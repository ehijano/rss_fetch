      <title>Why Algorithms Remain Unjust: Power Structures Surrounding Algorithmic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithms play an increasingly-significant role in our social lives. Unfortunately, they often perpetuate social injustices while doing so. The popular means of addressing these algorithmic injustices has been through algorithmic reformism: fine-tuning the algorithm itself to be more fair, accountable, and transparent. While commendable, the emerging discipline of critical algorithm studies shows that reformist approaches have failed to curtail algorithmic injustice because they ignore the power structure surrounding algorithms. Heeding calls from critical algorithm studies to analyze this power structure, I employ a framework developed by Erik Olin Wright to examine the configuration of power surrounding Algorithmic Activity: the ways in which algorithms are researched, developed, trained, and deployed within society. I argue that the reason Algorithmic Activity is unequal, undemocratic, and unsustainable is that the power structure shaping it is one of economic empowerment rather than social empowerment. For Algorithmic Activity to be socially just, we need to transform this power configuration to empower the people at the other end of an algorithm. To this end, I explore Wright's symbiotic, interstitial, and raptural transformations in the context of Algorithmic Activity, as well as how they may be applied in a hypothetical research project that uses algorithms to address a social issue. I conclude with my vision for socially just Algorithmic Activity, asking that future work strives to integrate the proposed transformations and develop new mechanisms for social empowerment.</description>

      <title>Public Technologies Transforming Work of the Public and the Public Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technologies adopted by the public sector have transformed the work practices of employees in public agencies by creating different means of communication and decision-making. Although much of the recent research in the future of work domain has concentrated on the effects of technological advancements on public sector employees, the influence on work practices of external stakeholders engaging with this sector remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on a digital platform called OneStop which is deployed by several building departments across the U.S. and aims to integrate various steps and services into a single point of online contact between public sector employees and the public. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 22 stakeholders, including local business owners, experts involved in the construction process, community representatives, and building department employees, we investigate how this technology transition has impacted the work of these different stakeholders. We observe a multifaceted perspective and experience caused by the adoption of OneStop. OneStop exacerbated inequitable practices for local business owners due to a lack of face-to-face interactions with the department employees. For the public sector employees, OneStop standardized the work practices, representing the building department's priorities and values. Based on our findings, we discuss tensions around standardization, equality, and equity in technology transition, as well as design implications for equitable practices in the public sector.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Partners in Student Essay Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the importance of comprehensive evaluation in workshop courses increases, there is a growing demand for efficient and fair assessment methods that reduce the workload for faculty members. This paper presents an evaluation conducted with Large Language Models (LLMs) using actual student essays in three scenarios: 1) without providing guidance such as rubrics, 2) with pre-specified rubrics, and 3) through pairwise comparison of essays. Quantitative analysis of the results revealed a strong correlation between LLM and faculty member assessments in the pairwise comparison scenario with pre-specified rubrics, although concerns about the quality and stability of evaluations remained. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative analysis of LLM assessment comments, showing that: 1) LLMs can match the assessment capabilities of faculty members, 2) variations in LLM assessments should be interpreted as diversity rather than confusion, and 3) assessments by humans and LLMs can differ and complement each other. In conclusion, this paper suggests that LLMs should not be seen merely as assistants to faculty members but as partners in evaluation committees and outlines directions for further research.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Systems Approach to Bots and Online Political Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bots have become increasingly prevalent in the digital sphere and have taken up a proactive role in shaping democratic processes. While previous studies have focused on their influence at the individual level, their potential macro-level impact on communication dynamics is still little understood. This study adopts an information theoretic approach from dynamical systems theory to examine the role of political bots shaping the dynamics of an online political discussion on Twitter. We quantify the components of this dynamic process in terms of its complexity, predictability, and the remaining uncertainty. Our findings suggest that bot activity is associated with increased complexity and uncertainty in the structural dynamics of online political communication. This work serves as a showcase for the use of information-theoretic measures from dynamical systems theory in modeling human-bot dynamics as a computational process that unfolds over time.</description>

      <title>On Perception of Prevalence of Cheating and Usage of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report investigates the perceptions of teaching staff on the prevalence of student cheating and the impact of Generative AI on academic integrity. Data was collected via an anonymous survey of teachers at the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University and analyzed alongside institutional statistics on cheating investigations from 2004 to 2023. The results indicate that while teachers generally do not view cheating as highly prevalent, there is a strong belief that its incidence is increasing, potentially due to the accessibility of Generative AI. Most teachers do not equate AI usage with cheating but acknowledge its widespread use among students. Furthermore, teachers' perceptions align with objective data on cheating trends, highlighting their awareness of the evolving landscape of academic dishonesty.</description>

      <title>An engine not a camera: Measuring performative power of online search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power of digital platforms is at the center of major ongoing policy and regulatory efforts. To advance existing debates, we designed and executed an experiment to measure the power of online search providers, building on the recent definition of performative power. Instantiated in our setting, performative power quantifies the ability of a search engine to steer web traffic by rearranging results. To operationalize this definition we developed a browser extension that performs unassuming randomized experiments in the background. These randomized experiments emulate updates to the search algorithm and identify the causal effect of different content arrangements on clicks. We formally relate these causal effects to performative power. Analyzing tens of thousands of clicks, we discuss what our robust quantitative findings say about the power of online search engines. More broadly, we envision our work to serve as a blueprint for how performative power and online experiments can be integrated with future investigations into the economic power of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Critical Urban Events using Mobile Phone Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network Signalling Data (NSD) have the potential to provide continuous spatio-temporal information about the presence, mobility, and usage patterns of cell phone services by individuals. Such information is invaluable for monitoring large urban areas and supporting the implementation of decision-making services. When analyzed in real time, NSD can enable the early detection of critical urban events, including fires, large accidents, stampedes, terrorist attacks, and sports and leisure gatherings, especially if these events significantly impact mobile phone network activity in the affected areas. This paper presents empirical evidence that advanced NSD can detect anomalies in mobile traffic service consumption, attributable to critical urban events, with fine spatial and temporal resolutions. We introduce two methodologies for real-time anomaly detection from multivariate time series extracted from large-scale NSD, utilizing a range of algorithms adapted from the state-of-the-art in unsupervised machine learning techniques for anomaly detection. Our research includes a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of these algorithms on a large-scale dataset of NSD service consumption for the Paris region. The evaluation uses an original dataset of documented critical or unusual urban events. This dataset has been built as a ground truth basis for assessing the algorithms performance. The obtained results demonstrate that our framework can detect unusual events almost instantaneously and locate the affected areas with high precision, largely outperforming random classifiers. This efficiency and effectiveness underline the potential of NSD-based anomaly detection in significantly enhancing emergency response strategies and urban planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hot topic of Artificial Intelligence right now is image generation from prompts. DALL-E 2 is one of the biggest names in this domain, as it allows people to create images from simple text inputs, to even more complicated ones. The company that made this possible, OpenAI, has assured everyone that visited their website that their mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity. A noble idea in our opinion, that also stood as the motive behind us choosing this subject. This paper analyzes the ethical implications of an AI image generative system, with an emphasis on how society is responding to it, how it probably will and how it should if all the right measures are taken.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Transparency and Participation through the Handoff Lens: Lessons Learned from the U.S. Census Bureau's Adoption of Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging discussions on the responsible government use of algorithmic technologies propose transparency and public participation as key mechanisms for preserving accountability and trust. But in practice, the adoption and use of any technology shifts the social, organizational, and political context in which it is embedded. Therefore translating transparency and participation efforts into meaningful, effective accountability must take into account these shifts. We adopt two theoretical frames, Mulligan and Nissenbaum's handoff model and Star and Griesemer's boundary objects, to reveal such shifts during the U.S. Census Bureau's adoption of differential privacy (DP) in its updated disclosure avoidance system (DAS) for the 2020 census. This update preserved (and arguably strengthened) the confidentiality protections that the Bureau is mandated to uphold, and the Bureau engaged in a range of activities to facilitate public understanding of and participation in the system design process. Using publicly available documents concerning the Census' implementation of DP, this case study seeks to expand our understanding of how technical shifts implicate values, how such shifts can afford (or fail to afford) greater transparency and participation in system design, and the importance of localized expertise throughout. We present three lessons from this case study toward grounding understandings of algorithmic transparency and participation: (1) efforts towards transparency and participation in algorithmic governance must center values and policy decisions, not just technical design decisions; (2) the handoff model is a useful tool for revealing how such values may be cloaked beneath technical decisions; and (3) boundary objects alone cannot bridge distant communities without trusted experts traveling alongside to broker their adoption.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Feedback of AI Price Estimations on Actual Market Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public availability of Artificial Intelligence generated information can change the markets forever, and its factoring into economical dynamics may take economists by surprise, out-dating models and schools of thought. Real estate hyper-inflation is not a new phenomenon but its consistent and almost monotonous persistence over 12 years, coinciding with prominence of public estimation information from Zillow, a successful Mass Real Estate Estimator (MREE), could not escape unobserved. What we model is a repetitive theoretical game between the MREE and the home owners, where each player has secret information and expertise. If the intention is to keep housing affordable and maintain old American lifestyle with broad home-ownership, new challenges are defined. Simulations show that a simple restriction of MREE-style price estimation availability to opt-in properties may help partially reduce feedback loop by acting on its likely causes, as suggested by experimental simulation models. The conjecture that the MREE pressure on real estate inflation rate is correlated with the absolute MREE estimation errors, which is logically explainable, is then validated in simulations.</description>

Abstract: GLOCON is a database of contentious events automatically extracted from national news sources from various countries in multiple languages. National news sources are utilized, and complete news archives are processed to create an event list for each source. Automation is achieved using a gold standard corpus sampled randomly from complete news archives (Y\"or\"uk et al. 2022) and all annotated by at least two domain experts based on the event definition provided in Duru\c{s}an et al. (2022).</description>

      <title>ChatGPT as the Marketplace of Ideas: Should Truth-Seeking Be the Goal of AI Content Governance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most enduring metaphors within legal discourse, the marketplace of ideas has wielded considerable influence over the jurisprudential landscape for decades. A century after the inception of this theory, ChatGPT emerged as a revolutionary technological advancement in the twenty-first century. This research finds that ChatGPT effectively manifests the marketplace metaphor. It not only instantiates the promises envisaged by generations of legal scholars but also lays bare the perils discerned through sustained academic critique. Specifically, the workings of ChatGPT and the marketplace of ideas theory exhibit at least four common features: arena, means, objectives, and flaws. These shared attributes are sufficient to render ChatGPT historically the most qualified engine for actualizing the marketplace of ideas theory.
  The comparison of the marketplace theory and ChatGPT merely marks a starting point. A more meaningful undertaking entails reevaluating and reframing both internal and external AI policies by referring to the accumulated experience, insights, and suggestions researchers have raised to fix the marketplace theory. Here, a pivotal issue is: should truth-seeking be set as the goal of AI content governance? Given the unattainability of the absolute truth-seeking goal, I argue against adopting zero-risk policies. Instead, a more judicious approach would be to embrace a knowledge-based alternative wherein large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate competing and divergent viewpoints based on sufficient justifications. This research also argues that so-called AI content risks are not created by AI companies but are inherent in the entire information ecosystem. Thus, the burden of managing these risks should be distributed among different social actors, rather than being solely shouldered by chatbot companies.</description>

      <title>Understanding Intrinsic Socioeconomic Biases in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into critical decision-making processes, such as loan approvals and visa applications, where inherent biases can lead to discriminatory outcomes. In this paper, we examine the nuanced relationship between demographic attributes and socioeconomic biases in LLMs, a crucial yet understudied area of fairness in LLMs. We introduce a novel dataset of one million English sentences to systematically quantify socioeconomic biases across various demographic groups. Our findings reveal pervasive socioeconomic biases in both established models such as GPT-2 and state-of-the-art models like Llama 2 and Falcon. We demonstrate that these biases are significantly amplified when considering intersectionality, with LLMs exhibiting a remarkable capacity to extract multiple demographic attributes from names and then correlate them with specific socioeconomic biases. This research highlights the urgent necessity for proactive and robust bias mitigation techniques to safeguard against discriminatory outcomes when deploying these powerful models in critical real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Towards Standardizing AI Bias Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating fair AI systems is a complex problem that involves the assessment of context-dependent bias concerns. Existing research and programming libraries express specific concerns as measures of bias that they aim to constrain or mitigate. In practice, one should explore a wide variety of (sometimes incompatible) measures before deciding which ones warrant corrective action, but their narrow scope means that most new situations can only be examined after devising new measures. In this work, we present a mathematical framework that distils literature measures of bias into building blocks, hereby facilitating new combinations to cover a wide range of fairness concerns, such as classification or recommendation differences across multiple multi-value sensitive attributes (e.g., many genders and races, and their intersections). We show how this framework generalizes existing concepts and present frequently used blocks. We provide an open-source implementation of our framework as a Python library, called FairBench, that facilitates systematic and extensible exploration of potential bias concerns.</description>

      <title>Are Large Language Models Chameleons?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) have their own worldviews and personality tendencies? Simulations in which an LLM was asked to answer subjective questions were conducted more than 1 million times. Comparison of the responses from different LLMs with real data from the European Social Survey (ESS) suggests that the effect of prompts on bias and variability is fundamental, highlighting major cultural, age, and gender biases. Methods for measuring the difference between LLMs and survey data are discussed, such as calculating weighted means and a new proposed measure inspired by Jaccard similarity. We conclude that it is important to analyze the robustness and variability of prompts before using LLMs to model individual decisions or collective behavior, as their imitation abilities are approximate at best.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: External audits of AI systems are increasingly recognized as a key mechanism for AI governance. The effectiveness of an audit, however, depends on the degree of access granted to auditors. Recent audits of state-of-the-art AI systems have primarily relied on black-box access, in which auditors can only query the system and observe its outputs. However, white-box access to the system's inner workings (e.g., weights, activations, gradients) allows an auditor to perform stronger attacks, more thoroughly interpret models, and conduct fine-tuning. Meanwhile, outside-the-box access to training and deployment information (e.g., methodology, code, documentation, data, deployment details, findings from internal evaluations) allows auditors to scrutinize the development process and design more targeted evaluations. In this paper, we examine the limitations of black-box audits and the advantages of white- and outside-the-box audits. We also discuss technical, physical, and legal safeguards for performing these audits with minimal security risks. Given that different forms of access can lead to very different levels of evaluation, we conclude that (1) transparency regarding the access and methods used by auditors is necessary to properly interpret audit results, and (2) white- and outside-the-box access allow for substantially more scrutiny than black-box access alone.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware Federated Minimax Optimization with Convergence Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04417</link>

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable attention due to its privacy-preserving feature. Nonetheless, the lack of freedom in managing user data can lead to group fairness issues, where models are biased towards sensitive factors such as race or gender. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, fair federated averaging with augmented Lagrangian method (FFALM), designed explicitly to address group fairness issues in FL. Specifically, we impose a fairness constraint on the training objective and solve the minimax reformulation of the constrained optimization problem. Then, we derive the theoretical upper bound for the convergence rate of FFALM. The effectiveness of FFALM in improving fairness is shown empirically on CelebA and UTKFace datasets in the presence of severe statistical heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>InterpretCC: Intrinsic User-Centric Interpretability through Global Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretability for neural networks is a trade-off between three key requirements: 1) faithfulness of the explanation (i.e., how perfectly it explains the prediction), 2) understandability of the explanation by humans, and 3) model performance. Most existing methods compromise one or more of these requirements; e.g., post-hoc approaches provide limited faithfulness, automatically identified feature masks compromise understandability, and intrinsically interpretable methods such as decision trees limit model performance. These shortcomings are unacceptable for sensitive applications such as education and healthcare, which require trustworthy explanations, actionable interpretations, and accurate predictions. In this work, we present InterpretCC (interpretable conditional computation), a family of interpretable-by-design neural networks that guarantee human-centric interpretability, while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art models by adaptively and sparsely activating features before prediction. We extend this idea into an interpretable, global mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that allows humans to specify topics of interest, discretely separates the feature space for each data point into topical subnetworks, and adaptively and sparsely activates these topical subnetworks for prediction. We apply variations of the InterpretCC architecture for text, time series and tabular data across several real-world benchmarks, demonstrating comparable performance with non-interpretable baselines, outperforming interpretable-by-design baselines, and showing higher actionability and usefulness according to a user study.</description>

      <title>Achievable Fairness on Your Data With Utility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning fairness, training models that minimize disparity across different sensitive groups often leads to diminished accuracy, a phenomenon known as the fairness-accuracy trade-off. The severity of this trade-off inherently depends on dataset characteristics such as dataset imbalances or biases and therefore, using a uniform fairness requirement across diverse datasets remains questionable. To address this, we present a computationally efficient approach to approximate the fairness-accuracy trade-off curve tailored to individual datasets, backed by rigorous statistical guarantees. By utilizing the You-Only-Train-Once (YOTO) framework, our approach mitigates the computational burden of having to train multiple models when approximating the trade-off curve. Crucially, we introduce a novel methodology for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates, thereby providing practitioners with a robust framework for auditing model fairness while avoiding false conclusions due to estimation errors. Our experiments spanning tabular (e.g., Adult), image (CelebA), and language (Jigsaw) datasets underscore that our approach not only reliably quantifies the optimum achievable trade-offs across various data modalities but also helps detect suboptimality in SOTA fairness methods.</description>

      <title>FairLENS: Assessing Fairness in Law Enforcement Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques have become powerful tools, enhancing efficiency in law enforcement scenarios. To ensure fairness for demographic groups in different acoustic environments, ASR engines must be tested across a variety of speakers in realistic settings. However, describing the fairness discrepancies between models with confidence remains a challenge. Meanwhile, most public ASR datasets are insufficient to perform a satisfying fairness evaluation. To address the limitations, we built FairLENS - a systematic fairness evaluation framework. We propose a novel and adaptable evaluation method to examine the fairness disparity between different models. We also collected a fairness evaluation dataset covering multiple scenarios and demographic dimensions. Leveraging this framework, we conducted fairness assessments on 1 open-source and 11 commercially available state-of-the-art ASR models. Our results reveal that certain models exhibit more biases than others, serving as a fairness guideline for users to make informed choices when selecting ASR models for a given real-world scenario. We further explored model biases towards specific demographic groups and observed that shifts in the acoustic domain can lead to the emergence of new biases.</description>
