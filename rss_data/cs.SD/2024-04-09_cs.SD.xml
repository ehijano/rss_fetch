      <title>"It is okay to be uncommon": Quantizing Sound Event Detection Networks on Hardware Accelerators with Uncommon Sub-Byte Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If our noise-canceling headphones can understand our audio environments, they can then inform us of important sound events, tune equalization based on the types of content we listen to, and dynamically adjust noise cancellation parameters based on audio scenes to further reduce distraction. However, running multiple audio understanding models on headphones with a limited energy budget and on-chip memory remains a challenging task. In this work, we identify a new class of neural network accelerators (e.g., NE16 on GAP9) that allows network weights to be quantized to different common (e.g., 8 bits) and uncommon bit-widths (e.g., 3 bits). We then applied a differentiable neural architecture search to search over the optimal bit-widths of a network on two different sound event detection tasks with potentially different requirements on quantization and prediction granularity (i.e., classification vs. embeddings for few-shot learning). We further evaluated our quantized models on actual hardware, showing that we reduce memory usage, inference latency, and energy consumption by an average of 62%, 46%, and 61% respectively compared to 8-bit models while maintaining floating point performance. Our work sheds light on the benefits of such accelerators on sound event detection tasks when combined with an appropriate search method.</description>

      <title>The NES Video-Music Database: A Dataset of Symbolic Video Game Music Paired with Gameplay Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural models are one of the most popular approaches for music generation, yet there aren't standard large datasets tailored for learning music directly from game data. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel dataset named NES-VMDB, containing 98,940 gameplay videos from 389 NES games, each paired with its original soundtrack in symbolic format (MIDI). NES-VMDB is built upon the Nintendo Entertainment System Music Database (NES-MDB), encompassing 5,278 music pieces from 397 NES games. Our approach involves collecting long-play videos for 389 games of the original dataset, slicing them into 15-second-long clips, and extracting the audio from each clip. Subsequently, we apply an audio fingerprinting algorithm (similar to Shazam) to automatically identify the corresponding piece in the NES-MDB dataset. Additionally, we introduce a baseline method based on the Controllable Music Transformer to generate NES music conditioned on gameplay clips. We evaluated this approach with objective metrics, and the results showed that the conditional CMT improves musical structural quality when compared to its unconditional counterpart. Moreover, we used a neural classifier to predict the game genre of the generated pieces. Results showed that the CMT generator can learn correlations between gameplay videos and game genres, but further research has to be conducted to achieve human-level performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail the mathematical formulation of the line of "functional quantizer" modules developed by the Mathematics and Music Lab (MML) at Michigan Technological University, for the VCV Rack software modular synthesizer platform, which allow synthesizer players to tune oscillators to new musical scales based on mathematical functions. For example, we describe the recently-released MML Logarithmic Quantizer (LOG QNT) module that tunes synthesizer oscillators to the non-Pythagorean musical scale introduced by pop band The Apples in Stereo.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Audio Deepfake Detection: Dataset and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) is essential for preventing the misuse of synthetic voices that may infringe on personal rights and privacy. Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models pose higher risks as they can clone voices with a single utterance. However, the existing ADD datasets are outdated, leading to suboptimal generalization of detection models. In this paper, we construct a new cross-domain ADD dataset comprising over 300 hours of speech data that is generated by five advanced zero-shot TTS models. To simulate real-world scenarios, we employ diverse attack methods and audio prompts from different datasets. Experiments show that, through novel attack-augmented training, the Wav2Vec2-large and Whisper-medium models achieve equal error rates of 4.1\% and 6.5\% respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate our models' outstanding few-shot ADD ability by fine-tuning with just one minute of target-domain data. Nonetheless, neural codec compressors greatly affect the detection accuracy, necessitating further research.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Non-Negative Matrix Factorization with Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a powerful technique for analyzing regularly-sampled data, i.e., data that can be stored in a matrix. For audio, this has led to numerous applications using time-frequency (TF) representations like the Short-Time Fourier Transform. However extending these applications to irregularly-spaced TF representations, like the Constant-Q transform, wavelets, or sinusoidal analysis models, has not been possible since these representations cannot be directly stored in matrix form. In this paper, we formulate NMF in terms of continuous functions (instead of fixed vectors) and show that NMF can be extended to a wider variety of signal classes that need not be regularly sampled.</description>

      <title>HyperTTS: Parameter Efficient Adaptation in Text to Speech using Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural speech synthesis, or text-to-speech (TTS), aims to transform a signal from the text domain to the speech domain. While developing TTS architectures that train and test on the same set of speakers has seen significant improvements, out-of-domain speaker performance still faces enormous limitations. Domain adaptation on a new set of speakers can be achieved by fine-tuning the whole model for each new domain, thus making it parameter-inefficient. This problem can be solved by Adapters that provide a parameter-efficient alternative to domain adaptation. Although famous in NLP, speech synthesis has not seen much improvement from Adapters. In this work, we present HyperTTS, which comprises a small learnable network, "hypernetwork", that generates parameters of the Adapter blocks, allowing us to condition Adapters on speaker representations and making them dynamic. Extensive evaluations of two domain adaptation settings demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving state-of-the-art performance in the parameter-efficient regime. We also compare different variants of HyperTTS, comparing them with baselines in different studies. Promising results on the dynamic adaptation of adapter parameters using hypernetworks open up new avenues for domain-generic multi-speaker TTS systems. The audio samples and code are available at https://github.com/declare-lab/HyperTTS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Gull, a generative multifunctional audio codec. Gull is a general purpose neural audio compression and decompression model which can be applied to a wide range of tasks and applications such as real-time communication, audio super-resolution, and codec language models. The key components of Gull include (1) universal-sample-rate modeling via subband modeling schemes motivated by recent progress in audio source separation, (2) gain-shape representations motivated by traditional audio codecs, (3) improved residual vector quantization modules for simpler training, (4) elastic decoder network that enables user-defined model size and complexity during inference time, (5) built-in ability for audio super-resolution without the increase of bitrate. We compare Gull with existing traditional and neural audio codecs and show that Gull is able to achieve on par or better performance across various sample rates, bitrates and model complexities in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Training for Depression Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous works on depression detection use datasets collected in similar environments to train and test the models. In practice, however, the train and test distributions cannot be guaranteed to be identical. Distribution shifts can be introduced due to variations such as recording environment (e.g., background noise) and demographics (e.g., gender, age, etc). Such distributional shifts can surprisingly lead to severe performance degradation of the depression detection models. In this paper, we analyze the application of test-time training (TTT) to improve robustness of models trained for depression detection. When compared to regular testing of the models, we find TTT can significantly improve the robustness of the model under a variety of distributional shifts introduced due to: (a) background-noise, (b) gender-bias, and (c) data collection and curation procedure (i.e., train and test samples are from separate datasets).</description>

      <title>SoundingActions: Learning How Actions Sound from Narrated Egocentric Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel self-supervised embedding to learn how actions sound from narrated in-the-wild egocentric videos. Whereas existing methods rely on curated data with known audio-visual correspondence, our multimodal contrastive-consensus coding (MC3) embedding reinforces the associations between audio, language, and vision when all modality pairs agree, while diminishing those associations when any one pair does not. We show our approach can successfully discover how the long tail of human actions sound from egocentric video, outperforming an array of recent multimodal embedding techniques on two datasets (Ego4D and EPIC-Sounds) and multiple cross-modal tasks.</description>

      <title>SpeechAlign: Aligning Speech Generation to Human Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech language models have significantly advanced in generating realistic speech, with neural codec language models standing out. However, the integration of human feedback to align speech outputs to human preferences is often neglected. This paper addresses this gap by first analyzing the distribution gap in codec language models, highlighting how it leads to discrepancies between the training and inference phases, which negatively affects performance. Then we explore leveraging learning from human feedback to bridge the distribution gap. We introduce SpeechAlign, an iterative self-improvement strategy that aligns speech language models to human preferences. SpeechAlign involves constructing a preference codec dataset contrasting golden codec tokens against synthetic tokens, followed by preference optimization to improve the codec language model. This cycle of improvement is carried out iteratively to steadily convert weak models to strong ones. Through both subjective and objective evaluations, we show that SpeechAlign can bridge the distribution gap and facilitating continuous self-improvement of the speech language model. Moreover, SpeechAlign exhibits robust generalization capabilities and works for smaller models. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/0nutation/SpeechGPT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end model designed to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) for a particular speaker in a crowded, noisy environment. The model utilizes a single-channel speech enhancement module that isolates the speaker's voice from background noise (ConVoiFilter) and an ASR module. The model can decrease ASR's word error rate (WER) from 80% to 26.4% through this approach. Typically, these two components are adjusted independently due to variations in data requirements. However, speech enhancement can create anomalies that decrease ASR efficiency. By implementing a joint fine-tuning strategy, the model can reduce the WER from 26.4% in separate tuning to 14.5% in joint tuning. We openly share our pre-trained model to foster further research hf.co/nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter.</description>

      <title>Echotune: A Modular Extractor Leveraging the Variable-Length Nature of Speech in ASR Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has proven to be highly effective for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks, becoming a foundational component for a plethora of research in the domain. Historically, many approaches have leaned on fixed-length attention windows, which becomes problematic for varied speech samples in duration and complexity, leading to data over-smoothing and neglect of essential long-term connectivity. Addressing this limitation, we introduce Echo-MSA, a nimble module equipped with a variable-length attention mechanism that accommodates a range of speech sample complexities and durations. This module offers the flexibility to extract speech features across various granularities, spanning from frames and phonemes to words and discourse. The proposed design captures the variable length feature of speech and addresses the limitations of fixed-length attention. Our evaluation leverages a parallel attention architecture complemented by a dynamic gating mechanism that amalgamates traditional attention with the Echo-MSA module output. Empirical evidence from our study reveals that integrating Echo-MSA into the primary model's training regime significantly enhances the word error rate (WER) performance, all while preserving the intrinsic stability of the original model.</description>

      <title>SALMONN: Towards Generic Hearing Abilities for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hearing is arguably an essential ability of artificial intelligence (AI) agents in the physical world, which refers to the perception and understanding of general auditory information consisting of at least three types of sounds: speech, audio events, and music. In this paper, we propose SALMONN, a speech audio language music open neural network, built by integrating a pre-trained text-based large language model (LLM) with speech and audio encoders into a single multimodal model. SALMONN enables the LLM to directly process and understand general audio inputs and achieve competitive performances on a number of speech and audio tasks used in training, such as automatic speech recognition and translation, auditory-information-based question answering, emotion recognition, speaker verification, and music and audio captioning etc. SALMONN also has a diverse set of emergent abilities unseen in the training, which includes but is not limited to speech translation to untrained languages, speech-based slot filling, spoken-query-based question answering, audio-based storytelling, and speech audio co-reasoning etc. The presence of cross-modal emergent abilities is studied, and a novel few-shot activation tuning approach is proposed to activate such abilities. To our knowledge, SALMONN is the first model of its type and can be regarded as a step towards AI with generic hearing abilities. The source code, model checkpoints and data are available at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.</description>

      <title>MLCA-AVSR: Multi-Layer Cross Attention Fusion based Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems degrade significantly in noisy environments, audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) systems aim to complement the audio stream with noise-invariant visual cues and improve the system's robustness. However, current studies mainly focus on fusing the well-learned modality features, like the output of modality-specific encoders, without considering the contextual relationship during the modality feature learning. In this study, we propose a multi-layer cross-attention fusion based AVSR (MLCA-AVSR) approach that promotes representation learning of each modality by fusing them at different levels of audio/visual encoders. Experimental results on the MISP2022-AVSR Challenge dataset show the efficacy of our proposed system, achieving a concatenated minimum permutation character error rate (cpCER) of 30.57% on the Eval set and yielding up to 3.17% relative improvement compared with our previous system which ranked the second place in the challenge. Following the fusion of multiple systems, our proposed approach surpasses the first-place system, establishing a new SOTA cpCER of 29.13% on this dataset.</description>

      <title>DiffSHEG: A Diffusion-Based Approach for Real-Time Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose DiffSHEG, a Diffusion-based approach for Speech-driven Holistic 3D Expression and Gesture generation with arbitrary length. While previous works focused on co-speech gesture or expression generation individually, the joint generation of synchronized expressions and gestures remains barely explored. To address this, our diffusion-based co-speech motion generation transformer enables uni-directional information flow from expression to gesture, facilitating improved matching of joint expression-gesture distributions. Furthermore, we introduce an outpainting-based sampling strategy for arbitrary long sequence generation in diffusion models, offering flexibility and computational efficiency. Our method provides a practical solution that produces high-quality synchronized expression and gesture generation driven by speech. Evaluated on two public datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, a user study confirms the superiority of DiffSHEG over prior approaches. By enabling the real-time generation of expressive and synchronized motions, DiffSHEG showcases its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.</description>

Abstract: This study assesses deep learning models for audio classification in a clinical setting with the constraint of small datasets reflecting real-world prospective data collection. We analyze CNNs, including DenseNet and ConvNeXt, alongside transformer models like ViT, SWIN, and AST, and compare them against pre-trained audio models such as YAMNet and VGGish. Our method highlights the benefits of pre-training on large datasets before fine-tuning on specific clinical data. We prospectively collected two first-of-their-kind patient audio datasets from stroke patients. We investigated various preprocessing techniques, finding that RGB and grayscale spectrogram transformations affect model performance differently based on the priors they learn from pre-training. Our findings indicate CNNs can match or exceed transformer models in small dataset contexts, with DenseNet-Contrastive and AST models showing notable performance. This study highlights the significance of incremental marginal gains through model selection, pre-training, and preprocessing in sound classification; this offers valuable insights for clinical diagnostics that rely on audio classification.</description>

      <title>Automatic Restoration of Diacritics for Speech Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic text-based diacritic restoration models generally have high diacritic error rates when applied to speech transcripts as a result of domain and style shifts in spoken language. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving the performance of automatic diacritic restoration when applied to speech data by utilizing parallel spoken utterances. In particular, we use the pre-trained Whisper ASR model fine-tuned on relatively small amounts of diacritized Arabic speech data to produce rough diacritized transcripts for the speech utterances, which we then use as an additional input for diacritic restoration models. The proposed framework consistently improves diacritic restoration performance compared to text-only baselines. Our results highlight the inadequacy of current text-based diacritic restoration models for speech data sets and provide a new baseline for speech-based diacritic restoration.</description>

      <title>Cooperation Does Matter: Exploring Multi-Order Bilateral Relations for Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, an audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task has been introduced, aiming to group pixels with sounding objects within a given video. This task necessitates a first-ever audio-driven pixel-level understanding of the scene, posing significant challenges. In this paper, we propose an innovative audio-visual transformer framework, termed COMBO, an acronym for COoperation of Multi-order Bilateral relatiOns. For the first time, our framework explores three types of bilateral entanglements within AVS: pixel entanglement, modality entanglement, and temporal entanglement. Regarding pixel entanglement, we employ a Siam-Encoder Module (SEM) that leverages prior knowledge to generate more precise visual features from the foundational model. For modality entanglement, we design a Bilateral-Fusion Module (BFM), enabling COMBO to align corresponding visual and auditory signals bi-directionally. As for temporal entanglement, we introduce an innovative adaptive inter-frame consistency loss according to the inherent rules of temporal. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on AVSBench-object (84.7 mIoU on S4, 59.2 mIou on MS3) and AVSBench-semantic (42.1 mIoU on AVSS) datasets demonstrate that COMBO surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. Code and more results will be publicly available at https://yannqi.github.io/AVS-COMBO/.</description>

      <title>360+x: A Panoptic Multi-modal Scene Understanding Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human perception of the world is shaped by a multitude of viewpoints and modalities. While many existing datasets focus on scene understanding from a certain perspective (e.g. egocentric or third-person views), our dataset offers a panoptic perspective (i.e. multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities). Specifically, we encapsulate third-person panoramic and front views, as well as egocentric monocular/binocular views with rich modalities including video, multi-channel audio, directional binaural delay, location data and textual scene descriptions within each scene captured, presenting comprehensive observation of the world. Figure 1 offers a glimpse of all 28 scene categories of our 360+x dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first database that covers multiple viewpoints with multiple data modalities to mimic how daily information is accessed in the real world. Through our benchmark analysis, we presented 5 different scene understanding tasks on the proposed 360+x dataset to evaluate the impact and benefit of each data modality and perspective in panoptic scene understanding. We hope this unique dataset could broaden the scope of comprehensive scene understanding and encourage the community to approach these problems from more diverse perspectives.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Multi-Lingual Speaker Verification in Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the substantial number of clinicians, patients, and data collection environments involved in clinical trials, gathering data of superior quality poses a significant challenge. In clinical trials, patients are assessed based on their speech data to detect and monitor cognitive and mental health disorders. We propose using these speech recordings to verify the identities of enrolled patients and identify and exclude the individuals who try to enroll multiple times in the same trial. Since clinical studies are often conducted across different countries, creating a system that can perform speaker verification in diverse languages without additional development effort is imperative. We evaluate pre-trained TitaNet, ECAPA-TDNN, and SpeakerNet models by enrolling and testing with speech-impaired patients speaking English, German, Danish, Spanish, and Arabic languages. Our results demonstrate that tested models can effectively generalize to clinical speakers, with less than 2.7% EER for European Languages and 8.26% EER for Arabic. This represents a significant step in developing more versatile and efficient speaker verification systems for cognitive and mental health clinical trials that can be used across a wide range of languages and dialects, substantially reducing the effort required to develop speaker verification systems for multiple languages. We also evaluate how speech tasks and number of speakers involved in the trial influence the performance and show that the type of speech tasks impacts the model performance.</description>

      <title>RALL-E: Robust Codec Language Modeling with Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present RALL-E, a robust language modeling method for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. While previous work based on large language models (LLMs) shows impressive performance on zero-shot TTS, such methods often suffer from poor robustness, such as unstable prosody (weird pitch and rhythm/duration) and a high word error rate (WER), due to the autoregressive prediction style of language models. The core idea behind RALL-E is chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which decomposes the task into simpler steps to enhance the robustness of LLM-based TTS. To accomplish this idea, RALL-E first predicts prosody features (pitch and duration) of the input text and uses them as intermediate conditions to predict speech tokens in a CoT style. Second, RALL-E utilizes the predicted duration prompt to guide the computing of self-attention weights in Transformer to enforce the model to focus on the corresponding phonemes and prosody features when predicting speech tokens. Results of comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that, compared to a powerful baseline method VALL-E, RALL-E significantly improves the WER of zero-shot TTS from $6.3\%$ (without reranking) and $2.1\%$ (with reranking) to $2.8\%$ and $1.0\%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RALL-E correctly synthesizes sentences that are hard for VALL-E and reduces the error rate from $68\%$ to $4\%$.</description>
