      <title>Non-Platonic Autopoiesis of a Cellular Automaton Glider in Asymptotic Lenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like Life, Lenia CA support a range of patterns that move, interact with their environment, and/or are modified by said interactions. These patterns maintain a cohesive, self-organizing morphology, i.e. they exemplify autopoiesis, the self-organization principle of a network of components and processes maintaining themselves. Recent work implementing Asymptotic Lenia as a reaction-diffusion system reported that non-Platonic behavior in standard Lenia may depend on the clipping function, and that ALenia gliders are likely not subject to non-Platonic instability. In this work I show an example of a glider in ALenia that depends on a certain simulation coarseness for autopoietic competence: when simulated with too fine spatial or temporal resolution the glider no longer maintains its morphology or dynamics. I also show that instability maps of the asymptotic Lenia glider, and others in different CA framworks, show fractal retention of fine boundary detail down to the limit of floating point precision.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattices in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating crystal bilayers twisted with respect to each other would lead to large periodic supercell structures, which can support a wide range of novel electron correlated phenomena, where the full understanding is still under debate. Here, we propose a new scheme to realize a nonlinearity-induced dynamical self-organized twisted-bilayer lattice in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The key idea here is to utilize the nonlinear effect from the intrinsic atomic interactions to couple different layers and induce a dynamical self-organized supercell structure, dramatically distinct from the conventional wisdom to achieve the static twisted-bilayer lattices. To illustrate that, we study the dynamics of a two-component BEC and show that the nonlinear interaction effect naturally emerged in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of interacting bosonic ultracold atoms can dynamically induce both periodic (commensurable) and aperiodic (incommensurable) moir\'{e} structures. One of the interesting moir\'{e} phenomena, i.e., the flat-band physics, is shown through investigating the dynamics of the wave packet of BEC. Our proposal can be implemented using available state-of-the-art experimental techniques and reveal a profound connection between the nonlinearity and twistronics in cold atom quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently established that self-healing slip pulses under uniform prestress $\tau_b$ are unstable frictional rupture modes, i.e., they either slowly expand/decay with time t. Furthermore, their dynamics were shown to follow a reduced-dimensionality description corresponding to a special $L(c)$ line in a plane defined by the pulse propagation velocity $c(t)$ and size $L(t)$. Yet, uniform prestress is rather the exception than the rule in natural faults. We study the effects of a spatially-varying prestress $\tau_b(x)$ on 2D slip pulses, initially generated under a uniform $\tau_b$ along a rate-and-state friction fault. We consider periodic and constant-gradient prestress $\tau_b(x)$ around the reference uniform $\tau_b$. For a periodic $\tau_b(x)$, pulses either sustain and form quasi-limit cycles in the $L-c$ plane or decay predominantly monotonically along the $L(c)$ line, depending on the instability index of the initial pulse and the properties of the periodic $\tau_b(x)$. For a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, expanding/decaying pulses closely follow the $L(c)$ line, with systematic shifts determined by the sign and magnitude of the gradient. We also find that a spatially-varying $\tau_b(x)$ can revert the expanding/decaying nature of the initial reference pulse. Finally, we show that a constant-gradient $\tau_b(x)$, of sufficient magnitude and specific sign, can lead to the nucleation of a back-propagating rupture at the healing tail of the initial pulse, generating a bilateral crack-like rupture. This pulse-to-crack transition, along with the above-described effects, demonstrate that rich rupture dynamics merge from a simple, nonuniform prestress. Furthermore, we show that as long as pulses exist, their dynamics are related to the special $L(c)$ line, providing an effective, reduced-dimensionality description of unsteady slip pulses under spatially-varying prestress.</description>

      <title>Soliton Condensates for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation: a Non-Bound State Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectral theory of soliton condensates - a special limit of soliton gases - for the focusing NLS (fNLS). In particular, we analyze the kinetic equation for the fNLS circular condensate, which represents the first example of an explicitly solvable fNLS condensate with nontrivial large scale space-time dynamics. Solution of the kinetic equation was obtained by reducing it to Whitham type equations for the endpoints of spectral arcs. We also study the rarefaction and dispersive shock waves for circular condensates, as well as calculate the corresponding average conserved quantities and the kurtosis. We want to note that one of the main objects of the spectral theory - the nonlinear dispersion relations - is introduced in the paper as some special large genus (thermodynamic) limit the Riemann bilinear identities that involve the quasimomentum and the quasienergy meromorphic differentials.</description>

      <title>Robustly encoding certainty in a metastable neural circuit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localized persistent neural activity can encode delayed estimates of continuous variables. Common experiments require that subjects store and report the feature value (e.g., orientation) of a particular cue (e.g., oriented bar on a screen) after a delay. Visualizing recorded activity of neurons along their feature tuning reveals activity bumps whose centers wander stochastically, degrading the estimate over time. Bump position therefore represents the remembered estimate. Recent work suggests bump amplitude may represent estimate certainty reflecting a probabilistic population code for a Bayesian posterior. Idealized models of this type are fragile due to the fine tuning common to constructed continuum attractors in dynamical systems. Here we propose an alternative metastable model for robustly supporting multiple bump amplitudes by extending neural circuit models to include quantized nonlinearities. Asymptotic projections of circuit activity produce low-dimensional evolution equations for the amplitude and position of bump solutions in response to external stimuli and noise perturbations. Analysis of reduced equations accurately characterizes phase variance and the dynamics of amplitude transitions between stable discrete values. More salient cues generate bumps of higher amplitude which wander less, consistent with the experimental finding that greater certainty correlates with more accurate memories.</description>
