      <title>Calibration of CMB Telescopes with PROTOCALC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic Microwave Background experiments need to measure polarization properties of the incoming radiation very accurately to achieve their scientific goals. As a result of that, it is necessary to properly characterize these instruments. However, there are not natural sources that can be used for this purpose. For this reason, we developed the PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, which is a calibrator source designed for the 90 GHz band of these telescopes. This source is purely polarized and the direction of the polarization vector is known with an accuracy better than 0.1 deg. This source flew for the first time in May 2022 showing promising result.</description>

      <title>Daytime turbulence strength profile measurement at Kodaikanal Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) is developing a Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) system for the Kodaikanal Tower Telescope (KTT). In this context, we have measured the daytime turbulence strength profile at the Kodaikanal Observatory. The first method based on wavefront sensor (WFS) images, called S-DIMM+ (Solar-Differential Image Motion Monitor+), was used to estimate the higher altitude turbulence up to a height of 5 - 6 km. The second method used balloon-borne temperature sensors to measure the near-Earth turbulence up to 350 m. We also carried out simulations to validate the performance of our system. We report the first-ever daytime turbulence strength profile measurements at the observatory. We have identified the presence of a strong turbulence layer about 3 km above the observatory. The measured near-Earth turbulence matches the trend that is expected from the model for daytime component of turbulence and gives an integrated $r_0$ of about 4 cm at 500 nm. This is consistent with earlier seeing measurements. This shows that a low-cost setup with a small telescope and a simple array of temperature sensors can be used for estimating the turbulence strength profile at the site.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Small Satellites: TheMIS's Active Cooling Technology on the SpIRIT Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thermal Management Integrated System (TheMIS) is a key element of the Australia-Italy Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) mission, launched in a 510km Polar Sun-Synchronous orbit in December 2023. SpIRIT is a 6U CubeSat led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with ASI, with support from ASA and with contributions from Australian space industry and international research organizations. The TheMIS subsystem actively cools and controls the temperature of sensitive instruments, increasing the potential range of payloads supported on small spacecraft systems. TheMIS core functionality is based on a commercial Stirling Cycle Cryocooler in-principle capable of reaching cold-tip temperatures below T=100K. The cooler is operated by customized control electronics and is connected to deployable radiators through pyrolytic graphite sheet thermal straps, all developed by the University of Melbourne. Until now, this level of thermal control has been relatively uncommon in nanosatellites. TheMIS aims to validate the design and performance by controlling the thermal environment of SpIRIT's HERMES payload, an X-ray instrument provided by ASI which has a noise background strongly sensitive to temperature. Beyond SpIRIT, TheMIS has the potential to support a broad range of applications, including holding infrared focal plane arrays at cryogenic temperatures, and increasing resilience of electronics to space weather. This paper provides an overview of TheMIS's design, implementation, and operational performance, detailing the commissioning phase and the early results obtained from its operations in orbit, with comparison to the thermal model developed during the mission environmental testing campaign. Finally, the paper discusses ongoing challenges for thermal management of payloads in small satellite systems and potential future strategies for continuous improvement</description>

      <title>SpIRIT Mission: In-Orbit Results and Technology Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) 6U CubeSat is a mission led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with the Italian Space Agency. Launched in a 510 km Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit in December 2023, SpIRIT carries multiple subsystems for scientific and technology demonstration. The main payload is the HERMES instrument for detection of high-energy astrophysics transients (Gamma Ray Bursts), and for studies of their variability at scales below 1 ms. The satellite includes a novel thermal management system for its class, based on a Stirling-cycle cooler and deployable thermal radiator, designed to cool HERMES to reduce instrumental background noise. A low-latency communication subsystem based on a sat-phone network is supporting rapid transmission of time-critical data and telecommands. SpIRIT is also equipped with a set of RGB and thermal IR cameras, connected to an on-board image processing unit with artificial intelligence capabilities for autonomous feature recognition. To effectively manage all interfaces between different subsystems and mission stakeholders, the University of Melbourne developed an instrument control unit (PMS) which operates all payloads. PMS also provides backup uninterruptible power to the HERMES instrument through a supercapacitor-based UPS for safe instrument shutdown in case of platform power interruptions. This paper first presents a mission and payload overview, and early in-orbit results, along with lessons learned throughout the mission. This work not only sheds light on the novelty of some of the on-board technologies onboard and on their potential impact to enable greater utilization of CubeSats for scientific missions, but also offers insights into the practical challenges and accomplishments related to developing and operating a multi-organization CubeSat with a complex array of instruments and systems.</description>

      <title>A "Rosetta Stone" for Studies of Spatial Variation in Astrophysical Data: Power Spectra, Semivariograms, and Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the turbulent interstellar medium to the cosmic web, astronomers in many different fields have needed to make sense of spatial data describing our Universe, spanning centimetre to Gigaparsec scales. Through different historical choices for mathematical conventions, many different subfields of spatial data analysis have evolved their own language for analysing structures and quantifying correlation in spatial data. Because of this history, terminology from a myriad of different fields is used, often to describe two data products that are mathematically identical. In this Note, we define and describe the differences and similarities between the power spectrum, the two-point correlation function, the covariance function, the semivariogram, and the structure functions, in an effort to unify the languages used to study spatial correlation. We also highlight under which conditions these data products are useful and describe how the results found using one method can be translated to those found using another, allowing for easier comparison between different subfields' native methods. We hope for this document to be a ``Rosetta Stone" for translating between different statistical approaches, allowing results to be shared between researchers from different backgrounds, facilitating more cross-disciplinary approaches to data analysis.</description>

      <title>The end-to-end simulator of the ATHENA X-IFU Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-IFU is one of the two instruments of ATHENA, the next ESA large X-ray observatory. It is a cryogenic spectrometer based on an array of TES microcalorimeters. To reduce the particle background, the TES array works in combination with a Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC). The CryoAC is a 4-pixel detector, based on ~1 cm2 silicon absorbers sensed by Ir/Au TES. It is required to have a wide energy bandwidth (from 20 keV to ~1 MeV), high efficiency (&lt; 0.014% missed particles), low dead-time (&lt; 1%) and good time-tagging accuracy (10 us at 1 sigma). An end-to-end simulator of the CryoAC detector has been developed both for design and performance assessment, consisting of several modules. First, the in-flight flux of background particles is evaluated by Geant4 simulations. Then, the current flow in the TES is evaluated by solving the electro-thermal equations of microcalorimeters, and the detector output signal is generated by simulating the SQUID FLL dynamics. Finally, the output is analyzed by a high-efficiency trigger algorithm, producing the simulated CryoAC telemetry. Here, we present in detail this end-to-end simulator, and how we are using it to define the new CryoAC baseline configuration in the new Athena context.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness Study of Calibration and Correction Algorithms on the Prototype of the POLAR-2/LPD Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaseous X-ray polarimetry refers to a class of detectors used for measuring the polarization of soft X-rays. The systematic effects of such detectors introduce residual modulation, leading to systematic biases in the polarization detection results of the source. This paper discusses the systematic effects and their calibration and correction using the Gas Microchannel Plate-Pixel Detector (GMPD) prototype for POLAR-2/Low-Energy X-ray Polarization Detector (LPD). Additionally, we propose an algorithm that combines parameterization with Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian iteration to eliminate residual modulation. The residual modulation after data correction at different energy points has been reduced to below 1%, and a good linear relationship is observed between the polarization degree and modulation degree. The improvement in modulation degree after correction ranges from 2% to 15%, and the results exceed those of the Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) above 5 keV.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Provenance Serialisations for Astronomical Provenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provenance data from astronomical pipelines are instrumental in establishing trust and reproducibility in the data processing and products. In addition, astronomers can query their provenance to answer questions routed in areas such as anomaly detection, recommendation, and prediction. The next generation of astronomical survey telescopes such as the Vera Rubin Observatory or Square Kilometre Array, are capable of producing peta to exabyte scale data, thereby amplifying the importance of even small improvements to the efficiency of provenance storage or querying. In order to determine how astronomers should store and query their provenance data, this paper reports on a comparison between the turtle and JSON provenance serialisations. The triple store Apache Jena Fuseki and the graph database system Neo4j were selected as representative database management systems (DBMS) for turtle and JSON, respectively. Simulated provenance data was uploaded to and queried over each DBMS and the metrics measured for comparison were the accuracy and timing of the queries as well as the data upload times. It was found that both serialisations are competent for this purpose, and both have similar query accuracy. The turtle provenance was found to be more efficient at storing and uploading the data. Regarding queries, for small datasets ($&lt;$5MB) and simple information retrieval queries, the turtle serialisation was also found to be more efficient. However, queries for JSON serialised provenance were found to be more efficient for more complex queries which involved matching patterns across the DBMS, this effect scaled with the size of the queried provenance.</description>

      <title>Atmosphyre: Modelling Atmospheric Chromatic Dispersion for Multi-Object Spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavelength dependent refraction of light in the atmosphere causes the chromatic dispersion of a target on the focal plane of an instrument. This is known as atmospheric dispersion, with one of the consequences being wavelength dependent flux losses which are difficult to minimise, requiring analysis in both instrument design and operations. We present Atmosphyre, a novel python package developed to characterise the impact of atmospheric dispersion on a spectrograph, with a focus on fibre multi-object spectrographs (MOS) which will be at the forefront of ground-based astronomy for the next few decades.
  We show example simulations and provide recommendations for minimising fibre MOS flux losses. We conclude that the guiding wavelength should typically be bluer than the observing band mid-wavelength, around 25-45% of the way through the band. The aperture should be centred on this wavelength's location on the focal plane. This wavelength/position remains constant for all reasonable declinations and target hour angles. We also present an application of the package to MOSAIC, the ELT's multi-object spectrograph. We find that differential losses greater than 10% are unavoidable for 1h observations that are a) after a local hour angle of 2.5h, or b) at declinations below -60 degrees and above 10 degrees. We identify that the introduction of an atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) would result in the significant reduction of spectral distortions, a gain in survey speed for many observations, and enable the implementation of wider visible observing bands; as a result, there has been a proposal to adopt ADCs at a positioner level for MOSAIC. Future work includes adding field differential refraction to Atmosphyre, important for future wide-field multi-object spectrograph projects such as the proposed WST.</description>

      <title>Flexure based fibre positioners: design optimisation to follow arbitrary focal plane curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of flexures to achieve fibre positioner motion is being actively investigated by several institutes, for example at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) and Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam. One challenge when designing with flexures is the large number of degrees of freedom available which makes it difficult or impossible to optimise their motion by hand. In this paper we demonstrate two approaches for optimising flexure geometry to follow arbitrary focal surface curvature and to orient the optical fibre with arbitrary tilt. These approaches are: analytical using MATLAB models and FEA based using Ansys. The approaches are complementary allowing the designer to efficiently explore the parameter space and then do precise optimisation of the flexure geometry. We demonstrate the applicability both to the UKATCs preferred design for WST, and to flexure-based fibre positioner designs generally. We also present a sensitivity analysis relating small changes in design parameters to changes in fibre tip motion. Finally we briefly present the UKATCs preferred geometry for the WST fibre positioner.</description>

      <title>ALF: an asymmetric Lyot wavefront sensor for the ELT/METIS vortex coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-common path quasi-static and differential aberrations are one of the big hurdles of direct imaging for current and future high-contrast imaging instruments. They increase speckle and photon noise thus reducing the achievable contrast and lead to a significant hit in HCI performance. The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) will provide high-contrast imaging, including vortex coronagraphy in L, M and N bands, with the ultimate goal of directly imaging temperate rocky planets around the nearest stars. Ground-based mid-infrared observations are however also impacted by water vapor inhomogeneities in the atmosphere, which generate additional chromatic turbulence not corrected by the near-infrared adaptive optics. This additional source of wavefront error (WFE) significantly impacts HCI performance, and even dominates the WFE budget in N band. Instantaneous focal plane wavefront sensing is thus required to mitigate its impact. In this context, we propose to implement a novel wavefront sensing approach for the vortex coronagraph using an asymmetric Lyot stop and machine learning. The asymmetric pupil stop allows for the problem to become solvable, lifting the ambiguity on the sign of even Zernike modes. Choosing the Lyot plane instead of the entrance pupil for this mask is also not arbitrary: it preserves the rejection efficiency of the coronagraph and minimizes the impact of the asymmetry on the throughput. Last but not least, machine learning allows us to solve this inversion problem which is non-linear and lacks an analytical solution. In this contribution, we present our concept, our simulation framework, our results and a first laboratory demonstration of the technique.</description>

      <title>Vortex coronagraph: revisiting the phase retrieval properties via Zernike analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High contrast imaging (HCI) is fundamentally limited by wavefront aberrations, and the ability to perform wavefront sensing from focal plane images is key to reach the full potential of ground and space-based instruments. Vortex focal plane mask coupled with downstream pupil (Lyot) stop stands as one of the best small-angle coronagraphs, but is also sensitive to low-order aberrations. Here, we revisit the behavior of the vortex phase mask, from entrance pupil down to the final detector plane, with Zernike polynomials as input phase aberrations. In particular we develop a second-order expansion that allows us to analyze the phase retrieval properties in a more intuitive and accurate way than previously proposed. With this formalism, we show how the azimuthal vortex modulation modifies the phase retrieval properties compared to normal imaging. In particular, our results suggest that images obtained with a scalar vortex coronagraph can be used for unambiguous focal-plane wavefront sensing in any practical situation. We compare our results with numerical simulations and discuss practical implementation in coronagraphic instruments.</description>

      <title>The VLT/ERIS vortex coronagraph: design, pointing control, and on-sky performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is the new near-infrared instrument at the VLT-UT4. ERIS replaces and extends the observational capabilities formerly provided by SINFONI and NACO: integral field spectroscopy at 1 - 2.5 $\mu$m, imaging at 1 - 5 $\mu$m with several options for high-contrast imaging, and long-slit spectroscopy. In particular, a vortex coronagraph is now available for high contrast observations at L and M band. It is implemented using annular groove (or vortex) phase masks (one for each of the L and M bands) in a focal plane, and a Lyot stop in a downstream pupil plane. The vortex coronagraph has a discovery space starting already at $\sim$1$\lambda/D$, and works well in broadbands. However, to reach its optimal performance, it is critical to correct for slow pointing errors onto the vortex phase mask, which mandates a dedicated pointing control strategy. To do so, a control loop based on the QACITS algorithm has been developed and commissioned for ERIS. Good pointing stability is now regularly achieved with errors between 0.01 and 0.02 $\lambda/D$ and a correction rate of 0.2 Hz. In this contribution, we first review the design of the ERIS vortex coronagraph. We then detail the implementation of the QACITS algorithm describing the entire observing sequence, including the calibration steps, the initial centering, and the stabilization during the observing template. We then discuss performance based on commissioning data in terms of pointing accuracy and stability. Finally, we present post-processed contrast curves obtained during commissioning and compare them with NACO vortex data, showing a significant improvement of about 1 mag at all separations.</description>

The stage is being developed for use in the Magellan InfraRed Multi-Object Spectrograph, MIRMOS. MIRMOS is a very large Nasmyth mounted spectrograph containing a combination of refractive, reflective and diffractive optics mounted on a long cryogenic optical bench. The instrument utilizes five science cameras, each having a custom x-y stage to control the in-plane detector position within each camera, providing both dithering capability for improved sampling, and flexure compensation to correct for image motion that results from the gravity variant operation of the instrument. Designed to operate at 120~K, the stage will accurately control detector position in two orthogonal degrees of freedom, and have manual fine adjustment features to set detector tip, tilt and piston. The piezo-driven flexure stage provides high-resolution backlash-free motion of the detector and is very compact along the optical path, keeping camera length to a minimum. A magnetoresistive bridge provides position feedback in each degree of freedom, greatly reducing hysteresis, which is common in piezoelectric actuators. The system is designed to operate in open loop using a lookup table keyed to the Nasmyth rotator angle for flexure control. Here, the optomechanical design of the stage, electrical control system, and current performance results from early prototype efforts are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>The Impact of $\texttt{CLEAN}$ing on Strong Gravitational Lens Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparison of image and uv-plane galaxy-galaxy strong lensing modelling results for simulated ALMA observations with different antenna configurations and on-source integration times. Image-plane modelling is carried out via use of the $\texttt{CLEAN}$ algorithm, and we explore the effects of different visibility weighting schemes on the inferred lens model parameters. We find that direct modelling of the visibility data consistently outperforms image-plane modelling for both the naturally and Briggs-weighted images. We also find that the modelling of images created with Briggs weighting generally produces more accurate results than those obtained by modelling images constructed with natural weighting. We explain this by quantifying the suppression of information due to $\texttt{CLEAN}$ing on scales at which the modelling is sensitive, and how this differs between Briggs and natural weighting. At higher resolutions, the differences between the lens modelling techniques are much less pronounced and overall, modelling errors are significantly reduced. We also find that time-binning the visibilities by up to a factor of three makes no significant difference to the inferred lens parameters when directly modelling in the uv-plane. This work provides some guidance on navigating the many choices faced when modelling strong lens interferometric imaging data.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Messenger Search for Exotic Field Emission with a Global Magnetometer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis method to search for exotic low-mass field (ELF) bursts generated during large energy astrophysical events such as supernovae, binary black hole or binary neutron star mergers, and fast radio bursts using the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics searches (GNOME). In our model, the associated gravitational waves or electromagnetic signals herald the arrival of the ELF burst that interacts via coupling to the spin of fermions in the magnetometers. This enables GNOME to serve as a tool for multi-messenger astronomy. The algorithm employs a model-agnostic excess-power method to identify network-wide candidate events to be subjected to a model-dependent generalized likelihood-ratio test to determine their statistical significance. We perform the first search with this technique on GNOME data coincident with the binary black hole merger S200311bg detected by LIGO/Virgo on the 11th of March 2020 and find no significant events. We place the first lab-based limits on combinations of ELF production and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Formation and desorption of sulfur chains (H$_2$S$_x$ and S$_x$) in cometary ice: effects of ice composition and temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reservoir of sulfur accounting for sulfur depletion in the gas of dense clouds and circumstellar regions is still unclear. One possibility is the formation of sulfur chains, which would be difficult to detect by spectroscopic techniques. This work explores the formation of sulfur chains experimentally, both in pure H$_2$S ice samples and in H$_2$O:H$_2$S ice mixtures. An ultra-high vacuum chamber, ISAC, eqquipped with FTIR and QMS, was used for the experiments. Our results show that the formation of H$_2$S$_x$ species is efficient, not only in pure H$_2$S ice samples, but also in water-rich ice samples. Large sulfur chains are formed more efficiently at low temperatures ($\approx$10 K), while high temperatures ($\approx$50 K) favour the formation of short sulfur chains. Mass spectra of H$_2$S$_x$, x~=~2-6, species are presented for the first time. Their analysis suggests that H$_2$S$_x$ species are favoured in comparison with S$_x$ chains. Nevertheless, the detection of several S$_x^+$ fragments at high temperatures in H$_2$S:H$_2$O ice mixtures suggests the presence of S$_8$ in the irradiated ice samples, which could sublimate from 260~K. ROSINA instrument data from the cometary Rosetta mission detected mass-to-charge ratios 96 and 128. Comparing these detections with our experiments, we propose two alternatives: 1) H$_2$S$_4$ and H$_2$S$_5$ to be responsible of those S$_3^+$ and S$_4^+$ cations, respectively, or 2) S$_8$ species, sublimating and being fragmented in the mass spectrometer. If S$_8$ is the parent molecule, then S$_5^+$ and S$_6^+$ cations could be also detected in future missions by broadening the mass spectrometer range.</description>

      <title>Structure preserving hybrid Finite Volume Finite Element method for compressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we present a novel and efficient numerical method for the compressible viscous and resistive MHD equations for all Mach number regimes. The time-integration strategy is a semi-implicit splitting, combined with a hybrid finite-volume and finite-element (FE) discretization in space. The non-linear convection is solved by a robust explicit FV scheme, while the magneto-acoustic terms are treated implicitly in time. The resulting CFL stability condition depends only on the fluid velocity, and not on the Alfv\'enic and acoustic modes. The magneto-acoustic terms are discretized by compatible FE based on a continuous and a discrete de Rham complexes designed using Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). Thanks to the use of FEEC, energy stability, magnetic-helicity conservation and the divergence-free conditions can be preserved also at the discrete level. A very efficient splitting approach is used to separate the acoustic and the Alfv\'enic modes in such a fashion that the original symmetries of the PDE governing equations are preserved. In this way, the algorithm relies on the solution of linear, symmetric and positive-definite algebraic systems, that are very efficiently handled by the simple matrix-free conjugate-gradient method. The resulting algorithm showed to be robust and accurate in low and high Mach regimes even at large Courant numbers. Non-trivial tests are solved in one-, two- and three- space dimensions to confirm the robustness, accuracy, and the low-dissipative and conserving properties of the final algorithm. While the formulation of the method is very general, numerical results for a second-order accurate FV-FE scheme will be presented.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, we aim to summarise the efforts of the Italian SKA scientific community in conducting surveys of star-forming regions within our Galaxy, in the development of astrochemical research on protostellar envelopes and disks, and in studying the planet formation process itself. The objective is dual: Firstly, to investigate the accumulation and development of dust throughout the formation of planets, and secondly, to chemically examine protoplanetary disks and protostellar envelopes by studying heavy molecules, such as chains and rings containing over seven carbon atoms, which exhibit significantly reduced strength at millimeter wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Non-Negative Matrix Factorization on Noisy Data With Negative Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimensionality reduction technique that has shown promise for analyzing noisy data, especially astronomical data. For these datasets, the observed data may contain negative values due to noise even when the true underlying physical signal is strictly positive. Prior NMF work has not treated negative data in a statistically consistent manner, which becomes problematic for low signal-to-noise data with many negative values. In this paper we present two algorithms, Shift-NMF and Nearly-NMF, that can handle both the noisiness of the input data and also any introduced negativity. Both of these algorithms use the negative data space without clipping, and correctly recover non-negative signals without any introduced positive offset that occurs when clipping negative data. We demonstrate this numerically on both simple and more realistic examples, and prove that both algorithms have monotonically decreasing update rules.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as Expectation Maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>

      <title>Accurate field-level weak lensing inference for precision cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{Miko}$, a catalog-to-cosmology pipeline for general flat-sky field-level inference, which provides access to cosmological information beyond the two-point statistics. In the context of weak lensing, we identify several new field-level analysis systematics (such as aliasing, Fourier mode-coupling, and density-induced shape noise), quantify their impact on cosmological constraints, and correct the biases to a percent level. Next, we find that model misspecification can lead to both absolute bias and incorrect uncertainty quantification for the inferred cosmological parameters in realistic simulations. The Gaussian map prior infers unbiased cosmological parameters, regardless of the true data distribution, but it yields overconfident uncertainties. The log-normal map prior quantifies the uncertainties accurately, although it requires careful calibration of the shift parameters for unbiased cosmological parameters. We demonstrate systematics control down to the $2\%$ level for both models, making them suitable for ongoing weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) searches for analytical expressions representing the relationship between a set of explanatory and response variables. Current SR methods assume a single dataset extracted from a single experiment. Nevertheless, frequently, the researcher is confronted with multiple sets of results obtained from experiments conducted with different setups. Traditional SR methods may fail to find the underlying expression since the parameters of each experiment can be different. In this work we present Multi-View Symbolic Regression (MvSR), which takes into account multiple datasets simultaneously, mimicking experimental environments, and outputs a general parametric solution. This approach fits the evaluated expression to each independent dataset and returns a parametric family of functions f(x; theta) simultaneously capable of accurately fitting all datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MvSR using data generated from known expressions, as well as real-world data from astronomy, chemistry and economy, for which an a priori analytical expression is not available. Results show that MvSR obtains the correct expression more frequently and is robust to hyperparameters change. In real-world data, it is able to grasp the group behavior, recovering known expressions from the literature as well as promising alternatives, thus enabling the use of SR to a large range of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Combining reference-star and angular differential imaging for high-contrast imaging of extended sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging (HCI) is a technique designed to observe faint signals near bright sources, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The primary challenge in revealing the faint circumstellar signal near a star is the presence of quasi-static speckles, which can produce patterns on the science images that are as bright, or even brighter, than the signal of interest. Strategies such as angular differential imaging (ADI) or reference-star differential imaging (RDI) aim to provide a means of removing the quasi-static speckles in post-processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the adaptation of state-of-the-art algorithms, initially designed for ADI, to jointly leverage angular and reference-star differential imaging (ARDI) for direct high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks. Using a collection of high-contrast imaging data sets, we assess the performance of ARDI in comparison to ADI and RDI based on iterative principal component analysis (IPCA). These diverse data sets are acquired under various observing conditions and include the injection of synthetic disk models at various contrast levels. Our results demonstrate that ARDI with IPCA improves the quality of recovered disk images and the sensitivity to planets embedded in disks, compared to ADI or RDI individually. This enhancement is particularly pronounced when dealing with extended sources exhibiting highly ambiguous structures that cannot be accurately retrieved using ADI alone, and when the quality of the reference frames is suboptimal, leading to an underperformance of RDI. We finally apply our method to a sample of real observations of protoplanetary disks taken in star-hopping mode, and propose to revisit the protoplanetary claims associated with these disks.</description>
