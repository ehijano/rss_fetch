      <title>A Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Work-in-Progress Predictio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work-in-Progress (WiP) prediction is critical for predictive process monitoring, enabling accurate anticipation of workload fluctuations and optimized operational planning. This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines. The results highlight improved robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning in WiP prediction.</description>

      <title>When Natural Strategies Meet Fuzziness and Resource-Bounded Actions (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In formal strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents are typically assumed to (i) employ arbitrarily complex strategies, (ii) execute each move at zero cost, and (iii) operate over fully crisp game structures. These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE. We implement our algorithms in VITAMIN, an open source model checking tool for MAS and validate them on an adversarial resource aware drone rescue scenario.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional human-AI collaboration in brain tumour assessments improves both expert human and AI agent performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) human partnerships-evaluating how AI agents enhance expert human performance-are increasingly studied. Though rarely evaluated in healthcare, an inverse approach is possible: AI benefiting from the support of an expert human agent. Here, we investigate both human-AI clinical partnership paradigms in the magnetic resonance imaging-guided characterisation of patients with brain tumours. We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists. Moreover, the greatest patient benefit was evident with an AI agent supported by a human one. Synergistic improvements in agent accuracy, metacognitive performance, and inter-rater agreement suggest that AI can create more capable, confident, and consistent clinical agents, whether human or model-based. Our work suggests that the maximal value of AI in healthcare could emerge not from replacing human intelligence, but from AI agents that routinely leverage and amplify it.</description>

      <title>Learning to Design City-scale Transit Routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Anomaly Thoughts with Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.</description>

      <title>LongVideoAgent: Multi-Agent Reasoning with Long Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Distributed Load Balancing: Static and Dynamic Game Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in job scheduling, queuing networks, and load balancing in cyber-physical systems, we develop and analyze a game-theoretic framework to balance the load among servers in static and dynamic settings. In these applications, jobs/tasks are held by selfish entities that do not want to coordinate with each other, yet the goal is to balance the load among servers in a distributed manner. First, we provide a static game formulation in which each player holds a job with a specific processing requirement and wants to schedule it fractionally among a set of heterogeneous servers to minimize its average processing time. We show that this static game is a potential game with a pure Nash equilibrium (NE). In particular, the best-response dynamics converge to such an NE after $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of players. Additionally, we bound the price of anarchy (PoA) of the static game in terms of game parameters. We then extend our results to a dynamic game setting, where jobs arrive and get processed, and players observe the load on the servers to decide how to schedule their jobs. In this setting, we show that if the players update their strategies using dynamic best-response, the system eventually becomes fully load-balanced and the players' strategies converge to the pure NE of the static game. In particular, we show that the convergence time scales only polynomially with respect to the game parameters. Finally, we provide numerical results to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verifiers--functions assigning rewards to agent behavior--have been key for AI progress in domains like math and code. However, extending gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g., computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize desired outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is nontrivial. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: a strong tendency to over-validate agent behavior, a phenomenon we term agreement bias. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and poses risks to existing methods relying on MLLM evaluations. We discuss methods to evaluate and improve MLLM verifiers and introduce Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that harnesses MLLMs' own sampling mechanisms by modulating (un)conditional generation to better leverage their knowledge, alignment, and reasoning. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to generate broad priors about desired behavior, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. SGV yields more human-aligned evaluations with gains of up to 25pp in failure detection, 14pp in accuracy, and benefits extending to downstream applications. In self-refinement and online supervision, SGV boosts task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena--setting a new state of the art, surpassing the previous best by 20pp. We release an updated version of VisualWebArena featuring more human-aligned evaluators, high-fidelity environment parallelism, and speedups of over 10x.</description>

      <title>CardAIc-Agents: A Multimodal Framework with Hierarchical Adaptation for Cardiac Care Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers. Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap through automated detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical application remains limited by: 1) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive reasoning that select specific tests and, based on their results, guides personalised next steps; 2) reliance solely on intrinsic model capabilities to perform role assignment without domain-specific tool support; 3) general and static knowledge bases without continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and lack of on-demand visual outputs when clinicians require visual clarification. In response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks. First, a CardiacRAG agent generated task-aware plans from updatable cardiac knowledge, while the Chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these plans and deliver decisions. Second, to enable adaptive and case-specific customization, a stepwise update strategy was developed to dynamically refine plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as complex. Third, a multidisciplinary discussion team was proposed which was automatically invoked to interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. In addition, visual review panels were provided to assist validation when clinicians raised concerns. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art agentic systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Intelligence for Multidisciplinary Decision-Making in Gastrointestinal Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal clinical reasoning in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) oncology necessitates the integrated interpretation of endoscopic imagery, radiological data, and biochemical markers. Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy. The findings indicate that mimetic, agent-based collaboration provides a scalable, interpretable, and clinically robust paradigm for automated decision support in oncology.</description>
