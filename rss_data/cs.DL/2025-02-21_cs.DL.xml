      <title>Bibliometric Analysis of Scientific Production on the COVID-19 Effect in Information Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the scientific production on the COVID-19 effect in the area of Information Sciences from a bibliometric perspective. The objectives focused on: 1) determining the most productive authors, countries, institutions and journals; 2) identifying the sources that constitute the core of scientific production; 3) examining the manuscripts with the greatest impact; and 4) visualizing the thematic and conceptual structure of the scientific domain analyzed. Bibliometric indicators and factor analysis techniques were used for data analysis. A total of 1,175 publications indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) core collection from 2020 to 2022 were retrieved. The results showed that the most relevant countries were the United States, United Kingdom, China and Spain. The core of the scientific production was formed by the publications: Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, Information Professional, Scientometrics and Journal of Health Communication. The papers with the greatest impact were concentrated in those dedicated to the analysis of the role of telemedicine in medical care. The conceptual structure showed the main research fronts, such as the role of telehealth, academic libraries and digital literacy in the fight against the pandemic, the role of social networks in the health crisis, as well as the problem of misinformation and fake news</description>

      <title>Linking Science and Industry: Influence of Scientific Research on Technological Innovation through Patent Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the connection between patent citations and scientific publications across six fields: Biochemistry, Genetics, Pharmacology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics. Analysing 117,590 papers from 2014 to 2023, the research emphasises how publication year, open access (OA) status, and discipline influence patent citations. Openly accessible papers, particularly those in hybrid OA journals or green OA repositories, are significantly more likely to be cited in patents, seven times more than those mentioned in blogs, and over twice as likely compared to older publications. However, papers with policy-related references are less frequently cited, indicating that patents may prioritise commercially viable innovations over those addressing societal challenges. Disciplinary differences reveal distinct innovation patterns across sectors. While academic visibility via blogs or platforms like Mendeley increases within scholarly circles, these have limited impact on patent citations. The study also finds that increased funding, possibly tied to applied research trends and fully open access journals, negatively affects patent citations. Social media presence and the number of authors have minimal impact. These findings highlight the complex factors shaping the integration of scientific research into technological innovations.</description>

      <title>NLP-AKG: Few-Shot Construction of NLP Academic Knowledge Graph Based on LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied in question answering over scientific research papers. To enhance the professionalism and accuracy of responses, many studies employ external knowledge augmentation. However, existing structures of external knowledge in scientific literature often focus solely on either paper entities or domain concepts, neglecting the intrinsic connections between papers through shared domain concepts. This results in less comprehensive and specific answers when addressing questions that combine papers and concepts. To address this, we propose a novel knowledge graph framework that captures deep conceptual relations between academic papers, constructing a relational network via intra-paper semantic elements and inter-paper citation relations. Using a few-shot knowledge graph construction method based on LLM, we develop NLP-AKG, an academic knowledge graph for the NLP domain, by extracting 620,353 entities and 2,271,584 relations from 60,826 papers in ACL Anthology. Based on this, we propose a 'sub-graph community summary' method and validate its effectiveness on three NLP scientific literature question answering datasets.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Predict Citation Intent? An Experimental Analysis of In-context Learning and Fine-tuning on Open LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the ability of open Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict citation intent through in-context learning and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on pre-trained models like SciBERT, which require extensive domain-specific pretraining and specialized architectures, we demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs can be adapted to this task with minimal task-specific data. We evaluate twelve model variations across five prominent open LLM families using zero, one, few, and many-shot prompting to assess performance across scenarios. Our experimental study identifies the top-performing model through extensive experimentation of in-context learning-related parameters, which we fine-tune to further enhance task performance. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in recognizing citation intents, providing valuable insights for model selection and prompt engineering. Additionally, we make our end-to-end evaluation framework and models openly available for future use.</description>

      <title>New paper-by-paper classification for Scopus based on references reclassified by the origin of the papers citing them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reference-based classification system for individual Scopus publications is presented which takes into account the categories of the papers citing those references instead of the journals in which those cited papers are published. It supports multiple assignments of up to 5 categories within the Scopus ASJC structure, but eliminates the Multidisciplinary Area and the miscellaneous categories, and it allows for the reclassification of a greater number of publications (potentially 100%) than traditional reference-based systems. Twelve variants of the system were obtained by adjusting different parameters, which were applied to the more than 3.2 million citable papers from the active Scientific Journals in 2020 indexed in Scopus. The results were analyzed and compared with other classification systems such as the original journal-based Scopus ASJC, the 2-generation-reference based M3-AWC-0.8 (\'Alvarez-Llorente et al., 2024), and the corresponding authors' assignment based AAC (\'Alvarez-Llorente et al., 2023). The different variants obtained of the classification give results that improve those used as references in multiple scientometric fields. The variation called U1-F-0.8 seems especially promising due to its restraint in assigning multiple categories, consistency with reference classifications and the fact of applying normalization processes to avoid the overinfluence of articles that have a greater number of references.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate and revise text with human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this question, we present an unbiased, large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010--2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This excess word analysis suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, reaching 30% for some sub-corpora. We show that LLMs have had an unprecedented impact on the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>From Code to Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The web-based dynamic geometry software CindyJS is a versatile tool to create interactive applications for mathematics and other topics. In this workshop, we will look at a code package that makes the creation of animations in CindyJS easier and more streamlined. Animations, which can then be embedded into presentations or be used in (lecture) videos. The focus lies on the creation of the animations themselves and some of the technical and artistic fundamentals to do so.</description>
