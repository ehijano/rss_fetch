      <title>Super-Eddington accretion onto black holes and its application to fallback accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of steady-state spherical accretion onto a black hole, in which the internal energy of the flow is governed by radiation and photon diffusion dominates the energy flux at large radii. In the free-fall limit, the fluid equations can admit two types of solutions for a given accretion rate: (1) accretion flows that become isothermal at large radii and (2) solutions in which the temperature at infinity vanishes as a power law of the radius. Using boundary layer theory, we obtain analytic solutions for the two cases and apply our results to fallback accretion onto a black hole following a failed supernova explosion. We give predictions for the observational signature of fallback accretion using realistic progenitor properties from MESA, both for a fully ionized inflow and for the more realistic case in which recombination/ionization take place due to low photospheric temperatures. The observed fading sources coincident with the failed-supernova candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are too luminous to be powered by spherical accretion onto newly formed black holes; the observed sources are instead likely due to accretion of the turbulent, convective envelope of the supergiant progenitor.</description>

      <title>Variable X-ray reverberation in the rapidly accreting AGN Ark 564: the response of the soft excess to the changing geometry of the inner accretion flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray reverberation, which exploits the time delays between variability in different energy bands as a function of Fourier frequency, probes the structure of the inner accretion disks and X-ray coronae of active galactic nuclei. We present a systematic X-ray spectroscopic and reverberation study of the high-Eddington-ratio narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 564, using over 900 ks of \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} observations spanning 13 years. The time-averaged spectra can be well described by the a model consisting of a coronal continuum, relativistic disk reflection, warm Comptonization, and three warm absorbers. Leveraging the high X-ray brightness of Ark 564, we are able to resolve the time evolution of the spectra and contemporaneous reverberation lags. The soft-band lag relative to the continuum increases with the X-ray flux, while Fe K$\alpha$ lags are detected in only a subset of epochs and do not correlate with soft lags. Models based on a lamppost corona and reflection from a standard thin disk can broadly reproduce the observed lag-energy spectra of low-flux epochs; however, additional reverberation from the warm Comptonized atmosphere is required to explain the soft lags observed in high-flux epochs. A vertically puffed-up inner disk and a variable, vertically extended corona can better explain the observed evolution of the lags and covariance spectra. Our study underscores the importance of multi-epoch, multi-band analyses for a comprehensive understanding the inner accretion disk and corona.</description>

      <title>Convection signatures in early-time gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted from core-collapse supernova explosions are critical observables for extracting information about the dynamics and properties of both the progenitor and the post-bounce~evolution of the system. They are prime targets for current interferometric searches and represent a key milestone for the capabilities of next-generation interferometers.
  This study aims to characterize how the gravitational waveform associated with prompt stellar convection depends on the rotational rate and magnetic field topology of the progenitor star.
  We carry out a series of axisymmetric simulations of a $16.5\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ red supergiant with five configurations of initial magnetic fields and varying degrees of initial rotation. We then analyze the contribution of early-time convection and the proto-neutron star core to the waveform using ensemble empirical mode decomposition, alongside spectral and Fourier analyses, to facilitate comparison and interpretation of the results.
  Our simulations reveal that early post-bounce gravitational waves signals are dominated by the first six intrinsic mode functions, with variations due to rotation and magnetic fields influencing the signal strength. Strong magnetic fields decelerate core rotation, affecting mode excitation. Regardless of the initial rotation, convection consistently drives a low-frequency mode that lasts throughout the evolution. Additionally, our results show that the bounce signal is not consistently the strongest component of the waveform. Instead, we find that prompt convection generates a post-bounce signal of comparable or even greater amplitude.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Properties of the Fallback Rate from Tidal Disruption Events: Investigating the Maximum Gravity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A star destroyed by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a tidal disruption event (TDE) gives rise to a luminous flare. TDEs are being detected at an ever-increasing rate, motivating the need for accurate models of their lightcurves. The ``maximum gravity'' (MG) model posits that a star is completely destroyed when the tidal field of the SMBH exceeds the maximum self-gravitational field within the star, $g_{\rm max}$, and predicts the peak fallback rate $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ and the time to peak $t_{\rm peak}$. Here we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the complete disruption of 24 stars with masses ranging from $0.2-5.0 M_\odot$, at different stages of their main sequence evolution, to test the predictions of this model. We find excellent agreement between the MG model predictions and our simulations for stars near the zero-age main sequence, while the predictions are less accurate (but still within $\sim 35-50\%$ of the simulation results) for highly evolved stars. We also generalize the MG model to incorporate the Paczy{\'n}ski-Wiita potential to assess the impact of strong-gravity effects -- which are especially important for deep encounters that are required to completely destroy evolved and centrally concentrated stars -- and find good agreement with recent works that include relativistic gravity. Our results demonstrate that this model provides accurate constraints on the peak timescale of TDE lightcurves and their correlation with black hole mass.</description>

      <title>Polarisation as a probe of neutrino emission from blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source of extragalactic neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range is a matter of very active research, with blazar jets having been postulated to be the origin of at least some of the detections. The blazar PKS 0735+178 is a prominent example; during its multi-band flare in late 2021 a neutrino event was reported by four observatories, with its origin consistent with the direction of that source. While no new jet component was observed to be ejected during that narrow time-frame, our analysis shows that a propagating shock front originating from the core region was the likely source of the multi-band flare, using very-long-baseline interferometry images of PKS 0735+178 in polarised light. Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation. The necessary conditions for neutrino emission via proton-photon interactions are, hence, present in this jet.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the neutron component of extensive air showers with the Surface-Scintillator Detectors of AugerPrime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrons are the only neutral hadrons that remain stable over the timescale of an air-shower development. Their energy is lost only through hadronic interactions and quasi-elastic scattering, which results in their high abundance at the ground. The signals from the electromagnetic and muonic components in scintillation detectors typically span only a few microseconds. In contrast, the neutrons can cause delayed pulses in scintillation detectors up to and beyond several milliseconds after the passage of the shower front. Selection of an appropriate time window allows us to isolate and characterize the neutron component of air showers, which may provide a new, direct method to probe hadronic interactions during the shower development. We report the measurement of a neutron component at ultra-high energies using the Surface-Scintillator Detectors (SSD) from the AugerPrime upgrade of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We provide a first look at the pulse-amplitude spectrum together with our measured rate and lateral distribution of the neutron component.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 146.8 s pulsations from EP J005146.9-730930, a new transient Be/X-ray binary in the SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with Einstein Probe (EP) revealed a new transient X-ray source, most likely identified as Be/X-ray binary. To characterise the X-ray properties of EP J005146.9-730930 and in particular to look for pulsations in the X-ray flux, we triggered an XMM-Newton anticipated target of opportunity observation. To follow the flux evolution during the outburst we monitored the source for about three months with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope of EP. The XMM-Newton observation was performed on 2024 September 15 and we used the data from the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) for detailed spectral and timing analyses. The EPIC X-ray spectrum is well described by an absorbed power law with photon index of 1.25 +/- 0.04 and the timing analysis revealed pulsations with 146.79 +\- 0.03 s. The source flux had decreased by a factor of about 10 since the observed maximum about one month before the XMM-Newton observation. EP J005146.9-730930 was never detected significantly during serendipitous observations before September 2024. The characteristics of the X-ray brightening suggest the source was discovered during a type II outburst reaching an X-ray peak luminosity of ~2 x 10^37 erg/s. The trend of spectral hardening towards higher luminosities observed by EP suggests that the source is accreting below the critical luminosity, yielding an estimated lower limit for the pulsar magnetic field strength of 3.3 x 10^12 G. The improved X-ray position confirms the candidate Be star OGLE J005147.58-730924.7 as optical counterpart. We conclude that EP J005146.9-730930 = SXP 146.8 is a new Be/X-ray binary pulsar in the SMC.</description>

      <title>Observation of Astrophysical Sources with SST-1M Telescopes -- First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small Size Cherenkov Telescope (SST-1M) was developed by a consortium of institutes in Switzerland, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The SST-1M design is based on the Davies-Cotton concept, featuring a 4-meter mirror and an innovative SiPM-based camera. It is most sensitive to gamma rays in the TeV and multi-TeV energy bands. Since 2022, two SST-1M prototypes have been commissioned at the Ondrejov Observatory in the Czech Republic, where their performance in both mono and stereo observation modes is being tested. During the commissioning phase, several galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray sources have been observed, resulting in multiple detections. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from this observation campaign.</description>

      <title>Ordinary Stars as Potential TeV Cosmic-Ray Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17461v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of cosmic rays increasingly point to the existence of nearby sources - so-called "local tevatrons", capable of accelerating particles to TeV energies. In this study, we examine the potential of a typical main-sequence star, represented by the Sun, to act as a source of TeV cosmic rays (CRs). We focus on identifying plausible mechanisms through which a quiescent star can accelerate charged particles to relativistic energies. We show that shock-drift acceleration processes operating within the chromospheres of the Sun and similar stars can accelerate particles to energies reaching the TeV scale. Additionally, we provide quantitative estimates of both the maximum achievable particle energies, spectral index of energy spectrum and the resulting cosmic-ray fluxes that such stellar environments could realistically produce. Our results indicate that ordinary stars could potentially contribute to the fine structure observed in the cosmic-ray spectrum at TeV energies and may help explain the local excess of TeV-scale electrons and positrons detected by H.E.S.S. and other observatories.</description>

      <title>Early Identification of Optical Tidal Disruption Events: A science module for the Fink broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of tidal disruption events (TDEs) is one of the key science goals of large optical time-domain surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. However, identifying TDEs in the vast alert streams produced by these surveys requires automated and reliable classification pipelines that can select promising candidates in real time. We developed a module within the Fink alert broker to identify TDEs during their rising phase. It was built to autonomously operate within the ZTF alert stream, producing a list of candidates every night and enabling spectral and multi-wavelength follow-up near peak brightness. All rising alerts are submitted to selection cuts and feature extraction using the Rainbow multi-band lightcurve fit. Best-fit values were used as input to train an XGBoost classifier with the goal of identifying TDEs. The training set was constructed using ZTF observations for objects with available classification in the Transient Name Server. Finally, candidates with high enough probability were visually inspected. The classifier achieves 76% recall, indicating strong performance in early-phase identification, despite the limited available information before peak. We show that, out of the known TDEs that pass the selection cuts, half of them are flagged as TDE before halfway in their rise, proving the feasibility of early classification. Additionally, new candidates were identified by applying the classifier on archival data, including a likely repeated TDE and some potential TDEs occurring in active galaxies. The module is implemented into the Fink alert processing framework, reporting each night a small number of candidates to dedicated communication channels through a user-friendly interface, for manual vetting and potential follow-up.</description>

      <title>GW231123: a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We analyze GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH mass and spin distributions to test possible formation scenarios: first-generation stellar collapse, hierarchical (multi-generation) mergers, and primordial origin. Our analysis strongly prefers scenarios where at least one component is a higher-generation BH. Both components are favored to have high spins, which rules out scenarios in which they are both first-generation (low spin) or primordial (nearly non-spin). We conclude that GW231123 is a hierarchical merger, with components plausibly originate from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical fraction in the disks of active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology Estimation Tool in Gammapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17622v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An understanding of the energy dependence of gamma-ray sources can yield important information on the underlying emission mechanisms. However, despite the detection of energy-dependent morphologies in many TeV sources, we lack a proper quantification of such measurements. We introduce an estimation tool within the Gammapy landscape, an open-source Python package for the analysis of gamma-ray data, to quantify the energy-dependent morphology of a gamma-ray source. The proposed method for this estimation tool fits the spatial morphology in a global fit across all energy slices (null hypothesis) and compares this to separate fits for each energy slice (alternative hypothesis). These are modelled using forward-folding methods, and the significance of variability is quantified by comparing the test statistic between the two hypotheses. We present a general tool to probe changes in the spatial morphology with energy, employing a full forward folding approach with 3D likelihood. We present its usage on a real dataset from H.E.S.S., and also on a simulated dataset to quantify the significance of energy dependence for sources of different sizes. In the first example, which utilises a subset of data from HESSJ1825-137, we observe extended emission at lower energies that becomes more compact at higher energies. The tool indicates very significant variability (9.8{\sigma}) in the case of the largely extended emission. In the second example, a source with a smaller extent (~0.1{\deg}), simulated using the CTAO response, shows the tool can still provide a statistically significant variation (9.7{\sigma}), despite the small scale.</description>

      <title>A deep search for radio pulsations from the 1.3 M$_{\odot}$ compact-object binary companion of young pulsar PSR J1906+0746</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double pulsar systems offer unrivaled advantages for the study of both astrophysics and fundamental physics. But only one has been visible: PSR J0737$-$3039; and its component pulsar B has now rotated out of sight due to the general-relativistic effect of geodetic precession. We know, though, that these precession cycles can also pivot pulsars into sight, and that this precession occurs at similar strength in PSR J1906+0746. That source is a young, unrecycled radio pulsar, orbiting a compact object with mass $\sim $1.32 M$_{\odot}$. This work presents a renewed campaign to detect radio pulsations from this companion, two decades after the previous search. Two key reasons driving this reattempt are the possibility that the companion radio beam has since precessed into our line of sight, and the improved sensitivity now offered by the FAST radio telescope. In 28 deep observations, we did not detect a credible companion pulsar signal. After comparing the possible scenarios, we conclude the companion is still most likely a pulsar that is not pointing at us. We next present estimates for the sky covered by such systems throughout their precession cycle. We find that for most system geometries, the all-time beaming fraction is unity, i.e., observers in any direction can see the system at some point. We conclude it is still likely that PSR J1906+0746 will be visible as a double pulsar in the future.</description>

      <title>A narrowband burst from FRB 20190520B simultaneously observed by FAST and Parkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short-duration radio transients with mysterious origins. Since its uncertainty, there are very few FRBs that are observed by different instruments, simultaneously. This study presents a detailed analysis of a burst from FRB 20190520B observed by FAST and Parkes at the same time. The spectrum of this individual burst ended at the upper limit of the FAST frequency band and was simultaneously detected by the Parkes telescope in the 1.5-1.8 GHz range. By employing spectral energy distribution (SED) and spectral sharpness methods, we confirmed the presence of narrowband radiation in FRB 20190520B, which is crucial for understanding its radiation mechanisms. Our findings support the narrowband characteristics that most repeaters exhibit. This work also highlights the necessity of continued multiband observations to explore its periodicity and frequency-dependent properties, contributing to an in-depth understanding of FRB phenomena.</description>

      <title>Do Multi-Structural One-Off FRBs Trace Similar Cosmology History with Repeaters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration transient events that are typically observed at radio wavelengths and cosmological distances but their origin remains unclear. Furthermore, most FRB origin models are related to the processes at stellar scales, involving neutron stars, blackholes, supernovae, etc. In this paper, our purpose is to determine whether multi-structural one-off FRBs and repeaters share similarities. To achieve this, we focus on analyzing the relationship between the FRB event rate and the star formation rate, complemented by statistical testing methods. Based on the CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calculate the energy functions for four subsamples, including apparent non-repeating FRBs (one-offs), repeaters, multi-structural one-offs, and the joint repeaters and multi-structural events, respectively. We then derive the FRB event rates at different redshifts for all four subsamples, all of which were found to share a similar cosmological evolution trend. However, we find that the multi-structural one-offs and repeaters are distinguishable from the KS and MWW tests.</description>

      <title>Dancing in the dark: probing Dark Matter through the dynamics of eccentric binary pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of eccentric binary pulsars embedded in dark matter environments. While previous studies have primarily focused on circular orbits in collisionless dark matter halos, we extend this framework to eccentric systems and explore their interaction with ultralight scalar fields. Adopting a perturbative approach, we compute the modifications to the orbital period induced by dark matter-driven dynamical friction. Our results show that orbital eccentricity amplifies the imprints of non-vacuum environments on binary dynamics, underscoring the potential of such systems as sensitive probes for dark matter signatures.</description>

      <title>Premature Ignition: Why the Single-Degenerate Channel Leads to Type Iax and Not Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are pivotal for the origins of the elements, the understanding of galactic chemical evolution, and serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators, yet their progenitor systems remain a central enigma in astrophysics. While both the growth of white dwarfs to near-Chandrasekhar mass and their explosion (the single-degenerate; SD) and mergers of two WDs leading to explosions (double-degenerate; DD) scenarios have been proposed, neither explains the observed diversity of thermonuclear transients and their properties, including the fainter Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax). Here we show, through comprehensive three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, that as accreting WDs grow towards the Chandrasekhar mass (the SD channel), premature carbon ignition at sub-Chandrasekhar densities can trigger partial deflagrations that eject substantial mass in low-energy Iax outbursts. Such a process effectively serves as a self-limiting feedback loop, which stalls further mass growth. It naturally explains why the SD channel is precluded from producing standard, normal SNe Ia, and instead predominantly yields SNe Iax. Our findings significantly reframe the SD versus DD debate, with important implications for supernova rates, galactic chemical enrichment, and cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling of Landau Damping with Deep Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Implications of modern mass-loss rates for massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through stellar winds at various stages of their lives, including on the main sequence, during the red supergiant phase, and as evolved helium-rich Wolf--Rayet stars. In stellar population synthesis, uncertainty in the mass-loss rates in these evolutionary stages limits our understanding of the formation of black holes and merging compact binaries. In the last decade, the theoretical predictions, simulation, and direct observation of wind mass-loss rates in massive stars have improved significantly, typically leading to a reduction in the predicted mass-loss rates of massive stars. In this paper we explore the astrophysical implications of an updated treatment of winds in the COMPAS population synthesis code. There is a large amount of variation in predicted mass-loss rates for massive red supergiants; some of the prescriptions we implement predict that massive red supergiants are able to lose their hydrogen envelopes through winds alone (providing a possible solution to the so-called missing red supergiant problem), while others predict much lower mass-loss rates that would not strip the hydrogen envelope. We discuss the formation of the most massive stellar-mass black holes in the Galaxy, including the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 and the newly discovered Gaia BH3. We find that formation rates of merging binary black holes are sensitive to the mass-loss rate prescriptions, while the formation rates of merging binary neutron stars and neutron-star black hole binaries are more robust to this uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.</description>

      <title>Innovative Approaches to Unravel the Shower Components' Energy Spectrum with a Single Hybrid Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately measuring the energy of shower particles reaching the ground remains a challenge due to the inherent limitations of typical cosmic ray experiments. In this work, we present two experimental strategies to determine the energy spectra of the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers, leveraging a single hybrid detector station within a regular cosmic ray array. This station consists of a scintillator surface detector (SSD), a water Cherenkov detector (WCD), and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), with a prototype currently being tested at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
  The first approach exploits the different responses of each detector to the same particles traversing them, allowing, for the first time, the extraction of the high-energy tail of the electromagnetic spectrum and the low-energy tail of the muonic spectrum. The second strategy utilizes machine learning tools to reconstruct the direction of muons using the WCD+RPC system. By correlating this information with the reconstructed muon production depth, the muon kinematical delay can be analyzed, providing access to its energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Implications of the recent neutron decay measurements on the properties of compact objects -- a dark star with nucleonic shell ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental observation suggests that neutron decay is always accompanied by emission of electron while in 1% of cases proton is not emitted. We develop a scenario kinematically compatible with experimental observation, where neutron decay results in production of two dark matter particles of about half the mass of neutron and test properties of neutron stars with admixture of such particles. Constraints on mass and coupling to vector dark boson are obtained. The structure of the compact object is modified to a dark star with a shell of nucleonic matter around the nuclear saturation density.</description>

      <title>Learning from ASTRI-Horn: products and applications of Variance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the ASTRI MiniArray project (9 dual-mirror air Cherenkov telescopes being installed at the Observatorio del Teide in the Canary Islands), the ASTRI- Horn prototype was previously implemented in Italy (Sicily). It was a crucial test bench for establishing observation strategies, hardware upgrades, and software solutions. Specifically, during the winter 2022/2023 observing campaign, we implemented significant enhancements in using the so-called Variance mode, an auxiliary output of the ASTRI Cherenkov camera able to take images of the night sky background in the near UV/visible band. Variance data are now processed online and on site using a dedicated pipeline and stored in tech files. This data can infer possible telescope mis-pointing, background level, number of identified stars, and point spread function. In this contribution, we briefly present these quantities and their importance together with the algorithms adopted for their calculation. They provide valuable monitoring of telescope health and sky conditions during scientific data collection, enabling the selection of optimal time sequences for Cherenkov data reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal Dark Matter is among the simplest and most predictive Dark Matter frameworks, with the Majorana SU(2) 5-plet as its smallest accidentally stable real representation. We present a comprehensive reassessment of its indirect-detection signals. The $\gamma$-ray flux from both Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilations and bound-state formation is calculated, incorporating next-to-leading-order corrections and next-to-leading-log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects. In the Milky Way halo, bound-state formation dominates the flux near 100 GeV. The corresponding low-energy spectrum is used to place constraints based on Fermi-LAT observations of Galactic diffuse emission, while the high-energy part of the spectrum is employed to forecast the required observation time for several of the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). Fermi-LAT data strongly disfavor the lower edge of the thermal mass window, even under conservative assumptions about the inner Galaxy density profile. Furthermore, several hundred hours of forthcoming CTAO observations of northern dwarfs should be sufficient to probe the central mass value.</description>

Abstract: Recent analyses on the properties of the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PSR J1231-1411 pulsar indicated that these two compact objects are characterized by similar (low) masses and possibly different radii. This paper aims at reconciling the aforementioned measurements by utilizing the widely employed color-flavor locked (CFL) MIT bag model. The main objective is related to the examination of the acceptable values for the color superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the bag parameter $B$. Furthermore, our analysis involves two distinct hypotheses for the nature of compact stars. Firstly, we considered the case of absolute stability for strange quark matter and we found that it is possible to explain both measurements, while also respecting the latest astronomical constraints on the masses and radii of compact stars. Secondly, we studied the case of hybrid stellar matter (transition from hadrons to quarks), and concluded that, when early phase transitions are considered, the simultaneous reconciliation of both measurements leads to results that are inconsistent to the existence of massive compact stars. However, we showed that all current constraints may be satisfied under the consideration that the HESS J1731-347 remnant contains a slow stable hybrid star.</description>

Abstract: We performed deep X-ray observations of the Virgo cluster using the Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (EP-FXT) with a total exposure of 295 ks. Leveraging the large field of view (FoV) and low particle background of EP-FXT, the image reveals a giant spiral feature connecting the cold fronts in the northwest and southeast, forming a coherent structure consistent with earlier results from XMM-Newton and Suzaku. We also present two-dimensional maps of temperature, metallicity, and entropy across the Virgo Cluster, covering a FoV of approximately 28.5 arcmin. These maps clearly show a spiral structure with high density, low temperature, high metallicity, and low entropy. The results support a scenario where the spiral morphology arises from gas sloshing driven by a minor merger. Additionally, EP-FXT temperature measurements agree well with XMM-Newton data within uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: The hybrid detection approach in astroparticle physics has been successfully employed in cosmic-ray experiments and is currently being explored by gamma-ray observatories like LHAASO. We present a study on the hybrid detection concept for the future Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), integrating multiple Cherenkov telescopes represented in the analysis by Single-Mirror Small-Size imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (SST-1M) located next to the surface array of water Cherenkov detectors (WCDs). We discuss the mutual benefits of this hybrid approach and present simulation-based results on key performances. Our findings points to the fact that the combination of wide field-of-view and continuous operation of WCDs with the high angular and energy resolution of Cherenkov telescopes could significantly improve the overall detection capabilities of the SWGO experiment.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dispersion measure redshift relation with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the dispersion measure (DM) of localised Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to constrain cosmological and host galaxy parameters using simulation-based inference (SBI) for the first time. By simulating the large-scale structure of the electron density with the Generator for Large-Scale Structure (GLASS), we generate log-normal realisations of the free electron density field, accurately capturing the correlations between different FRBs. For the host galaxy contribution, we rigorously test various models, including log-normal, truncated Gaussian and Gamma distributions, while modelling the Milky Way component using pulsar data. Through these simulations, we employ the truncated sequential neural posterior estimation method to obtain the posterior. Using current observational data, we successfully recover the amplitude of the DM-redshift relation, consistent with Planck, while also fitting both the mean host contribution and its shape. Notably, we find no clear preference for a specific model of the host galaxy contribution. Although SBI may not yet be strictly necessary for FRB inference, this work lays the groundwork for the future, as the increasing volume of FRB data will demand precise modelling of both the host and large-scale structure components. Our modular simulation pipeline offers flexibility, allowing for easy integration of improved models as they become available, ensuring scalability and adaptability for upcoming analyses using FRBs. The pipeline is made publicly available under https://github.com/koustav-konar/FastNeuralBurst.</description>

      <title>Phase consistency test to identify type II strongly lensed gravitational wave signals using a single event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For gravitationally lensed type II signals, the phase of the dominant (2, 2) mode and the higher order (3, 3) mode is offset by $-\pi/12$, or roughly -0.26 radians. Using this, we develop a test for type II imagery by allowing the phases of the (2,2) and (3,3) modes to vary separately and introducing a new waveform parameter to represent the phase offset between the two. We use simulated, asymmetric mass ratio, precessing signals to show that the test can reproduce the $-\pi/12$ phase offset when detected by three detectors for H-L optimal SNR $\gtrsim$ 40 and $\mathcal{M} \leq 30$. We analyze GW190412 and GW190814 using this parameterization, measuring the offset to be $0.13^{+0.22}_{-0.17}$ for GW190412 and $-0.05^{+0.20}_{-0.22}$ for GW190814. We also measure the Bayes factor in support of zero phase offset, $\log_{10} \mathcal{B}_{\Delta \varphi = 0}$, to be $-0.14$ for GW190412 and $0.21$ for GW190814. This implies our results are not strong enough to confidently argue if either event is a type II image, and is consistent with our statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>The response of warm absorbers to the variations in the ionizing continuum in the active galaxy NGC 4051</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis of the warm absorbers in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051, which has an active galactic nucleus (AGN), using observations from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Despite NICER's moderate spectral resolution, its high-cadence monitoring allows us to probe the response of the ionized outflows, also known as warm absorbers, on timescales of approximately 5500 seconds. We detect two distinct components of ionized absorbers in this source. The ionization parameter of the low-ionization warm absorber component tracks changes in the ionizing flux with no measurable time lag. This rapid response implies photoionization equilibrium and places a lower limit on the electron density of about 9 x 10^6 cm^-3, based on the most abundant ionic species, O VII. The absorber is located within approximately 0.02 parsecs of the central source, consistent with an origin in the inner regions of the active nucleus. In contrast, the high-ionization absorber remains consistently under-ionized relative to equilibrium predictions. This suggests that it may be collisional plasma, as also indicated in previous studies. These results demonstrate that time-resolved spectroscopy, even with moderate-resolution instruments, can provide valuable constraints on the density and location of warm absorbers in AGN. As a potential contributor to AGN feedback, the study of these ionized outflows is crucial to understanding AGN--host galaxy interactions.</description>

      <title>Properties of compact objects in quadratic non-metricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations, which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that, in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative quantum chromodynamics.</description>
