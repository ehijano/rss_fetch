      <title>Neural Hamiltonian Deformation Fields for Dynamic Scene Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing and rendering dynamic scenes with complex motions remains challenging in computer vision and graphics. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods achieve high-quality rendering but often produce physically implausible motions. We introduce NeHaD, a neural deformation field for dynamic Gaussian Splatting governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. Our key observation is that existing methods using MLPs to predict deformation fields introduce inevitable biases, resulting in unnatural dynamics. By incorporating physics priors, we achieve robust and realistic dynamic scene rendering. Hamiltonian mechanics provides an ideal framework for modeling Gaussian deformation fields due to their shared phase-space structure, where primitives evolve along energy-conserving trajectories. We employ Hamiltonian neural networks to implicitly learn underlying physical laws governing deformation. Meanwhile, we introduce Boltzmann equilibrium decomposition, an energy-aware mechanism that adaptively separates static and dynamic Gaussians based on their spatial-temporal energy states for flexible rendering. To handle real-world dissipation, we employ second-order symplectic integration and local rigidity regularization as physics-informed constraints for robust dynamics modeling. Additionally, we extend NeHaD to adaptive streaming through scale-aware mipmapping and progressive optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeHaD achieves physically plausible results with a rendering quality-efficiency trade-off. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration leveraging Hamiltonian mechanics for neural Gaussian deformation, enabling physically realistic dynamic scene rendering with streaming capabilities.</description>

      <title>DeMapGS: Simultaneous Mesh Deformation and Surface Attribute Mapping via Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DeMapGS, a structured Gaussian Splatting framework that jointly optimizes deformable surfaces and surface-attached 2D Gaussian splats. By anchoring splats to a deformable template mesh, our method overcomes topological inconsistencies and enhances editing flexibility, addressing limitations of prior Gaussian Splatting methods that treat points independently. The unified representation in our method supports extraction of high-fidelity diffuse, normal, and displacement maps, enabling the reconstructed mesh to inherit the photorealistic rendering quality of Gaussian Splatting. To support robust optimization, we introduce a gradient diffusion strategy that propagates supervision across the surface, along with an alternating 2D/3D rendering scheme to handle concave regions. Experiments demonstrate that DeMapGS achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction quality and enables downstream applications for Gaussian splats such as editing and cross-object manipulation through a shared parametric surface.</description>

      <title>What matters for Representation Alignment: Global Information or Spatial Structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation alignment (REPA) guides generative training by distilling representations from a strong, pretrained vision encoder to intermediate diffusion features. We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \textit{global} \revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $&lt;$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

      <title>RectifiedHR: High-Resolution Diffusion via Energy Profiling and Adaptive Guidance Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis with diffusion models often suffers from energy instabilities and guidance artifacts that degrade visual quality. We analyze the latent energy landscape during sampling and propose adaptive classifier-free guidance (CFG) schedules that maintain stable energy trajectories. Our approach introduces energy-aware scheduling strategies that modulate guidance strength over time, achieving superior stability scores (0.9998) and consistency metrics (0.9873) compared to fixed-guidance approaches. We demonstrate that DPM++ 2M with linear-decreasing CFG scheduling yields optimal performance, providing sharper, more faithful images while reducing artifacts. Our energy profiling framework serves as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding and improving diffusion model behavior.</description>

      <title>SpotLight: Shadow-Guided Object Relighting via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can serve as powerful neural rendering engines that can be leveraged for inserting virtual objects into images. However, unlike typical physics-based renderers, these neural rendering engines are limited by the lack of manual control over the lighting, which is often essential for improving or personalizing the desired image outcome. In this paper, we show that precise and controllable lighting can be achieved without any additional training, simply by supplying a coarse shadow hint for the object. Indeed, we show that injecting only the desired shadow of the object into a pre-trained diffusion-based neural renderer enables it to accurately shade the object according to the desired light position, while properly harmonizing the object (and its shadow) within the target background image. Our method, SpotLight, is entirely training-free and leverages existing neural rendering approaches to achieve controllable relighting. We show that SpotLight achieves superior object compositing results, both quantitatively and perceptually, as confirmed by a user study, outperforming existing diffusion-based models specifically designed for relighting. We also demonstrate other applications, such as hand-scribbling shadows and full-image relighting, demonstrating its versatility.</description>

      <title>ShapeWords: Guiding Text-to-Image Synthesis with 3D Shape-Aware Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce ShapeWords, an approach for synthesizing images based on 3D shape guidance and text prompts. ShapeWords incorporates target 3D shape information within specialized tokens embedded together with the input text, effectively blending 3D shape awareness with textual context to guide the image synthesis process. Unlike conventional shape guidance methods that rely on depth maps restricted to fixed viewpoints and often overlook full 3D structure or textual context, ShapeWords generates diverse yet consistent images that reflect both the target shape's geometry and the textual description. Experimental results show that ShapeWords produces images that are more text-compliant, aesthetically plausible, while also maintaining 3D shape awareness.</description>

      <title>MaskedManipulator: Versatile Whole-Body Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenges of synthesizing versatile, physically simulated human motions for full-body object manipulation. Unlike prior methods that are focused on detailed motion tracking, trajectory following, or teleoperation, our framework enables users to specify versatile high-level objectives such as target object poses or body poses. To achieve this, we introduce MaskedManipulator, a generative control policy distilled from a tracking controller trained on large-scale human motion capture data. This two-stage learning process allows the system to perform complex interaction behaviors, while providing intuitive user control over both character and object motions. MaskedManipulator produces goal-directed manipulation behaviors that expand the scope of interactive animation systems beyond task-specific solutions.</description>
