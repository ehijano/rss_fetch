      <title>Capturing Finite Target Dynamics: Phase-Delayed Analytic Modeling of Multi-Layer Penetration Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Walker-Anderson half-space penetration model has been successfully used for the rapid, efficient calculation of penetration of walls by rigid and eroding rods. These models align well with detailed simulations for thick targets; however, existing extensions for finite targets struggle to accurately capture nose-tail velocity profiles in thinner targets. For stack-ups of thin-walled targets, this deficiency results in mischaracterized rod-erosion relative to hydrocode or experimental predictions. In this work, we leverage insights from detailed hydro-code simulations to propose an updated modification to the Walker-Anderson model to correctly account for wave propagation within a given target. This addition improves results for thin targets while retaining good behavior for thick targets with zero additional model parameters. Our updated model exhibits strong agreement with detailed simulations for targets with multiple thin walls.</description>

      <title>Optimal Geometric Design of Thermoelectric Metamaterials for Enhancing Power Generation: An Interpretative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric metamaterials featuring width modulation through constrictions (constricted geometries) have emerged as a promising approach for improving heat management and thermoelectric performance. Through a combination of theoretical calculations, analytical formalism, and validation against experimental data, it is shown that thermoelectric performance in such geometries is governed by two fundamental mechanisms of pure geometrical origin: (i) a characteristic scaling behavior of resistance with Transmissivity, and (ii) the critical formation of the Constriction Thermal Resistance. Hourglass-shaped thermoelectric legs - identified as optimal in recent experiments - are found to exhibit the same underlying transport mechanisms observed in other constricted profiles, including single and multiple sharp constrictions. The commonly used Geometric Parameter is found to be insufficient for capturing the full influence of geometry on transport, whereas Transmissivity serves as a robust descriptor of constricted geometry, independent of material choice or device operating conditions. A universal scaling formalism is derived linking electrical and thermal resistances, along with key thermoelectric performance metrics, to the Transmissivity. A unified optimization framework is also developed for composite legs, incorporating both constricted material and contact electrodes. This framework indicates that previously reported performance gains may be largely attributed to contact resistance, rather than geometry alone. Transmissivity is established as a key geometric descriptor, enabling generalized design principles and global optimization criteria for enhancing thermoelectric power generation. This analysis elucidates new avenues in the design of thermoelectric metamaterials for efficient energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Low Power, Scalable Nanofabrication via Photon Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoscale fabrication, which enables precise construction of intricate three-dimensional structures, is of foundational importance for advancing innovation in plasmonics, nanophotonics, and biomedical applications. However, scaling fabrication to industrially relevant levels remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate that triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) offers a unique opportunity to increase fabrication speeds and scalability of micro- and nanoscale 3D structures. Due to its nonlinearity and low power requirements, TTA-UC enables localized polymerization with nanoscale resolutions while simultaneously printing millions of voxels per second through optical parallelization using off-the-shelf light-emitting diodes and digital micromirror devices. Our system design and component integration empower fabrication with a minimum lateral feature size down to 230 nm and speeds up to 112 million voxels per second at a power of 7.0 nW per voxel. This combination of high resolution and fast print speed demonstrates that TTA-UC is a significant advancement in nanofabrication technique, evidenced by the fabrication of hydrophobic nanostructures on a square-centimeter scale, paving the way for industrial nanomanufacturing.</description>

      <title>Bridging Grain Mapping and Dark Field X-ray Microscopy for Multiscale Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolving how defects emerge and interact within the hierarchical structure of polycrystalline materials remains a core challenge in materials science. Grain-mapping methods such as three-dimensional X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) and diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) provide essential mesoscale context but lack the resolution to image lattice defects. Conversely, high-resolution methods like Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) capture lattice distortions but not the surrounding microstructure. Here, we introduce a transferable framework that unifies these complementary approaches into a single, non-destructive workflow. Enabled by open-source software, the method translates grain orientation and position data into precise goniometer settings for DFXM imaging without dismounting or reorienting the sample. Applied to an iron polycrystal containing 1100 grains, DFXM motor positions were calculated for all grains within seconds, enabling on-the-fly targeting of specific grains. This allows reproducible zooming from the millimetre-scale aggregate to individual dislocations. We resolve three-dimensional misorientation fields across grain boundaries with 36 nm pixel size, directly capturing grain-grain interactions within their microstructural context. Finally, we show transferability from LabDCT to synchrotron and XFEL platforms, enabling new ways of studying defect interactions across scales.</description>

      <title>Achieving broadband directivity control with dual corona discharge transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loudspeakers inherit their directivity from their geometry and dimensions. Enclosed loudspeakers are omnidirectional in the low frequency range, but their directivity depends on frequency for wavelengths smaller than the radiator size, precluding the directional control over the whole bandwidth. Loudspeakers pairs allow achieving simultaneously monopolar (in-phase) and dipolar (out-of-phase) sources, thus allowing directivity control. However, they are limited by their bulkiness, preventing extending controllable directivities over high frequencies.
  The Corona Discharge transducer (CDT) concept relies on ionizing an ultra-thin layer of air and oscillating it through an alternating electric field, generating sound without resorting to a mechanical membrane. This transducer combines a monopolar source linked to heat exchanges, and a dipolar linked to electrostatic forces, although these two sources strengths are interconnected, yielding a given unidirectional directivity.
  In this paper, we propose to leverage the combination of monopole and dipole at the heart of the CDT concept to achieve controllable directivities by stacking two independent CDTs. The very thin dimensions of the CDT allows achieving coincident controllable monopolar and dipolar sound sources making the control of directivity over the whole operating frequency range. An analytical model of the dual CDTs concept is first compared to full-wave simulations, and an experimental prototype is finally assessed in anechoic conditions. Our findings opens the way to a new range of broadband directionally-controllable transducers that have application to sound generation, active noise reduction, or even non-reciprocal active acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shear cell tests have been conducted on twenty different lactose powders, most of which commercially available for oral or inhalation purposes, spanning a wide range of particle sizes, particle morphologies, production processes. The aims of the investigation were: i) to verify the reliability of the technique in evaluating and classifying the flowability of powders; ii) to understand the connection between the flowability of a powder and the morphological properties of its particles; iii) to find a general mathematical relationship able to predict the yield locus shape given the particle size, shape and consolidation state of a lactose powder. These aspects and their limitations are detailed in the manuscript together with other interesting findings on the stick-slip behavior observed in most of the lactose powders examined.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Control in RIS-Aided Wireless Communications: A Predictive Physics-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) into wireless communication systems is a promising approach for enhancing coverage and data rates by intelligently redirecting signals, through a process known as beamforming. However, the process of RIS beamforming (or passive beamforming) control is associated with multiple latency-inducing factors. As a result, by the time the beamforming is effectively updated, the channel conditions may have already changed. For example, the low update rate of localization systems becomes a critical limitation, as a mobile UE's position may change significantly between two consecutive measurements. To address this issue, this work proposes a practical and scalable physics-based solution that is effective across a wide range of UE movement models. Specifically, we propose a kinematic observer and predictor to enable proactive RIS control. From low-rate position estimates provided by a localizer, the kinematic observer infers the UE's speed and acceleration. These motion parameters are then used by a predictor to estimate the UE's future positions at a higher rate, allowing the RIS to adjust promptly and compensate for inherent delays in both the RIS control and localization systems. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating real-time RIS adjustments with low computational complexity, even in scenarios involving rapid UE movement.</description>

      <title>Exponentiation and decomposition formulas for common operators 1: Classical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this tutorial, exponentiation and factorization (decomposition) formulas are derived and discussed for common matrix operators that arise in studies of classical dynamics, linear and nonlinear optics, and special relativity. To understand the physical properties of systems of common interest, one first needs to understand the mathematical properties of the symplectic group Sp(2), the special unitary groups SU(2) and SU(1,1), and the special orthogonal groups SO(3) and SO(1,2). For these groups, every matrix can be written as the exponential of a generating matrix, which is a linear combination of three fundamental matrices (generators). For Sp(2), SU(1,1) and SO(1,2), every matrix also has a Schmidt decomposition, in which it is written as the product of three simpler matrices. The relations between the entries of the matrix, the generator coefficients and, where appropriate, the Schmidt-decomposition parameters are described in detail. It is shown that Sp(2) is isomorphic to (has the same structure as) SU(1,1) and SO(1,2), and SU(2) is isomorphic to SO(3). Several examples of these isomorphisms (relations between Schmidt decompositions and product rules) are described, which illustrate their usefulness (complicated results can be anticipated or derived easily). This tutorial is written at a level that is suitable for senior undergraduate students and junior graduate students.</description>

      <title>Design of broadband optical gain in GaSb-based waveguide amplifiers with asymmetric quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A design strategy for achieving broadband optical gain in GaSb-based semiconductor amplifiers operating beyond 2 \mu m is presented. By employing asymmetric GaInSb/AlGaAsSb quantum wells (QWs) of varying thicknesses, a flat and wide gain spectrum is demonstrated. The approach leverages carrier density and transition energy tuning across QWs to access various energy levels at specific current densities. Simulations using "Harold" self-consistent environment predict a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) gain bandwidth exceeding 340 nm for a structure comprising one 7 nm and three 13 nm-thick QWs. The modelling parameters were validated against experimental data, ensuring a robust framework for designing broadband amplifiers and superluminescent diodes for mid-infrared applications.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-driven Ultrafast and Highly Efficient Saturable Absorption for Ultrashort Pulse Generation Based on 2D V2C</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmon-driven ultrafast nonlinearities hold promise for advanced photonics but remain challenging to harness in two-dimensional materials at telecommunication wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate few-layer V2C MXene as a high-performance saturable absorber by leveraging its tailored surface plasmon resonance. Combining transient absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we unveil a plasmon-driven relaxation mechanism dominated by interfacial high-energy hot electron generation (~100 fs), enabling giant ultrafast nonlinearities. Crucially, at the communication band (1550 nm), V2C exhibits a high saturable absorption coefficient of -1.35 cm/GW. Integrating this into an erbium-doped fiber laser, we generate mode-locked pulses with a duration of 486 fs at 1569 nm, a 39.51 MHz repetition rate, and exceptional stability (92 dB SNR). This work establishes plasmonic MXenes as a paradigm for tailored ultrafast photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Under-Sampling Effect for AI-based Dynamic Gravimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometer (AI)-based dynamic gravimeter enable high-precision absolute gravity measurements, crucial for applications in geophysics, navigation, resource exploration, and metrology. Understanding their underlying mechanisms and minimizing measurement noise are essential for enhancing performance. This work investigates the gravity measurement noise in AI-based systems induced by the under-sampling time of the classical accelerometer. Using actual dynamic gravity measurement data, we demonstrate that an under-sampling time of 0.12 s introduces significant gravity measurement noise of 8 mGal. To elucidate the mechanism of this noise, we derive a formula for this noise in frequency domain, identifying high-frequency aliasing as its source. Analysis of the derived expressions indicates that reducing the under-sampling time duration and suppressing the high-frequency noise of the acceleration are effective strategies for mitigating this noise. This work provides significant insights for noise analysis and future scheme design of AI-based dynamic gravimeters.</description>

Abstract: Single photon sources are fundamental for applications in quantum computing, secure communication, and sensing, as they enable the generation of individual photons and ensure strict control over photon number statistics. However, current single photon sources can be limited by a lack of robustness, difficulty of integration into existing optical or electronic devices, and high cost. In this study, we present the use of off-the-shelf \ch{C60} fullerene molecules embedded in polystyrene as room-temperature reliable single-photon emitters. As our results demonstrate, these molecules exhibit on-demand single-photon emission, with short fluorescence lifetimes and, consequently, high emission rates. The wide availability and ease of preparation and manipulation of fullerenes as single photon sources can pave the way for the development of practical, economic and scalable quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimization of superconducting properties of F-doped SmFeAsO by cubic anvil high-pressure technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We optimize the synthesis conditions for SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 (Sm1111) bulks using a cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) apparatus through both ex-situ and in-situ processes, applying pressures of up to 4 GPa and heating temperatures of up to 1600{\deg}C. A comprehensive characterization has been performed, including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1400 {\deg}C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111 phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP, persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized conditions (1400 {\deg}C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-to-Crystalline Phase Transition between Germanium Selenide Polymorphs with High Resistance Contrast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding phase transitions between crystalline phases of a material is crucial for both fundamental research and potential applications such as phase-change memory. In this study, we investigate the phase transition between GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by either global annealing at moderate temperatures or localized laser-induced heating. The highly conductive gamma-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline alpha-GeSe while preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. The distinct structural and electronic properties at the gamma-GeSe/alpha-GeSe interface were investigated by transmission electron microscopy analysis. We propose that the clustering of Ge vacancies in the gamma-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures is a key mechanism driving the transition, leading to the formation of alpha-GeSe through the segregation of a minor GeSe2 phase. Furthermore, we observe a high electrical resistance contrast of approximately 10^7 between gamma-GeSe and alpha-GeSe, underscoring the potential of GeSe as a model polymorphic system for electronic applications, including phase-change memory.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional hyperspectral imaging with optical microcombs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs have revolutionised time and frequency metrology [1, 2]. The advent of microresonator-based frequency combs ('microcombs' [3-5]) is set to lead to the miniaturisation of devices that are ideally suited to a wide range of applications, including microwave generation [6, 7], ranging [8-10], the precise calibration of astronomical spectrographs [11], neuromorphic computing [12, 13], high-bandwidth data communications[14], and quantum-optics [15, 16] platforms. Here, we introduce a new microcomb application for three-dimensional imaging. Our method can simultaneously determine the chemical identity and full three-dimensional geometry, including size, shape, depth, and spatial coordinates, of particulate matter ranging from micrometres to millimetres in size across nearly $10^5$ distinct image pixels. We demonstrate our technique using millimetre-sized plastic specimens (i.e. microplastics measuring less than 5 mm). We combine amplitude and phase analysis and achieve a throughput exceeding $1.2~10^6$ pixels per second with micrometre-scale precision. Our method leverages the defining feature of microcombs - their large line spacing - to enable precise spectral diagnostics using microcombs with a repetition frequency of 1 THz. Our results suggest scalable operation over several million pixels and nanometre-scale axial resolution. Coupled with its high-speed, label-free and multiplexed capabilities, our approach provides a promising basis for environmental sensing, particularly for the real-time detection and characterisation of microplastic pollutants in aquatic ecosystems [17].</description>

      <title>Acoustic Holography in the Megahertz Frequency Range with Optimal Lens Topologies and Nonlinear Acoustic Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic holography in the megahertz frequency range can impact numerous applications, including manufacturing, non-destructive testing, and transcranial ultrasound. However, designing lens topologies for complex acoustic holograms in the megahertz range poses a significant challenge, as weave propagation effects through the lens cannot be ignored. Here, we show that the inherent ability of heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to incorporate in plane varying speed-of-sound maps and support rapid differentiable optimization of lens thickness profiles can generate lens topologies for high fidelity acoustic holography. Crucially, we show that this framework can also account for wavefront aberrations in the propagation media, providing the opportunity to reconfigure this disruptive technology for high precision neuro-interventions. Our investigations also revealed that low frequency acoustic feedback generated by nonlinear mixing of high frequency waves allows attaining accurate skull-compensating lens alignment and creates the possibility to monitor CSF fluid build-up and removal in hydrocephalus. Together, our findings support the design of simple, economical, and high-performance ultrasound systems.</description>

      <title>Negative Spin $\Delta_T$ noise Induced by Spin-Flip Scattering and Andreev Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14072v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge $\Delta_T$ noise, followed by an examination of spin $\Delta_T$ noise, in the normal metal-spin flipper-normal metal-insulator-superconductor (N-sf-N-I-S) junction. Our analysis reveals a key contrast: while charge $\Delta_T$ noise remains strictly positive, spin $\Delta_T$ noise undergoes a sign reversal from positive to negative, driven by the interplay between spin-flip scattering as well as Andreev reflection. In contrast, charge quantum shot noise remains positive and sign-definite, which is valid for spin quantum shot noise also. The emergence of negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise has two major implications. First, it establishes a clear distinction between spin resolved $\Delta_T$ noise and quantum shot noise: the former is dominated by opposite-spin correlations, whereas the latter is led by same-spin correlations. Second, it provides access to scattering mechanisms that are not captured by quantum shot noise alone. Thus, negative spin $\Delta_T$ noise serves as a unique probe of the cooperative effects of Andreev reflection and spin flipping. We further place our results in context by comparing them with earlier reports of negative $\Delta_T$ noise in strongly correlated systems, such as fractional quantum Hall states, and in multiterminal hybrid superconducting junctions. Overall, this work offers new insights into the mechanisms governing sign reversals in $\Delta_T$ noise and highlights their role as distinctive fingerprints of spin-dependent scattering in superconducting hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Guided Surface Lattice Resonances in Index-Discontinuous Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in metasurfaces have become a transformative platform for subwavelength optical devices, leveraging their high quality (Q)-factors, pronounced local field enhancement, and extensive long-range interactions. However, current high-Q SLR implementations are fundamentally limited by their dependence on homogeneous dielectric environments. This restriction significantly hinders their applicability in emerging fields such as molecular sensing, where operation in heterogeneous dielectric media (e.g., interfaces with an aqueous or air cladding) is often indispensable. To overcome this limitation, we introduce guided surface lattice resonances (gSLRs) by integrating nanoparticle arrays within slab waveguides. This configuration facilitates efficient coupling between scattered light and Bloch modes, thereby enabling high-Q multimodal resonances even in index-discontinuous environments. Experimental validation under incoherent illumination demonstrates a Q-factor of 1489 in an index-mismatched surrounding. Furthermore, the coupling strength and resonance intensity of these multimodal gSLRs can be continuously modulated by adjusting the vertical displacement of the nanoparticle arrays within the slab layers. To augment the sensitivity to local dielectric variations, we investigate gSLRs in metasurfaces integrated with metallic substrates, demonstrating suitability for biomolecule detection. A mathematical sensing model, incorporating biochemical reaction kinetics and optical responses, is established by representing adsorbed molecules as a uniform dielectric layer and validated through bovine serum albumin (BSA) sensing experiments. This work not only advances the fundamental understanding of resonance engineering in complex media but also facilitates the development of ultrathin, ultra-compact nano-optical and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cross-linking of MXenes: Tunable Interfaces and Chemiresistive Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter-flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize MXenes in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to tune precisely the interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. The dominating charge transport mechanism is variable range hopping (VRH) in accordance with the structure analysis of the films. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing in MXene composites, observing pronounced water sensitivity and selectivity, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into molecular cross-linking and its impact on charge transport open avenues for next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity electro-optic modulation for advanced pulse-comb synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavity electro-optic (EO) modulation plays a pivotal role in optical pulse and frequency comb synthesis, supporting a wide range of applications including communication, computing, ranging, and quantum information. The ever-growing demand for these applications has driven efforts in enhancing modulation coupling strength and bandwidth towards advanced pulse-comb synthesis. However, the effects of strong-coupling and high-bandwidth cavity EO modulation remain underexplored, due to the lack of a general, unified model that captures this extreme condition. In this work, we present a universal framework for pulse-comb synthesis under cavity EO modulation, where coupling strength and modulation bandwidth far exceed the cavity's free spectral range (FSR). We show that, under such intense and ultrafast driving conditions, EO-driven frequency combs and pulses exhibit rich higher-order nonlinear dynamics, including temporal pulse compression and comb generation with arbitrary pump detuning. Leveraging this framework, we reveal a direct link between the higher-order dynamics of EO pulse-comb generation and the band structure of synthetic dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate arbitrary comb shaping via machine-learning-based inverse microwave drive design, achieving a tenfold enhancement in cavity electro-optic comb flatness by exploring the synergistic effects of high-bandwidth driving and detuning-induced frequency boundaries. Our findings push cavity electro-optic modulation into a new frontier, unlocking significant potential for universal and machine-learning-programmable electro-optic frequency combs, topological photonics, as well as photonic quantum computing in the strong-coupling and high-bandwidth regimes.</description>

      <title>Topologically Protected Polaritonic Bound State in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as powerful tools for realizing ultra-high-Q resonances in nanophotonics. While previous implementations have primarily relied on dielectric metasurfaces, they remain limited by the diffraction limit. In this work, we theoretically and numerically demonstrate and experimentally validate the existence of topologically protected phonon-polaritonic BICs in periodic arrays of cylindrical nanoresonators composed of isotopically enriched hexagonal boron nitride (h11BN), which have the availability of two restrahlen bands (lower (type-I) and upper (type II)), operating in the lower Reststrahlen band (RB-1). Owing to the uniaxial anisotropy of hBN and the rotational symmetry of the structure, these systems support topologically symmetry-protected BICs at the {\Gamma}-point, where radiative losses are fully suppressed. The total quality factor is ultimately bounded by the intrinsic phonon damping of h11BN, enabling high-Q polaritonic modes with minimal radiation leakage. When cylindrical symmetry is broken via angular tilting of incident light away from the normal incidence, these BICs transition into quasi-BICs (q-BICs) with strong field confinement and tunable radiation leakage. This topological protection enables robust control over mode lifetimes and confinement, paving the way toward scalable polaritonic platforms for mid-infrared optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum nanophotonics.</description>
