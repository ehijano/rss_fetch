      <title>Channel Estimation and Beamforming for Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a new advance and generalization of the RIS technique. BD-RIS breaks through the isolation between RIS elements by creatively introducing inter-element connections, thereby enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarging coverage. However, exploring proper channel estimation schemes suitable for BD-RIS aided communication systems still remains an open problem. In this paper, we study channel estimation and beamforming design for BD-RIS aided multi-antenna systems. We first describe the channel estimation strategy based on the least square (LS) method, derive the mean square error (MSE) of the LS estimation, and formulate the joint pilot sequence and BD-RIS design problem with unique constraints induced by BD-RIS architectures. Specifically, we propose an efficient pilot sequence and BD-RIS design which theoretically guarantees to achieve the minimum MSE. With the estimated channel, we then consider two BD-RIS scenarios and propose beamforming design algorithms. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and beamforming design algorithms. We also show that more interelement connections in BD-RIS improves the performance while increasing the training overhead for channel estimation.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Analysis of the Multipath Propagation Model Parameters for Power Line Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fitting procedure that aims to identify the statistical properties of the parameters that describe the most widely known multipath propagation model (MPM) used in power line communication (PLC). Firstly, the MPM parameters are computed by fitting the theoretical model to a large database of single-input-single-output (SISO) experimental measurements, carried out in typical home premises. Secondly, the determined parameters are substituted back into the MPM formulation with the aim to prove their faithfulness, thus validating the proposed computation procedure. Then, the MPM parameters properties have been evaluated. In particular, the statistical behavior is established identifying the best fitting distribution by comparing the most common distributions through the use of the likelihood function. Moreover, the relationship among the different paths is highlighted in terms of statistical correlation. The identified statistical behavior for the MPM parameters confirms the assumptions of the previous works that, however, were mostly established in an heuristic way.</description>

      <title>UAV Corridor Coverage Analysis with Base Station Antenna Uptilt and Strongest Signal Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) corridors are sky lanes where UAVs fly through safely between their origin and destination. To ensure the successful operation of UAV corridors, beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) wireless connectivity within the corridor is crucial. One promising solution to support this is the use of cellular-connected UAV (C-UAV) networks, which offer long-range and seamless wireless coverage. However, conventional terrestrial base stations (BSs) that typically employ down-tilted sector antennas to serve ground users are not ideally suited to serve the aerial vehicles positioned above the BSs. In our previous work, we focused on studying the optimal uptilt angle of BS antennas to maximize the wireless coverage probability in UAV corridors. However, the association of BSs with UAVs was restricted to the nearest BS association, which limits the potential coverage benefits. In this paper, we address this limitation by considering the strongest BS signal association in UAV corridors, which enables enhanced coverage within the corridor compared to the nearest BS association. The strongest BS association allows UAVs to connect with the second nearest BSs while also accounting for interference from the third nearest BSs. Closed-form expression analysis and simulation results show that the strongest BSs association in UAV corridors yields a superior coverage probability when compared to the nearest BS association.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Synchronous Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends various theoretical results from stationary data processing to cyclostationary (CS) processes under a unified framework. We first derive their asymptotic eigenbasis, which provides a link between their Fourier and Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions, through a unitary transformation dictated by the cyclic spectrum. By exploiting this connection and the optimalities offered by the KL representation, we study the asymptotic performance of smoothing, filtering and prediction of CS processes, without the need for deriving explicit implementations. We obtain minimum mean squared error expressions that depend on the cyclic spectrum and include classical limits based on the power spectral density as particular cases. We conclude this work by applying the results to a practical scenario, in order to quantify the achievable gains of synchronous signal processing.</description>

      <title>RLC resonator with diode nonlinearity: Bifurcation comparison of numerical predictions and circuit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear RLC resonator is investigated experimentally and numerically using bifurcation analysis. The nonlinearity is due to the parallel combination of a semiconductor rectifier diode and a fixed capacitor. The diode's junction capacitance, diffusion capacitance, and DC current-voltage relation each contribute to the nonlinearity. The closely related RL-diode resonator has been of interest for many years since its demonstration of period-doubling cascades to chaos. In this study a direct comparison is made of dynamical regime maps produced from simulations and circuit measurements. The maps show the variety of limit cycles, their bifurcations, and regions of chaos over the 2-d parameter space of the source voltage's frequency and amplitude. The similar structures of the simulated and experimental maps suggests that the diode models commonly used in circuit simulators (e.g., SPICE) work well in bifurcation analyses, successfully predicting complex and chaotic dynamics detected in the circuit. These results may be useful for applications of varactor-loaded split ring resonators.</description>

      <title>Interpretable cancer cell detection with phonon microscopy using multi-task conditional neural networks for inter-batch calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show great potential in revealing underlying information from phonon microscopy (high-frequency ultrasound) data to identify cancerous cells. However, this technology suffers from the 'batch effect' that comes from unavoidable technical variations between each experiment, creating confounding variables that the AI model may inadvertently learn. We therefore present a multi-task conditional neural network framework to simultaneously achieve inter-batch calibration, by removing confounding variables, and accurate cell classification of time-resolved phonon-derived signals. We validate our approach by training and validating on different experimental batches, achieving a balanced precision of 89.22% and an average cross-validated precision of 89.07% for classifying background, healthy and cancerous regions. Classification can be performed in 0.5 seconds with only simple prior batch information required for multiple batch corrections. Further, we extend our model to reconstruct denoised signals, enabling physical interpretation of salient features indicating disease state including sound velocity, sound attenuation and cell-adhesion to substrate.</description>

      <title>R2D2 image reconstruction with model uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging'' (R2D2) approach was recently introduced for Radio-Interferometric (RI) imaging in astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the R2D2 image estimation process, by studying the uncertainty associated with its series of learned models. Adopting an ensemble averaging approach, multiple series can be trained, arising from different random DNN initializations of the training process at each iteration. The resulting multiple R2D2 instances can also be leveraged to generate ``R2D2 samples'', from which empirical mean and standard deviation endow the algorithm with a joint estimation and uncertainty quantification functionality. Focusing on RI imaging, and adopting a telescope-specific approach, multiple R2D2 instances were trained to encompass the most general observation setting of the Very Large Array (VLA). Simulations and real-data experiments confirm that: (i) R2D2's image estimation capability is superior to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms; (ii) its ultra-fast reconstruction capability (arising from series with only few DNNs) makes the computation of multiple reconstruction samples and of uncertainty maps practical even at large image dimension; (iii) it is characterized by a very low model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Adaptive TTD Configurations for Near-Field Communications: An Unsupervised Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: True-time delayers (TTDs) are popular analog devices for facilitating near-field wideband beamforming subject to the spatial-wideband effect. In this paper, an adaptive TTD configuration is proposed for short-range TTDs. Compared to the existing TTD configurations, the proposed one can effectively combat the spatial-widebandd effect for arbitrary user locations and array shapes with the aid of a switch network. A novel end-to-end deep neural network is proposed to optimize the hybrid beamforming with adaptive TTDs for maximizing spectral efficiency. 1) First, based on the U-Net architecture, a near-field channel learning module (NFC-LM) is proposed for adaptive beamformer design through extracting the latent channel response features of various users across different frequencies. In the NFC-LM, an improved cross attention (CA) is introduced to further optimize beamformer design by enhancing the latent feature connection between near-field channel and different beamformers. 2) Second, a switch multi-user transformer (S-MT) is proposed to adaptively control the connection between TTDs and phase shifters (PSs). In the S-MT, an improved multi-head attention, namely multi-user attention (MSA), is introduced to optimize the switch network through exploring the latent channel relations among various users. 3) Third, a multi feature cross attention (MCA) is introduced to simultaneously optimize the NFC-LM and S-MT by enhancing the latent feature correlation between beamformers and switch network. Numerical simulation results show that 1) the proposed adaptive TTD configuration effectively eliminates the spatial-wideband effect under uniform linear array (ULA) and uniform circular array (UCA) architectures, and 2) the proposed deep neural network can provide near optimal spectral efficiency, and solve the multi-user bemformer design and dynamical connection problem in real-time.</description>

      <title>GeNet: A Graph Neural Network-based Anti-noise Task-Oriented Semantic Communication Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic communication tasks rely on the knowledge of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to mitigate channel noise. However, these methods necessitate training under specific SNR conditions, entailing considerable time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose GeNet, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based paradigm for semantic communication aimed at combating noise, thereby facilitating Task-Oriented Communication (TOC). We propose a novel approach where we first transform the input data image into graph structures. Then we leverage a GNN-based encoder to extract semantic information from the source data. This extracted semantic information is then transmitted through the channel. At the receiver's end, a GNN-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct the relevant semantic information from the source data for TOC. Through experimental evaluation, we show GeNet's effectiveness in anti-noise TOC while decoupling the SNR dependency. We further evaluate GeNet's performance by varying the number of nodes, revealing its versatility as a new paradigm for semantic communication. Additionally, we show GeNet's robustness to geometric transformations by testing it with different rotation angles, without resorting to data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Optimization for SIM-Based Holographic MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of emerging stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-based holographic MIMO (HMIMO) systems, a fundamental problem is to study the mutual information (MI) between transmitted and received signals to establish their capacity. However, direct optimization or analytical evaluation of the MI, particularly for discrete signaling, is often intractable. To address this challenge, we adopt the channel cutoff rate (CR) as an alternative optimization metric for the MI maximization. In this regard, we propose an alternating projected gradient method (APGM), which optimizes the CR of a SIM-based HMIMO system by adjusting signal precoding and the phase shifts across the transmit and receive SIMs in a layer-by-layer basis. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the CR, achieving substantial gains proportional to those observed for the corresponding MI. This justifies the effectiveness of using the channel CR for the MI optimization. Moreover, we demonstrate that the integration of digital precoding, even on a modest scale, has a significant impact on the ultimate performance of SIM-aided systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is an effective data representation tool with numerous applications in signal processing and machine learning. However, deploying NMF in a decentralized manner over ad-hoc networks introduces privacy concerns due to the conventional approach of sharing raw data among network agents. To address this, we propose a privacy-preserving algorithm for fully-distributed NMF that decomposes a distributed large data matrix into left and right matrix factors while safeguarding each agent's local data privacy. It facilitates collaborative estimation of the left matrix factor among agents and enables them to estimate their respective right factors without exposing raw data. To ensure data privacy, we secure information exchanges between neighboring agents utilizing the Paillier cryptosystem, a probabilistic asymmetric algorithm for public-key cryptography that allows computations on encrypted data without decryption. Simulation results conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in achieving privacy-preserving distributed NMF over ad-hoc networks.</description>

      <title>Stragglers-Aware Low-Latency Synchronous Federated Learning via Layer-Wise Model Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative edge learning. It typically involves a set of heterogeneous devices locally training neural network (NN) models in parallel with periodic centralized aggregations. As some of the devices may have limited computational resources and varying availability, FL latency is highly sensitive to stragglers. Conventional approaches discard incomplete intra-model updates done by stragglers, alter the amount of local workload and architecture, or resort to asynchronous settings; which all affect the trained model performance under tight training latency constraints. In this work, we propose straggler-aware layer-wise federated learning (SALF) that leverages the optimization procedure of NNs via backpropagation to update the global model in a layer-wise fashion. SALF allows stragglers to synchronously convey partial gradients, having each layer of the global model be updated independently with a different contributing set of users. We provide a theoretical analysis, establishing convergence guarantees for the global model under mild assumptions on the distribution of the participating devices, revealing that SALF converges at the same asymptotic rate as FL with no timing limitations. This insight is matched with empirical observations, demonstrating the performance gains of SALF compared to alternative mechanisms mitigating the device heterogeneity gap in FL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity in the brain-computer interface field can be alleviated through the use of generative models, specifically diffusion models. While diffusion models have previously been successfully applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) data, existing models lack flexibility w.r.t.~sampling or require alternative representations of the EEG data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach to conditional diffusion models that utilizes classifier-free guidance to directly generate subject-, session-, and class-specific EEG data. In addition to commonly used metrics, domain-specific metrics are employed to evaluate the specificity of the generated samples. The results indicate that the proposed model can generate EEG data that resembles real data for each subject, session, and class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a distributed algorithm, termed noise-robust distributed maximum consensus (RD-MC), for estimating the maximum value within a multi-agent network in the presence of noisy communication links. Our approach entails redefining the maximum consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem, allowing a solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Unlike existing algorithms that rely on multiple sets of noise-corrupted estimates, RD-MC employs a single set, enhancing both robustness and efficiency. To further mitigate the effects of link noise and improve robustness, we apply moving averaging to the local estimates. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that RD-MC is significantly more robust to communication link noise compared to existing maximum-consensus algorithms.</description>

      <title>Spikewhisper: Temporal Spike Backdoor Attacks on Federated Neuromorphic Learning over Low-power Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated neuromorphic learning (FedNL) leverages event-driven spiking neural networks and federated learning frameworks to effectively execute intelligent analysis tasks over amounts of distributed low-power devices but also perform vulnerability to poisoning attacks. The threat of backdoor attacks on traditional deep neural networks typically comes from time-invariant data. However, in FedNL, unknown threats may be hidden in time-varying spike signals. In this paper, we start to explore a novel vulnerability of FedNL-based systems with the concept of time division multiplexing, termed Spikewhisper, which allows attackers to evade detection as much as possible, as multiple malicious clients can imperceptibly poison with different triggers at different timeslices. In particular, the stealthiness of Spikewhisper is derived from the time-domain divisibility of global triggers, in which each malicious client pastes only one local trigger to a certain timeslice in the neuromorphic sample, and also the polarity and motion of each local trigger can be configured by attackers. Extensive experiments based on two different neuromorphic datasets demonstrate that the attack success rate of Spikewispher is higher than the temporally centralized attacks. Besides, it is validated that the effect of Spikewispher is sensitive to the trigger duration.</description>

Abstract: Communication-sensing integration represents an up-and-coming area of research, enabling wireless networks to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. However, in urban cellular networks, the blockage of buildings results in a complex signal propagation environment, affecting the performance analysis of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. To overcome this obstacle, this paper constructs a comprehensive framework considering building blockage and employs a distance-correlated blockage model to analyze interference from line of sight (LoS), non-line of sight (NLoS), and target reflection cascading (TRC) links. Using stochastic geometric theory, expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and coverage probability for communication and sensing in the presence of blockage are derived, allowing for a comprehensive comparison under the same parameters. The research findings indicate that blockage can positively impact coverage, especially in enhancing communication performance. The analysis also suggests that there exists an optimal base station (BS) density when blockage is of the same order of magnitude as the BS density, maximizing communication or sensing coverage probability.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Spatial-Temporal Channel Statistics from Indoor Measurement Data at D Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and D Band (110--170~GHz) frequencies are poised to play a pivotal role in the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) systems and beyond, owing to their ability to enhance performance metrics such as capacity, ultra-low latency, and spectral efficiency. This paper concentrates on deriving statistical insights into power, delay, and the number of paths based on measurements conducted across four distinct locations at a center frequency of 143.1 GHz. The findings underscore the suitability of various distributions in characterizing power behavior in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, including lognormal, Nakagami, gamma, and beta distributions, whereas the loglogistic distribution gives the optimal fit for power distribution in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Moreover, the exponential distribution shows to be the most appropriate model for the delay distribution in both LOS and NLOS scenarios. In terms of the number of paths, observations indicate a tendency for the highest concentration within the 10 m to 30 m distance range between the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). These insights shed light on the statistical nature of D band propagation characteristics, which are vital for informing the design and optimization of future 6G communication systems</description>

      <title>HOOD: Real-Time Human Presence and Out-of-Distribution Detection Using FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting human presence indoors with millimeter-wave frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar faces challenges from both moving and stationary clutter. This work proposes a robust and real-time capable human presence and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method using 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar. HOOD solves the human presence and OOD detection problems simultaneously in a single pipeline. Our solution relies on a reconstruction-based architecture and works with radar macro and micro range-Doppler images (RDIs). HOOD aims to accurately detect the presence of humans in the presence or absence of moving and stationary disturbers. Since HOOD is also an OOD detector, it aims to detect moving or stationary clutters as OOD in humans' absence and predicts the current scene's output as "no presence." HOOD performs well in diverse scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness across different human activities and situations. On our dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar, we achieve an average AUROC of 94.36%. Additionally, our extensive evaluations and experiments demonstrate that HOOD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) OOD detection methods in terms of common OOD detection metrics. Importantly, HOOD also perfectly fits on Raspberry Pi 3B+ with an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, which showcases its versatility across different hardware environments.

      <title>Enhancing Performance, Calibration Time and Efficiency in Brain-Machine Interfaces through Transfer Learning and Wearable EEG Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have emerged as a transformative force in assistive technologies, empowering individuals with motor impairments by enabling device control and facilitating functional recovery. However, the persistent challenge of inter-session variability poses a significant hurdle, requiring time-consuming calibration at every new use. Compounding this issue, the low comfort level of current devices further restricts their usage. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive solution that combines a tiny CNN-based Transfer Learning (TL) approach with a comfortable, wearable EEG headband. The novel wearable EEG device features soft dry electrodes placed on the headband and is capable of on-board processing. We acquire multiple sessions of motor-movement EEG data and achieve up to 96% inter-session accuracy using TL, greatly reducing the calibration time and improving usability. By executing the inference on the edge every 100ms, the system is estimated to achieve 30h of battery life. The comfortable BMI setup with tiny CNN and TL paves the way to future on-device continual learning, essential for tackling inter-session variability and improving usability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks has brought new opportunities for the development of localization-based services. High-accuracy positioning use cases and functionalities defined by the standards are drawing the interest of vertical industries. In the transition towards the deployment, this paper aims to provide an in-depth tutorial on 5G positioning, summarizing the evolutionary path that led to the standardization of cellular-based positioning, describing the localization elements in current and forthcoming releases of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, and the major research trends. By providing fundamental notions on wireless localization, comprehensive definitions of measurements and architectures, examples of algorithms, and details on simulation approaches, this paper is intended to represent an exhaustive guide for researchers and practitioners. Our approach aims to merge practical aspects of enabled use cases and related requirements with theoretical methodologies and fundamental bounds, allowing to understand the trade-off between system complexity and achievable, i.e., tangible, benefits of 5G positioning services. We analyze the performance of 3GPP Rel-16 positioning by standard-compliant simulations in realistic outdoor and indoor propagation environments, investigating the impact of the system configuration and the limitations to be resolved for delivering accurate positioning solutions.</description>

      <title>Towards 6G Digital Twin Channel Using Radio Environment Knowledge Pool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The digital twin channel (DTC) is crucial for 6G wireless autonomous networks as it replicates the wireless channel fading states in 6G air interface transmissions. It is well known that the physical environment influences channels. A key task for accurately twinning channels in complex 6G scenarios is establishing precise relationships between the environment and the channels. In this article, the radio environment knowledge pool (REKP) is proposed, with its core function being to construct and store as much knowledge between the environment and channels as possible. Firstly, the research progress related to DTC is summarized, and a comparative analysis of these achievements on key indicators in digital twin is conducted, proposing the challenges faced in knowledge construction. Secondly, instructions on how to construct and update REKP are given. Then, a typical case is presented to demonstrate the great potential of REKP in enabling DTC. Finally, how to utilize REKP to address open issues in the 6G wireless communication system is discussed, including enhancing performance, reducing costs, and keeping a trustworthy DTC.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Linear Decoupling of Users for Uplink Massive MU-MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (mMIMO) enables users with different requirements to get connected to the same base station (BS) on the same set of resources. In the uplink of Multiuser massive MIMO (MU-mMIMO), while such heterogeneous users are served, decoupling facilitates the use of user-specific detection schemes. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity linear decoupling scheme called Sequential Decoupler (SD), which aids in the parallel detection of each user's data stream. The proposed algorithm shows significant complexity reduction. Simulations reveal that the complexity of the proposed scheme is only 0.15% of the conventional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based decoupling and is about 47% of the pseudo-inverse based decoupling schemes when 80 users with two antennas each are served by the BS. Also, the proposed scheme is scalable when new users are added to the system and requires fewer operations than computing the decoupler all over again. Further numerical analyses indicate that the proposed scheme achieves significant complexity reduction without any degradation in performance and is a promising low-complex alternative to the existing decoupling schemes.</description>

      <title>Near-Field EM-Based Multistatic Radar Range Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radar targets are traditionally modelled as point target reflectors, even in the near-field region. Yet, for radar systems operating at high carrier frequencies and small distances, traditional radar propagation models do not accurately model the scatterer responses. In this paper, a novel electromagnetic-based model is thus developed for the multistatic radar detection of a rectangular plate reflector in the near-field region. This model is applied to an automotive scenario, in which a linear antenna array is spread out at the front of a vehicle, and performs a radar measurement of the distance to the back of the vehicle ahead. Based on the developed received signal model, the maximum likelihood estimator of the range is designed. By exploiting the near-field target model, this estimator is shown to provide a significant gain with respect to traditional range estimators. The impact of the system and scenario parameters, i.e. the carrier frequency, bandwidth and distance to the target, is furthermore evaluated. This analysis shows that the radar resolution in the near-field regime is improved at high carrier frequencies, while saturating to the traditional bandwidth-dependent resolution in the far-field region.</description>

      <title>In-Distribution and Out-of-Distribution Self-supervised ECG Representation Learning for Arrhythmia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the effectiveness of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for Electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia detection. We begin by conducting a novel analysis of the data distributions on three popular ECG-based arrhythmia datasets: PTB-XL, Chapman, and Ribeiro. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to quantitatively explore and characterize these distributions in the area. We then perform a comprehensive set of experiments using different augmentations and parameters to evaluate the effectiveness of various SSL methods, namely SimCRL, BYOL, and SwAV, for ECG representation learning, where we observe the best performance achieved by SwAV. Furthermore, our analysis shows that SSL methods achieve highly competitive results to those achieved by supervised state-of-the-art methods. To further assess the performance of these methods on both In-Distribution (ID) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) ECG data, we conduct cross-dataset training and testing experiments. Our comprehensive experiments show almost identical results when comparing ID and OOD schemes, indicating that SSL techniques can learn highly effective representations that generalize well across different OOD datasets. This finding can have major implications for ECG-based arrhythmia detection. Lastly, to further analyze our results, we perform detailed per-disease studies on the performance of the SSL methods on the three datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Static Target Detection and Power Allocation for Integrated Sensing and Communication in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a centralized cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) network for target detection. ISAC transmit access points serve the user equipments in the downlink and optionally steer a beam toward the target in a multi-static sensing framework. A maximum a posteriori ratio test detector is developed for target detection in the presence of clutter, so-called target-free signals. Additionally, sensing spectral efficiency (SE) is introduced as a key metric, capturing the impact of resource utilization in ISAC. A power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio while ensuring minimum communication requirements. Two ISAC configurations are studied: utilizing existing communication beams for sensing and using additional sensing beams. The proposed algorithm's efficiency is investigated in realistic and idealistic scenarios, corresponding to the presence and absence of the target-free channels, respectively. Despite performance degradation in the presence of target-free channels, the proposed algorithm outperforms the interference-unaware benchmark, leveraging clutter statistics. Comparisons with a fully communication-centric algorithm reveal superior performance in both cluttered and clutter-free environments. The incorporation of an extra sensing beam enhances detection performance for lower radar cross-section variances. Moreover, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated operation of sensing and communication compared to an orthogonal resource-sharing approach.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Phase Association with Travel Time Neural Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of regional seismicity from multi-station seismograms relies on the ability to associate arrival phases with their originating earthquakes. Deep-learning-based phase detection now detects small, high-rate arrivals from seismicity clouds, even at negative magnitudes. This new data could give important insight into earthquake dynamics, but it is presents a challenging association task. Existing techniques relying on coarsely approximated, fixed wave speed models fail in this unexplored dense regime where the complexity of unknown wave speed cannot be ignored. We introduce Harpa, a high-rate association framework built on deep generative modeling and neural fields. Harpa incorporates wave physics by using optimal transport to compare arrival sequences. It is thus robust to unknown wave speeds and estimates the wave speed model as a by-product of association. Experiments with realistic, complex synthetic models show that Harpa is the first seismic phase association framework which is accurate in the high-rate regime, paving the way for new avenues in exploratory Earth science and improved understanding of seismicity.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Data Consistency with Diffusion Purification for Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained traction as a powerful class of deep generative priors, excelling in a wide range of image restoration tasks due to their exceptional ability to model data distributions. To solve image restoration problems, many existing techniques achieve data consistency by incorporating additional likelihood gradient steps into the reverse sampling process of diffusion models. However, the additional gradient steps pose a challenge for real-world practical applications as they incur a large computational overhead, thereby increasing inference time. They also present additional difficulties when using accelerated diffusion model samplers, as the number of data consistency steps is limited by the number of reverse sampling steps. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based image restoration solver that addresses these issues by decoupling the reverse process from the data consistency steps. Our method involves alternating between a reconstruction phase to maintain data consistency and a refinement phase that enforces the prior via diffusion purification. Our approach demonstrates versatility, making it highly adaptable for efficient problem-solving in latent space. Additionally, it reduces the necessity for numerous sampling steps through the integration of consistency models. The efficacy of our approach is validated through comprehensive experiments across various image restoration tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R2D2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach for non-Cartesian magnetic resonance image reconstruction. While unrolled architectures provide robustness via data-consistency layers, embedding measurement operators in Deep Neural Network (DNN) can become impractical at large scale. Alternative Plug-and-Play (PnP) approaches, where the denoising DNNs are blind to the measurement setting, are not affected by this limitation and have also proven effective, but their highly iterative nature also affects scalability. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging (R2D2)" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively estimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and associated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation, considering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary results suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the necessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior reconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based approximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to PnP, while only requiring few iterations.</description>
