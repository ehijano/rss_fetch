      <title>Minimal branching and fusion morphogenesis approaches biological multi-objective optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological networks grow by elongation of filaments that can branch and fuse -- typical examples include fungal mycelium or slime mold. These networks must simultaneously perform multiple tasks such as transport, exploration, and robustness under finite resources. Yet, how such multi-task architectures emerge from local growth processes remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a minimal model of spatial network morphogenesis based solely on stochastic branching, fusion, and stopping, during elongation. Despite the absence of global optimization or feedback, the model generates a broad morphospace from tree-like, to loopy, as well as hybrid architectures. By quantifying multiple functional objectives, we show that (i) these synthetic structures occupy similar regions of performance space than evolved empirical fungal networks, and (ii) that their Pareto front of optimal trade-offs lies close to that of these same fungal networks. Our results show that biological architectures approaching multi-objective optimality can arise from simple local growth rules, and identify branching and fusion as fundamental ingredients shaping the architecture of living transport networks.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part II -- Network-level mechanisms and emergent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the phenomenological and microscopic models reviewed in Part I, this second part focuses on network-level mechanisms that generate emergent temperature response curves. We review deterministic models in which temperature modulates the kinetics of coupled biochemical reactions, as well as stochastic frameworks, such as Markov chains, that capture more complex multi-step processes. These approaches show how Arrhenius-like temperature dependence at the level of individual reactions is transformed into non-Arrhenius scaling, thermal limits, and temperature compensation at the system level. Together, network-level models provide a mechanistic bridge between empirical temperature response curves and the molecular organization of biological systems, giving us predictive insights into robustness, perturbations, and evolutionary constraints.</description>

      <title>Emergent togetherness in collaborative dance improvisation: neural and motor synchronization reveal a coupling-decoupling paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective improvisation in dance provides a rich natural laboratory for studying emergent coordination in coupled neuro-motor systems. Here, we investigate how training shapes spontaneous synchronization patterns in both movement and brain signals during collaborative performance. Using a dual-recording protocol integrating 3D motion capture and hyperscanning EEG, participants engaged in free, interaction-driven, and rule-based improvisation before and after a program of generative dance, grounded in cellular-automata. Motor behavior was modeled through a time-resolved {\alpha}-exponent derived from Movement Element Decomposition scaling between mean velocity and displacement, revealing fluctuations in energetic strategies and degrees of freedom. Synchronization events were quantified using Motif Synchronization (biomechanical data) and multilayer Time-Varying Graphs (neural data), enabling the detection of nontrivial lead-lag dependencies beyond zero-lag entrainment. Results indicate that training produced an intriguing dissociation: inter-brain synchronization increased, particularly within the frontal lobe, while interpersonal motor synchrony decreased. This opposite trend suggests that enhanced participatory sense-making fosters neural alignment while simultaneously expanding individual motor explorations, thereby reducing coupling in movement. Our findings position collaborative improvisation as a complex dynamical regime in which togetherness emerges not from identical motor outputs but from shared neural intentionality distributed across multilayer interaction networks, exemplifying the coupling-decoupling paradox, whereby increasing inter-brain synchrony supports the exploration of broader and mutually divergent motor trajectories. These results highlight the nonlinear nature of social coordination, offering new avenues for modeling creative joint action in human systems.</description>

      <title>Integrated strong reciprocity enables productive punishment and protective defection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation in large groups and one-shot interactions is often hindered by freeloading. Punishment can enforce cooperation, but it is usually regarded as wasteful because the costs of punishing offset its benefits. Here, we analyze an evolutionary game model that integrates upstream and downstream reciprocity with costly punishment: integrated strong reciprocity (ISR). We demonstrate that ISR admits a stable mixed equilibrium of ISR and unconditional defection (ALLD), and that costly punishment can become productive: When sufficiently efficient, it raises collective welfare above the no-punishment baseline. ALLD players persist as evolutionary shields, preventing invasion by unconditional cooperation (ALLC) or alternative conditional strategies (e.g., antisocial punishment). At the same time, the mixed equilibrium of ISR and ALLD remains robust under modest complexity costs that destabilize other symmetric cooperative systems.</description>

      <title>Stigmergic optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient navigation in swarms often relies on the emergence of decentralized approaches that minimize traversal time or energy. Stigmergy, where agents modify a shared environment that then modifies their behavior, is a classic mechanism that can encode this strategy. We develop a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport by casting it as a stochastic optimal control problem: agents (collectively) lay and (individually) follow trails while minimizing expected traversal time. Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails. While reminiscent of Fermat's principle, our results show how local, noisy agent+field interactions can give rise to geodesic trajectories in heterogeneous environments, without centralized coordination or global knowledge, relying instead on an embodied slow fast dynamical mechanism.</description>
