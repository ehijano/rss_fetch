      <title>Using quantile time series and historical simulation to forecast financial risk multiple steps ahead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for quantile-based, semi-parametric historical simulation estimation of multiple step ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) models is developed. The method is primarily based on employing the quantile loss function, analogous to how the quasi-likelihood is employed by standard historical simulation methods. The estimated quantile series is used to scale the returns data, then re-sampling is employed to estimate the forecast distribution one and multiple steps ahead, allowing tail risk forecasting. This allows different quantile levels ($\alpha$) to be chosen for estimation and forecasting. The method is extended to allow a measurement equation incorporating realized measures, thus including Realized GARCH and Realized CAViaR type models in the class of models it pertains to. The proposed method implicitly assumes, and is applicable to, any data or model where the relationship between VaR and ES in the conditional return distribution does not change over time. The finite sample properties of this method, and its comparison with existing historical simulation methods, are evaluated via a simulation study. A forecasting study, applied to 3 indices and 3 assets, assesses the relative accuracy of the 1% and 2.5% VaR and ES one-day-ahead and ten-day-ahead forecasting results for the proposed class of models compared to several competitors.</description>
