      <title>InN nanowire solar cells on Si with amorphous Si interlayer deposited by sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of InN nanowire solar cells deposited by RF sputtering with a bandgap energy of 1.78 eV. By adding an amorphous Si (a-Si) buffer to the n-InN/p-Si structure, we have improved the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices while maintaining their material quality. We have firstly optimized the deposition of Si on Si(100) by DC sputtering, obtaining an amorphous material with bandgap energy of 1.39 eV. Then we have studied the influence of the thickness of the a-Si buffer layer (0-25 nm) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of InN nanowires on Si (100) substrates. With the use of a 15-nm buffer, n-InN/a-Si/p-Si nanowire heterojunction solar cells exhibit a promising short-circuit current density of 17 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 0.37 V and fill factor of 35.5%, pointing to a power-conversion efficiency of 2.3% under 1-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination. These work demonstrated that the combination of in-situ sputtered a-Si, which could serve as potential passivation layer, and the light trapping enhancement by the nanostructured active layer leads to an improvement of the photovoltaic efficiency of sputtered III-nitride devices.</description>

      <title>From Cantilevers to Membranes: Advanced Scanning Protocols for Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) enables three-dimensional imaging of nuclear spin densities in nanoscale objects. Based on numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of strained SiN resonators as force sensors and show that their out-of-plane oscillation direction improves the quality of the reconstructed sample. We further introduce a multislice, compressed-sensing scan protocol that maximizes the information obtained for a given measurement time. Our simulations predict that these new scanning protocols and optimized algorithms can shorten the total acquisition time by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining the reconstruction fidelity. Our results demonstrate that combining advanced scanning protocols with state-of-the-art resonators is a promising path toward high-resolution MRFM for volumetric imaging of biological nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals as Charge Boosters for Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by growing demand for clean energy, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have emerged as promising self-powered systems, yet achieving high charge density remains a critical challenge. In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management. This work establishes NF-LC-based TENGs as a new platform for high-performance self-powered energy harvesting, linking soft matter physics with applied energy technology.</description>

      <title>Radial Mode Lithium Niobate Rosen Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate the first two-port radial-mode Rosen transformer based on 36$^{\circ}$Y-cut lithium niobate (LN) for piezoelectric power conversion. The device achieves a high transformation ratio (TF) of 16, a high electromechanical coupling factor ($k^2$) of 16.8\% and a quality factor ($Q$) of 2500, yielding an outstanding figure of merit (FoM = $Q \cdot k^2$) of 420. The fabricated transformer features a large effective turns ratio of 16 and delivers an open-circuit voltage gain of 45.56 (unloaded) and 40.57 with a load of 1 M$\Omega$ in parallel with 0.1 pF, validating its ability to provide efficient passive voltage amplification. An equivalent circuit model was developed to accurately fit both finite-element-simulated and measured admittance spectra, enabling reliable parameter extraction. These results establish LN radial-mode resonators as a promising high-performance, magnetic-less transformer platform.</description>

      <title>Residual Stress Anisotropy In Thin-Film Lithium Niobate For Stress-Managed MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first experimental study of residual stress and post-release beam deflection in 128-degree Y-cut thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) on Si, revealing pronounced stress anisotropy with in-plane orientation. Using optical profilometry with curvature fitting, we extract the stress gradient (sigma1) and generate orientation-resolved stress maps across multiple film thicknesses (100 nm, 220 nm, and 460 nm). For films in the 220 to 460 nm range, we identify stress-free in-plane orientations near approximately 55 degrees and 125 degrees, enabling extremely flat suspended beams. In contrast, ultra-thin 100 nm films exhibit shifted stress-free orientations near approximately 20 degrees and 160 degrees. Leveraging these orientations, we demonstrate very long suspended beams up to 2 cm in length, 10 micrometers in width, and 460 nm in thickness without collapse. These results establish in-plane stress anisotropy and thickness selection in TFLN as practical design levers for mechanically stable, scalable, and stress-managed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).</description>

      <title>Low-to-mid Al content ($x\sim$ 0-0.56) Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N layers deposited on Si(100) by radio-frequency sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) sputtering is a low-cost technique for the deposition of large-area single-phase AlInN on silicon layers with application in photovoltaic devices. Here, the effect of the Al mole fraction x from 0 to 0.56 on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of $n$ Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N layers deposited at 550 $^\circ$C on p-Si(100) by RF sputtering is studied. X-ray diffraction data show a wurtzite structure oriented along the c-axis in all samples, where the full width at half maximum of the rocking curve around the InN (0002) diffraction peak decreases from $\sim 9^\circ$ to $\sim 3^\circ$ while incorporating Al to the AlInN layer. The rootmean-square surface roughness, estimated from atomic force microscopy, evolves from 20 nm for InN to 1.5 nm for Al$_{0.56}$In$_{0.44}$N. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra show a blueshift of the emission energy from 1.59 eV (779 nm) for InN to 1.82 eV (681 nm) for Al$_{0.35}$In$_{0.65}$N according to the Al content rise. Hall effect measurements of Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$N ($0&lt;x &lt;0.35$) on sapphire samples grown simultaneously point to a residual n-type carrier concentration in the 1021 cm$^{-3}$ range. The developed n-AlInN/p-Si junctions present promising material properties to explore their performance operating as solar cell devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials near strong electromagnets, and application to stellarator coil optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.</description>

      <title>FORWARD: Dataset of a forwarder operating in rough terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.</description>

      <title>A Planar Huygens Antenna Utilizing Crossed Electric and Magnetic Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The natural source of a magnetic dipole in antennas is typically an electrically small loop, which can be utilized in conjunction with an electric dipole to realize an electrically small Huygens' antenna. However, these antennas suffer from low radiation efficiency and their theoretical directivity limit is 4.8 dBi. Magnetic dipoles with an electrical size larger than 0.5lambda are highly desirable for high-gain applications. This paper builds on the development of a magnetic dipole source that utilizes a 0.5lambda slot positioned near a printed dipole with a length twice that of the slot. Such a combination of electric and magnetic dipoles yields a highly directive radiation pattern, resulting in a higher gain than a uniformly illuminated antenna of similar size. The prototype is designed to operate at 4.5 GHz, with a directivity of up to 8.37 dBi. The analytical, numerical, and measured results agree fully. This high-gain superdirective antenna is highly desirable due to its excellent features, including being low-profile, PCB compatible, and having a low-complexity feeding topology, compared to the existing approach of the two-element end-fire array.</description>

      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents the design and the implementation of an inquiry-based reconstruction of Rutherford's gold foil experiment. The activity engaged students in collaborative exploration using a "black box" as an analogical model of the atom. Grounded in constructivist theory and the Focus Action-Reflection (FAR) model to introduce analogies in the in-class context, we explore how analogical reasoning can support high school students in understanding the atomic structure. Data from student worksheets, graphical representations, and group discussions were analyzed using thematic, phenomenographic, and conceptual metaphor analysis. Results indicate that students were able to develop and refine analogical models, reason from empirical evidence, and engage in critical reflection on the epistemological limits of the analogy. While students demonstrated conceptual gains and collaborative problem-solving, the analysis also revealed persistent risks of reifying metaphors or overextending macroscopic analogies to quantum domains. These findings highlight the value - and limitations - of structured analogical modeling in contemporary physics education, and point to the need for teacher training that fosters epistemological awareness and reflective use of models in the classroom.</description>
