      <title>Eighth-Order Foldy-Wouthuysen Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of higher-order binding corrections to bound systems is a fundamental problem of theoretical physics. For any nonrelativistic expansion, one needs the Foldy-Wouthuysen Transformation which disentangles the particle and the antiparticle degrees of freedom. This transformation is carried out here to eighth order in the momenta, or, to eighth order in the momentum operators, which is equivalent to the eighth order of the fine-structure constant. Matrix elements of the eighth-order terms are evaluated for F_5/2 and F_7/2 states in hydrogenlike ions and compared with the Dirac-Coulomb energy levels.</description>

      <title>Effects of alloying elements on carbon diffusion in the austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TThe effects of alloying elements on diffusion pathways and migration energies of interstitial carbon in austenite (f.c.c.) and ferrite (b.c.c.) are studied using density functional theory first-principles calculations. The binding energies between carbon and alloying elements are determined through 6th nearest-neighbor (NN) distances. The elements studied are Ni, Mo, V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Al, Ti, and Si, relevant to most high-strength steels. Nickel, Mn, Al, and Si have repulsive binding energies; Mo, V, Cr, Cu, and Ti have attractive binding energies in austenite and ferrite. Alloying elements at 1st NN sites of a C atom in an octahedral site introduce asymmetry into the minimum energy diffusion pathway, causing up to about 1 eV changes in saddle-point energies. This pathway goes from one octahedral site to another via intermediate energy states, differing for austenite and ferrite. We find that the elements with attractive binding energies increase the energy barrier for C migration resulting in decelerated carbon diffusion, while the elements with repulsive binding energies decrease the energy barrier for C migration leading to accelerated C diffusion. The magnitude of changes in C migration energies is proportional to the binding energies between C and alloying elements. Among the three austenite stabilizers, Ni and Mn are C diffusion accelerators, while Cu decelerates C diffusion in austenite. Among the four ferrite stabilizers, Si is a C diffusion accelerator, while V and Ti serve as C diffusion decelerators in ferrite. Aluminum has no significant effect on C's diffusivity, while Mo and Cr decelerate C diffusion.</description>

      <title>Benford's law in atomic spectra and opacity databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intriguing law of anomalous numbers, also named Benford's law, states that the significant digits of data follow a logarithmic distribution favoring the smallest values. In this work, we test the compliance with this law of the atomic databases developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) focusing on line energies, oscillator strengths, Einstein coefficients and radiative opacities. The considered databases are the Atomic Spectra Database (ASD) and the NIST-LANL (Los Alamos National Laboratory) Lanthanide/Actinide Opacity Database. The present study is not limited to the first digit and the case of multipole lines is also considered. The fact that the law is verified with a high accuracy means that the occurrence of digits reflects the constraints induced, in a given angular-momentum coupling, by the selection rules for atomic processes. As a consequence, Benford's law may be of great interest to detect inconsistencies in atomic databases.</description>

      <title>Collectively enhanced ground-state cooling in subwavelength atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays in free space are becoming a leading platform for exploring emergent many-body quantum phenomena. These arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. We derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</description>

      <title>Characterization of ion-trap-induced ac-magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oscillating magnetic field produced by unbalanced currents in radio-frequency ion traps induces transition frequency shifts and sideband transitions that can be harmful to precision spectroscopy experiments. Here, we describe a methodology, based on two-photon spectroscopy, for determining both the strength and direction of rf-induced magnetic fields without modifying any DC magnetic bias field or changing any trap RF power. The technique is readily applicable to any trapped-ion experiment featuring narrow linewidth transitions.</description>

      <title>Trapped particle evolution driven by residual gas collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive mathematical model and experimental measurements for the evolution of a trapped particle ensemble driven by collisions with a room-temperature background vapor. The model accommodates any trap geometry, confining potential, initial trapped distribution, and other experimental details; it only depends on the the probability distribution function $P_t(E)$ for the collision-induced energy transfer to the trapped ensemble. We describe how to find $P_t(E)$ using quantum scattering calculations and how it can be approximated using quantum diffractive universality. We then compare our model to experimental measurements of a $^{87}$Rb ensemble energy evolution exposed to a room temperature background gas of Ar by means of a single parameter fit for the total collision rate $\Gamma$. We extracted a collision rate of $\Gamma = 0.646(1)\ \text{s}^{-1}$. This is compared to a value of $0.664(4)\ \text{s}^{-1}$ found by the commonly used method of zero-trap depth extrapolation, a $2.8\%$ correction that is a result of our model fully taking ensemble loss and heating into account. Finally, we report a five-fold increase in the precision of our collision rate extraction from the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We perform a comparative study of light storage in antirelaxation-coated and buffer-gas-filled alkali-vapor cells using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in warm rubidium vapor. The use of a buffer-gas-filled cell resulted in $\approx$10-fold improvement in storage time and efficiency compared to antirelaxation coated cells. Our findings contribute to the development of future field-deployable high-performance quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Light scattering properties beyond weak-field excitation in atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of optical properties of large atomic system, a weak laser driving is often assumed to simplify the system dynamics by linearly coupled equations. Here, we investigate the light scattering properties of atomic ensembles beyond weak-field excitation through the cumulant expansion method. By progressively incorporating higher-order correlations into the steady-state equations, an enhanced accuracy can be achieved in comparison to the exact solutions from solving a full density matrix. Our analysis reveals that, in the regime of weak dipole-dipole interaction (DDI), the first-order expansion yields satisfactory predictions for optical depth, while denser atomic configurations necessitate consideration of higher-order correlations. As the intensity of incident light increases, atom saturation effects become noticeable, giving rise to significant changes in light transparency, energy shift, and decay rate. This saturation phenomenon extends to subradiant atom arrays even under weak driving conditions, leading to substantial deviations from the linear model. Our findings demonstrate the mean-field models as good extensions to linear models as it balances both accuracy and computational complexity. However, the crucial role of higher-order cumulants in large and dense atom systems remains unclear, since it is challenging theoretically owing to the exponentially increasing Hilbert space in such light-matter interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of spin-squeezing generation in cavity-coupled atomic ensembles with continuous measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of three-level atoms to an optical cavity and continuous quantum measurement of the transmitted cavity field in order to monitor the evolution of the atomic ensemble. Using analytical treatment and microscopic simulations of the dynamics, we show that one can achieve significant spin squeezing, favorably scaling with the number of atoms $N$. However, contrary to some previous literature, we clarify that it is not possible to obtain Heisenberg scaling without the continuous feedback that is proposed in optimal approaches. In fact, in the adiabatic cavity removal approximation and large $N$ limit, we find the scaling behavior $N^{-2/3}$ for spin squeezing and $N^{-1/3}$ for the corresponding protocol duration. These results can be obtained only by considering the curvature of the Bloch sphere, since linearizing the collective spin operators tangentially to its equator yields inaccurate predictions. With full simulations, we characterize how spin-squeezing generation depends on the system parameters and departs from the bad cavity regime, by gradually mixing with cavity-filling dynamics until metrological advantage is lost. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this spin-squeezing protocol to state-of-the-art optical clocks.</description>

      <title>The hydrogen atom perturbed by a 1-dimensional Simple Harmonic Oscillator (1d-SHO) potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen atom perturbed by a constant 1-dimensional weak quadratic potential $\lambda z^2$ is solved at first-order perturbation theory using the eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator - the coupled basis. Physical applications of this result could be found, for example, in the study of a quadratic Zeeman effect weaker than fine-structure effects, or in a perturbation caused by instantaneous generalised van der Waals interactions.</description>
