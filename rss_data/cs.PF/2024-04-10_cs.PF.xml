      <title>Impact of Extensions on Browser Performance: An Empirical Study on Google Chrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web browsers have been used widely by users to conduct various online activities, such as information seeking or online shopping. To improve user experience and extend the functionality of browsers, practitioners provide mechanisms to allow users to install third-party-provided plugins (i.e., extensions) on their browsers. However, little is known about the performance implications caused by such extensions. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to understand the impact of extensions on the user-perceived performance (i.e., energy consumption and page load time) of Google Chrome, the most popular browser. We study a total of 72 representative extensions from 11 categories (e.g., Developer Tools and Sports). We observe that browser performance can be negatively impacted by the use of extensions, even when the extensions are used in unintended circumstances (e.g., when logging into an extension is not granted but required, or when an extension is not used for designated websites). We also identify a set of factors that significantly influence the performance impact of extensions, such as code complexity and privacy practices (i.e., collection of user data) adopted by the extensions. Based on our empirical observations, we provide recommendations for developers and users to mitigate the performance impact of browser extensions, such as conducting performance testing and optimization for unintended usage scenarios of extensions, or adhering to proper usage practices of extensions (e.g., logging into an extension when required).</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Convergence Time of ML Algorithms via Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper leverages the statistics of extreme values to predict the worst-case convergence times of machine learning algorithms. Timing is a critical non-functional property of ML systems, and providing the worst-case converge times is essential to guarantee the availability of ML and its services. However, timing properties such as worst-case convergence times (WCCT) are difficult to verify since (1) they are not encoded in the syntax or semantics of underlying programming languages of AI, (2) their evaluations depend on both algorithmic implementations and underlying systems, and (3) their measurements involve uncertainty and noise. Therefore, prevalent formal methods and statistical models fail to provide rich information on the amounts and likelihood of WCCT.
  Our key observation is that the timing information we seek represents the extreme tail of execution times. Therefore, extreme value theory (EVT), a statistical discipline that focuses on understanding and predicting the distribution of extreme values in the tail of outcomes, provides an ideal framework to model and analyze WCCT in the training and inference phases of ML paradigm. Building upon the mathematical tools from EVT, we propose a practical framework to predict the worst-case timing properties of ML. Over a set of linear ML training algorithms, we show that EVT achieves a better accuracy for predicting WCCTs than relevant statistical methods such as the Bayesian factor. On the set of larger machine learning training algorithms and deep neural network inference, we show the feasibility and usefulness of EVT models to accurately predict WCCTs, their expected return periods, and their likelihood.</description>
