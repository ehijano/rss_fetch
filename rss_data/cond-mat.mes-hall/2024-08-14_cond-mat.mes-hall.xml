      <title>Vestigial Gapless Boson Density Wave Emerging between $\nu = 1/2$ Fractional Chern Insulator and Finite-Momentum Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</description>

      <title>Misalignment-robust zigzag gate geometry for valley filtering with helical point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experimental works reported the generation of valley-polarized currents in two-dimensional materials. However, most efforts require the application of external magnetic fields. Gate-defined valley-helical narrow channels offer a magnetic field-free approach to generate valley currents. However, achieving perfect helical transport in such gate-defined devices remains challenging due to stringent requirements for gate alignment. Misalignments lead to the presence of non-helical states that suppress the efficiency of these devices. Here, we propose an alternative gate layout to overcome the fabrication challenges. Our layout creates a series of helical quantum point contacts that suppress the transmission of non-helical modes. We show that such a layout can be implemented with four layers of independent gates or two layers of split gates. Thus, our approach offers a robust magnetic field-free platform to generate valley-polarized currents.</description>

      <title>Extreme Enhancement-Mode Operation Accumulation Channel Hydrogen-Terminated Diamond FETs with $V_{th} &lt; -6V$ and High On-Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate a new Field Effect Transistor device concept based on hydrogen-terminated diamond (H-diamond) that operates in an Accumulation Channel rather than Transfer Doping regime. Our FET devices demonstrate both extreme enhancement-mode operation and high on-current with improved channel charge mobility compared to Transfer-Doped equivalents. Electron-beam evaporated $Al_2O_3$ is used on H-diamond to suppress the Transfer Doping mechanism and produce an extremely high ungated channel resistance. A high-quality H-diamond surface with an unpinned Fermi level is crucially achieved, allowing for formation of a high-density hole accumulation layer by gating the entire device channel which is encapsulated in dual-stacks of $Al_2O_3$. Completed devices with gate/channel length of $1 \mu m$ demonstrate record threshold voltage $&lt; -6 V$ with on-current $&gt; 80 mA/mm$. Carrier density and mobility figures extracted by CV analysis indicate high 2D charge density of $~ 2 \times 10^{12} cm^{-2}$ and increased hole mobility of $110 cm^2 /V \cdot s$ in comparison with more traditional Transfer-Doped H-diamond FETs. These results demonstrate the most negative threshold voltage yet reported for H-diamond FETs and highlight a new strategy for the development of high-performance power devices that better exploit diamond's intrinsic dielectric properties and high hole mobility.</description>

      <title>Efficient driving of a spin-qubit using single-atom magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Interlayer excitons in double-layer transition metal dichalcogenides quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various properties of interlayer excitons in double-layer transition metal dichalcogenides quantum dots are analyzed using a low-energy effective Hamiltonian with Coulomb interaction. We solve the single-particle Hamiltonian with and without a magnetic field analytically, then present the electron-hole pairing features of interlayer exciton by employing the exact diagonalization technique, where the electron and hole are located in two layers respectively. In a magnetic field, the Landau level gap, as well as the electron-hole separation of an exciton varies non-monotonously as the interlayer distance increases, attributed to the pseudospin-orbit coupling which also leads to the emergence of topological non-trivial pseudospin textures in the exciton states. We examine the influence of different materials in quantum dots stacking on the exciton states, comparing their impact to variations in layer distances and quantum dot sizes. We further explore two interacting interlayer excitons numerically. The binding energy is significantly enhanced by the exchange interaction when the two electrons have different spins. The optical absorption spectra from the ground state to low-lying excited states reveal distinct behaviors for different interlayer excitons, which can be utilized to distinguish the spin of electrons in excitons. Our results highlight the potential for controlling interlayer excitons and applications of optical devices in a magnetic field and tunable layer distance.</description>

      <title>Symmetric n-and p-Type Sub-5-nm 1D Graphene Nanoribbon Transistors for Homogeneous CMOS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbon (GNR) emerges as an exceptionally promising channel candidate due to its tunable sizable bandgap (0-3 eV), ultrahigh carrier mobility (up to 4600 cm^(2) V^(-1) s^(-1)), and excellent device performance (current on-off ratio of 10^(7)). However, the asymmetry of reported n-type and p-type GNR field-effect transistors (FETs) at ultrashort gate length (Lg) has become an obstacle to future complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integration. Here, we conduct ab initio quantum transport simulations to investigate the transport properties of sub-5-nm Lg 7 armchair-edge GNR (7 AGNR) FETs. The on-state current, delay time, and power dissipation of the n-type and p-type 7 AGNR FETs fulfill the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors targets for high-performance devices when Lg is reduced to 3 nm. Remarkably, the 7 AGNR FETs exhibit superior n-type and p-type symmetry to the 7-9-7 AGNR FETs due to the more symmetrical electron/hole effective masses. Compared to the monolayer MoS2 and MoTe2 counterparts, the 7 AGNR FETs have better device performance, which could be further improved via gate engineering. Our results shed light on the immense potential of 7 AGNR in advancing CMOS electronics beyond silicon.</description>

      <title>Bilayer TeO2: The First Oxide Semiconductor with Symmetric Sub-5-nm NMOS and PMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide bandgap oxide semiconductors are very promising channel candidates for next-generation electronics due to their large-area manufacturing, high-quality dielectrics, low contact resistance, and low leakage current. However, the absence of ultra-short gate length (Lg) p-type transistors has restricted their application in future complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) integration. Inspired by the successfully grown high-hole mobility bilayer (BL) beta tellurium dioxide (\b{eta}-TeO2), we investigate the performance of sub-5-nm-Lg BL \b{eta}-TeO2 field-effect transistors (FETs) by utilizing first-principles quantum transport simulation. The distinctive anisotropy of BL \b{eta}-TeO2 yields different transport properties. In the y-direction, both the sub-5-nm-Lg n-type and p-type BL \b{eta}-TeO2 FETs can fulfill the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) criteria for high-performance (HP) devices, which are superior to the reported oxide FETs (only n-type). Remarkably, we for the first time demonstrate the existence of the NMOS and PMOS symmetry in sub-5-nm-Lg oxide semiconductor FETs. As to the x-direction, the n-type BL \b{eta}-TeO2 FETs satisfy both the ITRS HP and low-power (LP) requirements with Lg down to 3 nm. Consequently, our work shed light on the tremendous prospects of BL \b{eta}-TeO2 for CMOS application.</description>

      <title>Visualizing $p$-orbital texture in the charge-density-wave state of CeSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collective reorganization of electrons into a charge density wave (CDW) inside a crystal has long served as a textbook example of an ordered phase in condensed matter physics. Two-dimensional square lattices with $p$ electrons are well-suited to the realization of CDW, due to the anisotropy of the $p$ orbitals and the resulting one dimensionality of the electronic structure. In spite of a long history of study of CDW in square-lattice systems, few reports have recognized the existence and significance of a hidden orbital degree of freedom. The degeneracy of $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons inherent to a square lattice may give rise to nontrivial orbital patterns in real space that endow the CDW with additional broken symmetries or unusual order parameters. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we visualize signatures of $p$-orbital texture in the CDW state of the topological semimetal candidate CeSbTe, which contains Sb square lattices with 5$p$ electrons. We image atomic-sized, anisotropic lobes of charge density with periodically modulating anisotropy, that ultimately can be mapped onto a microscopic pattern of $p_x$ and $p_y$ bond density waves. Our results show that even delocalized $p$ orbitals can reorganize into unexpected and emergent electronic states of matter.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Quantum Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first quantum fractal discovered in physics is the Hofstadter butterfly. It stems from large external magnetic fields. We discover instead a new class of non-Hermitian quantum fractals (NHQFs) emerging in coupled Hatano-Nelson models on a tree lattice in absence of any fields. Based on analytic solutions, we are able to rigorously identify the self-similar recursive structures in energy spectrum and wave functions. We prove that the complex spectrum of NHQFs bears a resemblance to the Mandelbrot set in fractal theory. The self-similarity of NHQFs is rooted in the interplay between the iterative lattice configuration and non-Hermiticity. Moreover, we show that NHQFs exist in generalized non-Hermitian systems with iterative lattice structures. Our findings open a new avenue for investigating quantum fractals in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Skin effect in Non-Hermitian systems with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The skin effect, where bulk modes collapse into boundary modes, is a key phenomenon in topological non-Hermitian systems, has been predominantly studied in spinless systems. Recent studies illustrate the magnetic suppression of the first-order skin effect while ignoring spin. However, the physical significance of a magnetic field in non-Hermitian skin effect with spin remains elusive. Here, we systematically explore non-Hermitian spinful systems based on generalized Hatano-Nelson models with SU(2) gauge potential fields. In an open one-dimensional lattice, the spin-up and spin-down states can be uniquely separated and localized at the two boundaries without magnetic field. When an external magnetic field is applied, the skin effect exhibits a smooth transition from bidirectional to unidirectional. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the first-order skin effect can be anomalously induced by a magnetic field in a topologically trivial non-Hermitian spinful system without any skin effect at zero field. The direction of such magnetically induced skin modes can be controlled by simply changing the amplitude and polarity of the magnetic field. In addition, we demonstrate a transition between non-Bloch PT and anti-PT symmetries in the system, and uncover the spindependent mechanism of non-Bloch PT symmetry. Our results pave the way for the investigation of non-Hermitian skin effect with spin degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Lateral Mn5Ge3 spin-valve in contact with a high-mobility Ge two-dimensional hole gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge two-dimensional hole gases in strained modulation-doped quantum-wells represent a promising material platform for future spintronic applications due to their excellent spin transport properties and the theoretical possibility of efficient spin manipulation. Due to the continuous development of epitaxial growth recipes extreme high hole mobilities and low effective masses can be achieved, promising an efficient spin transport. Furthermore, the Ge two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) can be integrated in the well-established industrial complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices technology. However, efficient electrical spin injection into a Ge 2DHG - a prerequisite for the realization of spintronic devices - has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we report the fabrication and low-temperature magnetoresistance measurements of a laterally structured Mn5Ge3/Ge 2DHG/ Mn5Ge3 device. The ferromagnetic Mn5Ge3 contacts are grown directly into the Ge quantum well by means of an interdiffusion process with a spacing of approximately 130 nm. We observe a magnetoresistance signal for temperatures below 13 K possibly arising from successful spin injection. The results represent a step forward toward the realization of CMOS compatible spintronic devices based on a 2DHG.</description>

      <title>Imaging strain-controlled magnetic reversal in thin CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are extraordinarily sensitive to external stimuli, making them ideal for studying fundamental properties and for engineering devices with new functionalities. One such stimulus, strain, affects the magnetic properties of the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr to such a degree that it can induce a reversible antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition. Given the pervasiveness of non-uniform strain in exfoliated two-dimensional magnets, it is crucial to understand its impact on their magnetic behavior. Using scanning SQUID-on-lever microscopy, we directly image the effects of spatially inhomogeneous strain on the magnetization of layered CrSBr as it is polarized by a field applied along its easy axis. The evolution of this magnetization and the formation of domains is reproduced by a micromagnetic model, which incorporates the spatially varying strain and the corresponding changes in the local interlayer exchange stiffness. The observed sensitivity to small strain gradients along with similar images of a nominally unstrained CrSBr sample suggest that unintentional strain inhomogeneity influences the magnetic behavior of exfoliated samples and must be considered in the design of future devices.</description>

      <title>Enabling two-dimensional electron gas with high room-temperature electron mobility exceeding 100 cm$^2$/Vs at a perovskite oxide interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In perovskite oxide heterostructures, bulk functional properties coexist with emergent physical phenomena at epitaxial interfaces. Notably, charge transfer at the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g., high-electronmobility transistors and ferroelectric field-effect transistors. So far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the interface between the single-crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing their deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally, the substrate-limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers room-temperature 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In this work, we demonstrate the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO$_3$ and LaInO$_3$ with enhanced room-temperature electron mobilities up to 119 cm$^2$/Vs - the highest room-temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a combination of state-of-the-art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam epitaxy, our approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and $in$-$situ$ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away from the substrate interface. We thus expect our approach to apply to the general class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved compatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials platforms.</description>

      <title>The effect of mixed termination composition in Sc, Ti, and V-based MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of mixed surface terminations (F, O, OH) on the properties of M$_{2}$C MXenes (M = Sc, Ti, V). We explore how different compositions and patterns of terminal groups affect the stability and electronic properties of these 2D materials. The bond dissociation energies and cohesion energies show a clear preference for F-terminations in Sc$_{2}$C, while Ti- and V-based MXenes prefer O-terminations. The data indicates that terminal groups on opposite sides of the MXene have little to no influence on each other's electronic structure, allowing for independent chemical environments on each side. Semiconducting forms of studied MXenes (Sc$_{2}$CF$_{2}$, Sc$_{2}$C(OH)$_{2}$ and Ti$_{2}$CO$_{2}$) showed very high sensitivity to conduction-inducing terminations (O, O, and F, respectively) with even minuscule amounts ($\approx$1%) causing the materials to become conductive. This high sensitivity of the band gap to surface terminations may offer an explanation for the challenges in synthesizing semiconducting forms of MXenes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K2Cr3As3 Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A2Cr3As3 (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K2Cr3As3, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2{\phi}) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and {\pi}-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to {\pi}-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the {\pi}-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K2Cr3As3.</description>

      <title>Forming and Compliance-free Operation of Low-power, Fast-switching HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Heterostructure Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate low power, forming and compliance-free operation of a resistive memory obtained by the partial oxidation of a two-dimensional layered van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). Semiconductor - oxide heterostructures are achieved by low temperature ($&lt;300^{o}$C) thermal oxidation of HfS$_2$ in dry conditions, carefully controlling process parameters such as pressure, temperature and oxygen flow. The resulting HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ heterostructures are integrated between metal contacts, forming vertical crossbar devices. Forming-free, compliance-free resistive switching between two non-volatile states is demonstrated by applying voltage sweeps. By applying voltage pulses and measuring the current response in time, we show non-volatile memory operation programmable by 60ns, $&lt;$ 20pJ WRITE and ERASE operations. Multiple stable resistance states are achievable by pulse width and amplitude modulation demonstrating the capability for multi-state programming. Resistance states were retained without fail at 85$^o$C and 150$^o$C, showcasing the potential of these devices for long retention times. Using a technology computer-aided design (TCAD) tool (Synopsys Sentaurus, 2022), we explore the role of the semiconductor layer in tuning the device conductance and driving gradual resistive switching in 2D HfO$_x$ - based devices.</description>

      <title>Cyclic and helical symmetry-informed machine learned force fields: Application to lattice vibrations in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formalism for developing cyclic and helical symmetry-informed machine learned force fields (MLFFs). In particular, employing the smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptors with the polynomial kernel method, we derive cyclic and helical symmetry-adapted expressions for the energy, atomic forces, and phonons (describe lattice vibration frequencies and modes). We use this formulation to construct a symmetry-informed MLFF for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), where the model is trained through Bayesian linear regression, with the data generated from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations performed during on-the-fly symmetry-informed MLFF molecular dynamics simulations of representative CNTs. We demonstrate the accuracy of the MLFF model by comparisons with DFT calculations for the energies and forces, and density functional perturbation theory calculations for the phonons, while considering CNTs not used in the training. In particular, we obtain a root mean square error of $1.4 \times 10^{-4}$ Ha/atom, $4.7 \times 10^{-4}$ Ha/Bohr, and 4.8 cm$^{-1}$ in the energy, forces, and phonon frequencies, respectively, which are well within the accuracy targeted in ab initio calculations. We apply this framework to study phonons in CNTs of various diameters and chiralities, where we identify the torsional rigid body mode that is unique to cylindrical structures and establish laws for variation of the phonon frequencies associated with the ring modes and radial breathing modes. Overall, the proposed formalism provides an avenue for studying nanostructures with cyclic and helical symmetry at ab initio accuracy, while providing orders-of-magnitude speedup relative to such methods.</description>

      <title>Band-selective simulation of photoelectron intensity and converging Berry phase in trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berry phase is one of the key elements to understand quantum-mechanical phenomena such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the unconventional Hall effect in graphene. The Berry phase in monolayer and bilayer graphene has been manifested by the anisotropic distribution of photoelectron intensity along a closed loop in the momentum space as well as its rotation by a characteristic angle upon rotating light polarization. Here we report the band-selective simulation of photoelectron intensity of trilayer graphene to understand its Berry phase within the tight-binding formalism. ABC- and ABA-stacked trilayer graphene show characteristic rotational angles of photoelectron intensity distribution, as predicted from their well-known Berry phases. Surprisingly, however, in ABA-stacked trilayer graphene, the rotational angle changes upon approaching toward the band touching point between the conduction and valence bands, which suggest that Berry phase changes as a function of binding energy. The binding energy-dependent Berry phase is attributed to the enhanced hybridization of the two electron bands of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene that converge at the band touching point, resulting in the converging Berry phase. These findings will provide an efficient way of tuning Berry phase and hence exotic phenomena stemming from the Berry phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics under an oscillating electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron oscillating under the field is asymmetric with respect to the direction of its forward movement. Since emission of each photon is accompanied by momentum transfer to the electron, such a skew emission leads to the quantum recoil force decelerating the electron. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for various electronic systems driven by laser irradiation.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of adiabatic tunneling out of a shallow confinement potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to tune quantum tunneling is key for achieving selectivity in manipulation of individual particles in quantum technology applications. In this work we count electron escape events out of a time-dependent confinement potential, realized as a dynamic quantum dot in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. A universal scaling relation of the escape probability as a function of potential barrier rise time and depth is established and developed as a method to probe tunneling rates over many orders of magnitude reaching the limit of shallow anharmonic confinement. Crossover to thermally activated transport is used to estimate the single time-energy scale of the universal model. In application to metrological single electron sources, in-situ calibrated control signals greatly extend the accessible dynamical range for probing the quantization mechanism. Validation of the cubic potential approximation sets a foundation for microscopic modeling of quantum tunneling devices in the shallow confinement regime.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall Switching by Surface-State-Mediated Spin-Orbit Torque in a Hard Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05603v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) and magnetic topological insulators (MTI) can apply highly efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface states with ultra-high efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST) with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence of an external magnetic field. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 $k\Omega$ is realized, among the largest of all SOT systems, which makes the Hall channel a good readout and eliminates the need to fabricate complicated magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structures. The SOT switching current density can be reduced to $2.8\times10^5 A/cm^2$. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from edge-state-mediated to surface-state-mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT effective field to $1.56\pm 0.12 T/ (10^6 A/cm^2)$ and the interfacial charge-to-spin conversion efficiency to $3.9\pm 0.3 nm^{-1}$. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular junctions -- whether actual single molecules in nanowire break junctions or artificial molecules realized in coupled quantum dot devices -- offer unique functionality due to their orbital complexity, strong electron interactions, gate control, and many-body effects from hybridization with the external electronic circuit. Inverse design involves finding candidate structures that perform a desired function optimally. Here we develop an inverse design strategy for generalized quantum impurity models describing molecular junctions, and as an example, use it to demonstrate that many-body quantum interference can be leveraged to realize the two-channel Kondo critical point in simple 4- or 5-site molecular moieties. We show that remarkably high Kondo temperatures can be achieved, meaning that entropy and transport signatures should be experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Topological Orders Beyond Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03353v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interactions between anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing exact dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally encode aspects of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in ultrafast electron emission, microscopy, and diffraction have demonstrated a remarkable ability to manipulate free electrons with quantum coherence using light beams. Here, we present a framework for exploring free electron quantum number in ultrafast electron-light interactions. We derive an explicit Jackiw-Rebbi solution for a low-energy free electron wavefunction subjected to a spatiotemporally twisted laser field, resulting in a flying topologically protected bound state with a quantum number of e/2 - termed a "half-electron". This flying bound state is dispersion-free due to its topological nature. We demonstrate the topological confinement and pair generation mechanism of half-electrons in free space, expanding their domain beyond the topological states typically found in solids and photonics. This advancement enhances our understanding of emulating exotic quantum and topological effects with low-energy free electrons.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically a setup consisting of excitons formed in two valleys, with proximity-induced Cooper pairing, different in the conduction and valence bands. Due to the combination of a Coulomb interaction with superconducting proximity effects, Cooper pairing between electrons from conduction and valence bands from different valleys is formed. This finite-energy intervalley Cooper pairing has both even- and odd-frequency contributions. We show that there is a phase transition into the formation of a robust macroscopic condensate of such Cooper pairs and present characteristics of the corresponding Higgs modes.</description>

Abstract: We propose the realization of interaction-driven insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). By analyzing the tunable band structure and band geometry via strain, and performing extensive many-body exact diagonalization of a realistic model, we present compelling evidence for realizing various fractional Chern insulators in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs. Our thorough analysis across different strain parameters, accounting for experimental variability, reveals that a broad spectrum of fractional Chern insulators, including the Laughlin states, Halperin 112, 332 and 111 states, and Chern number |C| = 2 states, can be stabilized in distinct regions of the phase diagram. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum lattice structures which consist of joined elastic beams subject to flexural deformations are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. Here, first, we reveal the topological dynamics of continuous beam structures by rigorously proving the existence of infinitely many topological edge states within the bandgaps. Then, we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological phases of bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the Zak phase that determines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is directly applicable to general continuum lattice structures. We demonstrate the topological edge states of bridge-like frames, plates, and continuous beams on elastic foundations and springs, and the topological corner states of kagome frames. The continuum lattice structures serve as excellent platforms for exploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the topologically protected states at multifrequencies, and their topological dynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.</description>
