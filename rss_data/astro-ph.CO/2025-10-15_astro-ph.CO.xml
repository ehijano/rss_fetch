      <title>Eternal inflation bubble collision signature on CMB remote dipole and quadrupole fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remote dipole and quadrupole fields (RDF/RQF) encode information about the observable universe as seen from remote places within our past light cone. Sensitive to the superhorizon inhomogeneites, they provide a unique way to probe physics at the largest scales, bypassing the limitations of cosmic variance inherent in the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we focus on the bubble collision predicted by the eternal inflation theory, which can leave distinct azimuthally symmetric patterns on the superhorizon scales, potentially detectable through the RDF and RQF. We present the first analytic expression of the RQF signal induced by bubble collision and validate it against numerical calculations performed with $\texttt{RemoteField}$, a new public software tool we developed, finding excellent agreement between the two. Combining our new RQF calculation with the corresponding RDF signal calculated by prior work, we forecast the constraining power on bubble collision parameters using RDF/RQF reconstruction. We find that, for an CMB-S4-like and an LSST-like experiment, the RDF reconstruction can provide comparable constraining power as that from the primary CMB alone; and the RQF reconstruction can improve the constraining power by about an order of magnitude. We argue that these constraints can be improved further by including more RDF/RQF multipoles included and by using tomographic techniques to mitigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM signal. We anticipate the framework we developed in this work to be broadly applicable to probe other superhorizon-scale physics, such as cosmic topology and domain walls.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Localization of Dark Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Enables Host Galaxy Identification and Precise Cosmological Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensed gravitational wave (GW) events are expected to be powerful new probes of cosmology, contingent on redshift measurement by electromagnetic observations. Host galaxy identification is thus crucial but challenging due to poor localization by GW signal alone. In this paper, we show that the third-generation ground-based GW detectors will detect a population of lensed events with three or more detectable images (including the central one), each arriving at distinct times and Earth locations in the space, forming an effective network that reduces the typical localization area to $\sim0.01$ deg$^2$. For at least $90\%$ (or $50\%$) of these events, the localization improves by more than a factor of $10$ (or $30$) comparing with unlensed cases. Such precise localization and multiple-image detections enable robust host-galaxy identification and, through lens modelling, further yield sub-arcsecond position. As ``dark lensed sirens", these events become powerful probes of cosmological parameters. Using simulated lensed compact-binary mergers, we show that two-year or longer observations with third-generation GW detectors can measure the Hubble constant to $\lesssim1$\% precision via ``dark lensed sirens" (even when relying solely on lensed stellar-mass binary black hole events), while simultaneously constraining other cosmological parameters. This approach will provide an independent, complementary avenue for measuring cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-linear structure formation with elastic interactions in the dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.</description>

      <title>Mass dependence of halo baryon fractions from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12553v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detect the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich imprint of peculiar motions of galaxy groups and clusters, using the photometric DESI Legacy Survey together with cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We develop a comprehensive forward model based on the AbacusSummit cosmological simulations: mock galaxy group catalogues and synthetic kSZ maps are generated, together with a reconstructed peculiar velocity field that allows for photo-$z$ errors, redshift-space distortions, and survey masks. We investigate possible contamination from the cosmic infrared background (CIB), finding that CIB effects are subdominant to the kSZ signal in the relevant ACT frequency channel. We then predict the kSZ signal expected when stacking CMB temperature maps around groups, taking account of their estimated radial velocity. Comparing the model with observations, we are able to constrain the total baryon fraction within haloes, as well as their internal gas profiles. We find evidence for mass dependence of the halo baryon fraction within the virial radius. The gas fraction in massive groups is consistent with the universal baryon fraction, but low-mass groups ($10^{12.5} \lesssim M\,/h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim 10^{14}$) are depleted to $0.21 \pm 0.06$ times the universal baryon fraction. We find this low virial baryon fraction to be consistent with an extended gas profile, for which the total baryon content reaches the universal value well beyond the virial radius. This conclusion is consistent with previous analyses using X-ray, kSZ, and weak lensing, and plausibly reflects energetic feedback processes from the galaxies in these haloes.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>GEFF: The Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - A tool for inflationary gauge-field production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GEFF - the Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - is a new Python package designed to study gauge-field production during inflation. The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical summaries for primordial non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\rm NL}$, with $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\%$ at low $k_{\rm max}$ ($\sim 0.1 \, h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum. This approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable pathway to tighten the PNG constraints from forthcoming survey data.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>

      <title>On the Speed-up of Wave-like Dark Matter Searches with Entangled Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit-based sensing platforms offer promising new directions for wave-like dark matter searches. Recent proposals demonstrate that entangled qubits can achieve quadratic scaling of the signal in the number of qubits. In this work we expand on these proposals to analyze the bandwidth and scan rate performance of entangled qubit protocols across different error regimes. We find that the phase-based readout of entangled protocols preserves the search bandwidth independent of qubit number, in contrast to power-based detection schemes, thereby achieving a genuine scan-rate advantage. We derive coherence time and error rate requirements for qubit systems to realize this advantage. Applying our analysis to dark photon searches, we find that entangled states of approximately 100 qubits can become competitive with benchmark photon-counting cavity experiments for masses $\gtrsim 30{-}40~\mu{\rm eV}$, provided sufficiently low error rates are achieved. The advantage increases at higher masses where cavity volume scaling becomes less favorable.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated tilt of isocurvature fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields acquire isocurvature fluctuations during inflation. While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''&lt;3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain ``flaton fields" defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed.</description>

Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by B\"ohmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system. Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.</description>

      <title>The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Is Milky Way stable all the way ? A TNG50 view from cosmic noon to the present day</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of Milky Way analogs (MWAs) in the \texttt{TNG50} simulation against the growth of local axisymmetric instabilities, tracing their evolution from cosmic noon ($z=2.5$) to the present day ($z=0$). Using a two-component stability criterion that accounts for stars, gas, and the force field of the dark matter halo, we compute the net stability parameter ($Q_{T}$), the critical gas surface density ($\Sigma_{c}$), and the instability timescale ($\tau$) for 10 barred and 10 unbarred MWAs. We find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all epochs, with $Q_{T}^{\min}&gt;2$. The stability levels increase toward higher redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density remains subcritical ($\Sigma_{g}&lt;\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}&gt;1)$, a combination of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even when $Q_{T}&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Extremely UV-bright starbursts at the end of cosmic reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of 27 very UV-bright (-22.0&lt;MUV&lt;-24.4) sources at z~6 identified in SHELLQs survey. Stacking their rest-frame UV spectra reveals a prominent NV1240A P-Cygni, consistent with very young (~6Myr) stellar populations dominated by massive stars. They are thus powerful and efficient ionizing starbursts with an average ionizing photon production efficiency of log(Xi_ion/Hz erg-1)=25.54. For one of these, J0217-0208 at z=6.2 (MUV=-23.4), we analyzed NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Its SED indicates a young (~5Myr), compact (reff~260pc) starburst with a stellar mass of 10^9Msun and high sSFR (~100Gyr^-1). This translates to high stellar mass and SFR surface densities, about 100x higher than typical galaxies at similar redshifts. NIRSpec further reveals strong nebular emission, for which we derive a high electron density (~10^3 cm^-3), a metallicity 12+log(O/H)=8.20 (from the direct method), and a super-solar N/O ratio (log(N/O)=-0.30). Furthermore, J0217-0208 shows broad components in several rest-optical lines, indicating powerful ionized outflows, which appear heavily obscured (E(B-V)~0.6), in contrast to the nearly dust-free stellar continuum (E(B-V)~0.01). Combined with ALMA detections of a massive, extended, and cold dust reservoir, these findings point to dusty, feedback-driven outflows carrying and pushing dust well beyond the stellar core, boosting the observed UV luminosity. Our results suggest that UV-bright galaxies at high redshift represent short-lived but extreme phases of rapid stellar mass growth, efficient ionizing photon production, and strong feedback. The extreme properties of J0217-0208, such as supersolar N/O, steep UV slope, compact size, and very high surface densities, closely mirror those of the brightest galaxies at z&gt;10, suggesting a shared evolutionary pathway.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Chaplygin Gas Models in Non-Minimally Coupled Power Law $f(Q)$ Gravity with Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where gravity emerges from non-metricity $Q$, we explore the cosmological implications of its non-minimal coupling to matter. Inspired by the recent success of Chaplygin gas models in explaining dark energy, we consider a background fluid composed of baryonic matter, radiation, and a family of Chaplygin gas variants namely Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG). We constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models from $\Lambda$CDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, $0.537^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ and $0.470^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ respectively, indicating a departure from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM). Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH contribution to the DM density by non-detection of their Hawking radiation's effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of DM as PBHs with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g, separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization sources on the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1\% of the total DM. We find that these constraints are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the swampland conjectures with DESI DR1 BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The swampland conjectures (SCs) propose constraints on effective field theories that can arise from a consistent theory of quantum gravity. Two prominent SCs suggest that the scalar field excursion and the gradient of the potential should be at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in Planck units. Using the first data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey and model-independent reconstructions of the SC-related quantities at late times, via a machine learning approach known as genetic algorithms, we evaluate the consistency of these reconstructions with the SC expectations. Our results indicate that the reconstructed second SC is several sigmas away from zero, suggesting a steep potential, in contrast to recent model-specific analyses assuming exponential potentials. The novelty of our approach lies in using solely model-independent reconstructions of cosmological observables from DESI, such as the angular diameter distance and the Hubble expansion history. This makes our method readily applicable to forthcoming data from stage IV surveys, providing a framework for further assessing consistency with SCs.</description>

      <title>The Giant Arc -- Filament or Figment?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions, and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.</description>

      <title>Clustering analysis of BOSS-CMASS galaxies with semi-analytical model for galaxy formation and halo occupation distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of massive and luminous galaxies have provided important constraints on the fundamental cosmological parameters and physical processes governing galaxy formation. In this work, we construct and compare independent galaxy-halo connection models in the application of clustering measurement at non-linear scales of BOSS-CMASS galaxies. In particular, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model with 11 parameters and a semi-analytical model (SAM) with 16 parameters to describe the galaxy two point correlation function. With an empirical parameterization for the velocity field to model the redshift space distortion effect and the emulator technique, we can explore the parameter space of both models. We find that the HOD model is able to recover the underlying velocity field of SAM with an accuracy of 3\%, and can be improved to 1\% when the analysis is restricted to scales above 1$h^{-1}$Mpc. The comparison is based on multiple samplings in the parameter space which can verify the convergence of the models. Then we perform constraints on the model parameters using clustering measurement of CMASS galaxies. Although limited by the emulator accuracy and the flexibility of the model, we find that the clustering measurement is capable of constraining a subset of the SAM parameters, especially for components sensitive to the star formation rate. This result leads us to anticipate that a joint analysis of both clustering and abundance measurements can significantly constrain the parameters of galaxy formation physics, which requires further investigation from both theoretical and observational aspects.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmological Expansion in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This is achieved by modelling sub-horizon regions of space-time as weak-field expansions around Minkowski space, and then subsequently joining many such regions together to create a statistically homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. We find that when the scalar field can be treated perturbatively, the cosmological behaviour that emerges is well modelled by the Friedmann solutions of the theory. When non-perturbative screening mechanisms occur this result no longer holds, and in the case of scalar fields subject to the chameleon mechanism we find significant deviations from the expected Friedmann behaviour. In particular, the screened mass no longer contributes to the Klein-Gordon equation, suppressing deviations from general relativistic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars I: A Demonstration in M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near-infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT $J$ and $K$-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{\rm F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim7.7\times10^{3}$ stars with $M_{\rm J} \lesssim -6$). We find that only $\sim1000$ AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially-resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{\rm M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^4$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's stellar halo $3-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-3$ Gyr ago; (ii) $M_{\star}\approx3_{-1}^{+5}\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim14$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of singlet-doublet dark matter relic: annihilation, co-annihilation, co-scattering, and freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02607v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The singlet-doublet vector-like fermion dark matter model has been extensively studied in the literature over the past decade. An important parameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\sin\theta$). All the previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation processes for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that the singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter. However, it badly fails for the mixing angle $\sin\theta&lt;0.05$. We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, non-thermal productions via the freeze-in and SuperWIMP mechanism are also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>Characterized behaviors of black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The comprehension of universal thermodynamic behaviors in the supercritical region is crucial for examining the characteristics of black hole systems under high temperature and pressure. This study is devoted to the analysis of characteristic lines and crossover behaviors within the supercritical region. By making use of the free energy, we introduce three key thermodynamic quantities: scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Our results demonstrate that the Widom line, associated with the maximal scaled variance, can effectively differentiate between small and large black hole-like subphases, each displaying distinct thermodynamic behaviors within the supercritical region. Furthermore, by utilizing quasinormal modes, we identify the Frenkel line, offering a dynamic perspective to distinguish between small and large black hole-like subphases. These contribute to a deeper comprehension of black hole subphases in the supercritical region, thus illuminating new facets of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxy halo masses from spectroscopic and photometric lensing in DESI and DES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the most precise and lowest-mass weak lensing measurements of dwarf galaxies to date, enabled by spectroscopic lenses from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and photometric lenses from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) calibrated with DESI redshifts. Using DESI spectroscopy from the first data release, we construct clean samples of galaxies with median stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.3-10.1$ and measure their weak lensing signals with sources from DES, KiDS, and SDSS, achieving detections with $S/N$ up to 14 for dwarf galaxies ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;$9.25) -- opening up a new regime for lensing measurements of low-mass systems. Leveraging DES photometry calibrated with DESI, we extend to a photometric dwarf sample of over 700,000 galaxies, enabling robust lensing detections of dwarf galaxies with combined $S/N=38$ and a significant measurement down to $\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot})=8.0$. We show that the one-halo regime (scales $\lesssim 0.15h^{-1}\rm Mpc$) is insensitive to various systematic and sample selection effects, providing robust halo mass estimates, while the signal in the two-halo regime depends on galaxy color and environment. These results demonstrate that DESI already enables precise dwarf lensing measurements, and that calibrated photometric samples extend this capability. Together, they pave the way for novel constraints on dwarf galaxy formation and dark matter physics with upcoming surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.</description>
