      <title>Temporally staggered cropping co-benefits beneficial insects and pest control globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconciling increasing food production with biodiversity conservation is critical yet challenging, particularly given global declines in beneficial insects driven by monoculture intensification. Intercropping, the simultaneous or sequential cultivation of multiple crops, has been proposed as a viable strategy to enhance beneficial insect services and suppress pests, yet global evidence regarding optimal spatiotemporal intercropping configurations remains fragmented. Here, we synthesize results from 7,584 field experiments spanning six continents and 22 Koppen climate regions, evaluating effects of spatial (row, strip, mixed, agroforestry) and temporal (additive, replacement, relay) intercropping configuations on beneficial insect (predators, parasitoids, pollinators) abundance and pest suppression using the Management Efficiency Ratio (MER; log ratio of abundance in intercropping versus monoculture). Relay intercropping, characterized by temporally staggered planting, emerged as the universally optimal temporal configuration, substantially increasing predator (MER = 0.473) and parasitoid populations (MER = 0.512) and effectively suppressing pests (MER = -0.611) globally. At regional scales, identical spatiotemporal configurations simultaneously optimized beneficial insect predator abundance and pest suppression in 57% of regions, while other regions required distinct, insect-specific approaches. Our findings highlight relay intercropping as a globally generalizable solution, but underscore regional variation that calls for targeted policies to simultaneously secure food production and biodiversity conservation.</description>

      <title>Parameter variability can produce heavy tails in a model for the spatial distribution of settling organisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a simple mechanistic model of spatial dispersal for settling organisms, subject to parameter variability, can generate heavy-tailed radial probability density functions. The movement of organisms in the model consists of a two-dimensional diffusion that ceases after a random time, where the parameters that characterize each of these stages have been randomized. Our findings show that these minimal assumptions can yield heavy-tailed dispersal patterns, providing a simplified framework that increases the understanding of long-distance dispersal events in movement ecology.</description>

      <title>Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA) Vectors can Identify Reticulation Events even in Multifurcated Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new vector encoding, Ordered Leaf Attachment (OLA), was introduced that represents $n$-leaf phylogenetic trees as $n-1$ length integer vectors by recording the placement location of each leaf. Both encoding and decoding of trees run in linear time and depend on a fixed ordering of the leaves. Here, we investigate the connection between OLA vectors and the maximum acyclic agreement forest (MAAF) problem. A MAAF represents an optimal breakdown of $k$ trees into reticulation-free subtrees, with the roots of these subtrees representing reticulation events. We introduce a corrected OLA distance index over OLA vectors of $k$ trees, which is easily computable in linear time. We prove that the corrected OLA distance corresponds to the size of a MAAF, given an optimal leaf ordering that minimizes that distance. Additionally, a MAAF can be easily reconstructed from optimal OLA vectors. We expand these results to multifurcated trees: we introduce an $O(kn \cdot m\log m)$ algorithm that optimally resolves a set of multifurcated trees given a leaf-ordering, where $m$ is the size of a largest multifurcation, and show that trees resolved via this algorithm also minimize the size of a MAAF. These results suggest a new approach to fast computation of phylogenetic networks and identification of reticulation events via random permutations of leaves. Additionally, in the case of microbial evolution, a natural ordering of leaves is often given by the sample collection date, which means that under mild assumptions, reticulation events can be identified in polynomial time on such datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effects of Over and Under Doses Antibiotic Treatment to Bacterial Resistance in Presence of Immune System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibiotic resistance presents a growing global health threat by diminishing the effectiveness of treatments and allowing once-manageable bacterial infections to persist. This study develops and analyzes an optimization-based mathematical model to investigate the impact of varying antibiotic dosages on bacterial resistance, incorporating the role of the immune system. Additionally, to capture the effects of over and underdosing, a floor function is newly introduced into the model as a switch function. The model is examined both analytically and numerically. As part of the analytical solution, the validity of the model through the existence and uniqueness theorem, stability at the equilibrium points, and characteristics of equilibrium points in relation to state variables have been investigated. Numerical simulations, performed using the Runge Kutta 4th order method, reveal that while antibiotics effectively reduce sensitive bacteria, they simultaneously increase resistant strains and suppress immune cell levels. The results also demonstrate that underdosing antibiotics increases the risk of resistance through bacterial mutation, while overdosing weakens the immune system by disrupting beneficial microbes. These findings emphasize that improper dosing whether below or above the prescribed level can accelerate the development of antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for carefully regulated treatment strategies that preserve both antimicrobial effectiveness and immune system integrity.</description>

      <title>Effective decoupling of mutations and the resulting loss of biodiversity caused by environmental change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17913v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally `best' trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling of nutrient-dependent biofilm growth on medical implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biofilm infections on medical implants are difficult to eradicate because insufficient nutrient availability promotes antibiotic-tolerant persister cells that survive treatment and reseed growth. Existing mathematical models usually omit nutrient-dependent phenotypic switching between proliferative and persister states. Without this mechanism, models cannot capture how environmental conditions control the balance between active growth and dormancy, which is central to biofilm persistence. We present a continuum model that couples nutrient transport with the dynamics of proliferative bacteria, persisters, dead cells, and extracellular polymeric substances. The switching rates between proliferative and persister phenotypes depend on local nutrient concentration through two thresholds, enabling adaptation across nutrient-poor, intermediate, and nutrient-rich regimes. Simulations show that nutrient limitation produces a high and sustained proportion of persister cells even when biomass is reduced, whereas nutrient-rich conditions support reversion to proliferative growth and lead to greater biomass. The model also predicts that persister populations peak at times that vary with nutrient availability, and these peaks coincide with turning points in biofilm growth, identifying critical intervention windows. By directly linking nutrient availability to phenotypic switching, our model reveals mechanisms of biofilm persistence that earlier models could not capture, and it points toward strategies that target nutrient-driven adaptation as a means to improve the control of implant-associated infections.</description>

      <title>A game played by tandem-running ants: Hint of procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation through narrow passages during colony relocation by the tandem-running ants, $\textit{Diacamma}$ $\textit{indicum}$, is a tour de force of biological traffic coordination. Even on one-lane paths, the ants tactfully manage a bidirectional flow: Informed individuals (termed leaders) guide nest-mates (termed followers) from a suboptimal nest to a new optimal nest, and then return to recruit additional followers. We propose that encounters between the ants moving in opposite directions can be modelled within the framework of game theory leading to an understanding of the mechanism behind observed behaviours. Our experiments reveal that, upon encountering a tandem pair (a leader and its follower) on a narrow path, the returning leader reverses her direction and proceeds toward the new nest again as if she becomes the leader guiding a follower. This observed behaviour is consistent with game-theoretic predictions, provided the assumption of perfect rationality is relaxed in favour of bounded rationality -- specifically, procedural rationality. In other words, the experimental outcomes are consistent with sampling equilibrium but not with Nash equilibrium. Our work, which strives to induct the essence of behavioural game theory into the world of ants, is first ever report of realizing sampling equilibrium in scenarios not involving human players.</description>

      <title>Adaptive mechanical proofreading toward faithful clonal selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To ensure faithful information transmission, cells utilize nonequilibrium drives to reduce errors. Kinetic proofreading is a classic mechanism known to sharpen ligand discrimination by T lymphocytes. It remains an open question whether the adaptive immune system relies solely on kinetic proofreading to boost fidelity. Here, we suggest an alternative: an enhanced form of mechanical proofreading (MPR) in which adaptive force exertion via dynamic cell-cell contact allows faithful selection of high-affinity B lymphocytes. Using a minimal model validated with experiment, we show that adaptive MPR, characterized by mechanical feedback between force generation and contact formation, enables robust discrimination of receptor quality regardless of ligand quantity. Although MPR generically balances the tradeoffs between speed and fidelity, a negative scaling of contact duration with ligand abundance indicates the presence of feedback. Due to its ability to modulate interactions of distinct ligands that share load at membrane contacts, adaptive MPR can be harnessed to mitigate autoimmunity or enhance multivalent vaccines. Overall, this work suggests a generalization of the proofreading mechanism to encompass cellular designs that act across scales to enable competing functionalities.</description>

      <title>Social influence on complex networks as a perturbation to individual behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17948v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to the functioning of biological and social systems in both human and animal populations, with the structure of interactions playing a crucial role. Previous studies have used networks to describe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with limited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant assumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not derived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting cooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the context of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor either cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even if neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for deriving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any network structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent exogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally prohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring cooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit, establishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism for cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative, and network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific network properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and evolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions generalize to any decision-making process involving a choice between alternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to non-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation science in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased processes within structured interactions are abundant.</description>

      <title>Tikhonov-Fenichel Reductions and their Application to a Novel Modelling Approach for Mutualism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When formulating a model there is a trade-off between model complexity and (biological) realism. In the present paper we demonstrate how model reduction from a precise mechanistic "super model" to simpler conceptual models using Tikhonov--Fenichel reductions, an algebraic approach to singular perturbation theory, can mitigate this problem. Compared to traditional methods for time scale separations (Tikhonov's theorem, quasi-steady state assumption), Tikhonov--Fenichel reductions have the advantage that we can compute a reduction directly for a separation of rates into slow and fast ones instead of a separation of components of the system. Moreover, we can find all such eductions algorithmically. In this work we use Tikhonov--Fenichel reductions to analyse a mutualism model tailored towards lichens with an explicit description of the interaction. We find: (1) the implicit description of the interaction given in the reductions by interaction terms (functional responses) varies depending on the scenario, (2) there is a tendency for the Mycobiont, an obligate mutualist, to always benefit from the interaction while it can be detrimental for the photobiont, a facultative mutualist, depending on the parameters, (3) our model is capable of describing the shift from mutualism to parasitism, (4) via numerical analyis, that our model experiences bistability with multiple stable fixed points in the interior of the first orthant. To analyse the reductions we formalize and discuss a mathematical criterion that categorizes two-species interactions. Throughout the paper we focus on the relation between the mathematics behind Tikhonov--Fenichel reductions and their biological interpretation.</description>

      <title>Expand or better manage protected areas: a framework for minimizing extinction risk when threats are concentrated near edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several international agreements have called for the rapid expansion of protected areas to halt biodiversity declines. However, recent research has shown that expanding protected areas may be less cost-effective than redirecting resources towards threat management in existing reserves. These findings often assume that threats are homogeneously distributed in the landscape. In some cases, threats are more concentrated near the edge of protected areas. As protected areas expand, core habitat in the centre expands more rapidly than its edge, potentially creating a refuge from threats. In this paper, we present a framework linking protected area expansion and threat management to extinction risk, via their impact on population carrying capacity and growth rate within core and edge habitats. We demonstrate the framework using a simple population model where individuals are uniformly distributed in a circular protected area threatened by poachers who penetrate the protected area to a fixed distance. We parameterise the model for Peter's Duiker (Cephalophus callipygus) harvested for food in the dense undergrowth of African forests using snares. Expanding protected areas can reduce extinction risk more effectively compared to an equivalent investment in snare removal for larger protected areas that already sustain core unhunted habitat. Our results demonstrate the importance of protected area expansion in buffering susceptible populations from fixed hunting pressure restricted to protected area edges. However, for cases where threats, wildlife, and managers respond to each other strategically in space, the relative importance of expansion versus increased management remains a significant open problem.</description>

      <title>Bounding the SNPR distance between two tree-child networks using generalised agreement forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agreement forests continue to play a central role in the comparison of phylogenetic trees since their introduction more than 25 years ago. More specifically, they are used to characterise several distances that are based on tree rearrangement operations and related quantifiers of dissimilarity between phylogenetic trees. In addition, the concept of agreement forests continues to underlie most advancements in the development of algorithms that exactly compute the aforementioned measures. In this paper, we introduce agreement digraphs, a concept that generalises agreement forests for two phylogenetic trees to two phylogenetic networks. Analogous to the way in which agreement forests compute the subtree prune and regraft distance between two phylogenetic trees but inherently more complex, we then use agreement digraphs to bound the subnet prune and regraft distance between two tree-child networks from above and below and show that our bounds are tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend reconstruction methods for phylogenetic trees to ultrametrics of arbitrary matroids and study the stability of these data analysis methods in the combinatorial spirit of Andreas Dress. In particular, we generalize Atteson's work on the safety radius of phylogenetic reconstruction methods, as well as Gascuel and Steel's work on the stochastic safety radius, to arbitrary matroids. We also show that although the tropical Fermat-Weber points of an $M$-ultrametric sample are generally not contained in the space of $M$-ultrametrics, the intersection between the Fermat-Weber set and the space of $M$-ultrametrics is non-empty.</description>
