      <title>Predicting Readiness to Engage in Psychotherapy of People with Chronic Pain Based on their Pain-Related Narratives Saar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Chronic pain afflicts 20 % of the global population. A strictly biomedical mind-set leaves many sufferers chasing somatic cures and has fuelled the opioid crisis. The biopsychosocial model recognises pain subjective, multifactorial nature, yet uptake of psychosocial care remains low. We hypothesised that patients own pain narratives would predict their readiness to engage in psychotherapy.
  Methods. In a cross-sectional pilot, 24 chronic-pain patients recorded narrated pain stories on Painstory.science. Open questions probed perceived pain source, interference and influencing factors. Narratives were cleaned, embedded with a pretrained large-language model and entered into machine-learning classifiers that output ready/not ready probabilities.
  Results. The perception-domain model achieved 95.7 % accuracy (specificity = 0.80, sensitivity = 1.00, AUC = 0.90). The factors-influencing-pain model yielded 83.3 % accuracy (specificity = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.90, AUC = 0.75). Sentence count correlated with readiness for perception narratives (r = 0.54, p &lt; .01) and factor narratives (r = 0.24, p &lt; .05).
  Conclusion. Brief spoken pain narratives carry reliable signals of willingness to start psychosocial treatment. NLP-based screening could help clinicians match chronic-pain patients to appropriate interventions sooner, supporting a patient-centred biopsychosocial pathway.</description>

      <title>Modulating task outcome value to mitigate real-world procrastination via noninvasive brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procrastination represents one of the most prevalent behavioral problems affecting individual health and societal productivity. Although it is often conceptualized as a form of self-control failure, its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are poorly understood. A leading model posits that procrastination arises from imbalanced competing motivations: the avoidance of negative task aversiveness and the pursuit of positive task outcomes, yet this theoretical framework has not fully validated in real-world settings and not applied effectively to guide interventions. Here, we addressed this gap with a preregistered, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. We applied seven sessions of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key region for self-control, in chronic procrastinators. Using the intensive experience sampling method (iESM), we assessed the effect of anodal HD-tDCS on real-world procrastination behavior at offline after-effect (2-day interval) and long-term retention (6-month follow-up). We found that this neuromodulation produced a lasting reduction in real-world procrastination, with effects sustained at a 6-month follow-up. While the intervention both decreased task aversiveness and increased perceived task outcome value, causal mediation analysis revealed a striking mechanism: the increase in task outcome value uniquely and sufficiently mediated the entire behavioral improvement. In conclusion, these findings provide causal evidence that enhancing DLPFC function mitigates procrastination by selectively amplifying the valuation of future rewards, not by simply reducing negative feelings about the task. This establishes a precise, value-driven neurocognitive pathway for self-control and offers a validated, theory-driven strategy for intervention.</description>

      <title>Amortizing personalization in virtual brain twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual brain twins are personalized digital models of individual human subject or patient's brains, allowing for mechanistic interpretation of neuroimaging data features. Training and inference with these models however presents a pair of challenges: large shared infrastructure do not allow for use of personal data and inference in clinical applications should not require significant resources. We introduce "anonymized personalization" to address both by expanding model priors to include personalization which under amortized inference allows training to be performed anonymously, while inference is both personalized and lightweight. We illustrate the basic approach, demonstrate reliability in an example, and discuss the impact on both experimental and computational neuroscience.

      <title>Wirelessly transmitted subthalamic nucleus signals predict endogenous pain levels in Parkinson's disease patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) patients experience pain fluctuations that significantly reduce their quality of life. Despite the vast knowledge of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in PD, the STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations and the relationship between bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) activities and pain occurrence are still less understood. This observational study used data-driven methods by collecting annotated pain followed by a series of corresponding binary pain ratings and wirelessly transmitted STN signals, then leveraging the explainable machine learning algorithm to predict binary pain levels and sort the feature influence. The binary pain levels could be predicted among annotated pain reports corresponding to PD-related pain characteristics. The STN activity from both sides could impact pain prediction, with gamma and beta bands in the contralateral STN and delta and theta bands in the ipsilateral STN showing a prominent role. This study emphasizes the role of bilateral STN biomarkers on endogenous pain fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The assumptions that restrain us from understanding consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The science of consciousness has been successful over the last decades. Yet, it seems that some of the key questions remain unanswered. Perhaps, as a science of consciousness, we cannot move forward using the same theoretical commitments that brought us here. It might be necessary to revise some assumptions we have made along the way. In this piece, I offer no answers, but I will question some of these fundamental assumptions. We will try to take a fresh look at the classical question about the neural and explanatory correlates of consciousness. A key assumption is that neural correlates are to be found at the level of spiking responses. However, perhaps we should not simply take it for granted that this assumption holds true. Another common assumption is that we are close to understanding the computations underlying consciousness. I will try to show that computations related to consciousness might be far more complex than our current theories envision. There is little reason to think that consciousness is an abstract computation, as traditionally believed. Furthermore, I will try to demonstrate that consciousness research could benefit from investigating internal changes of consciousness, such as aha-moments. Finally, I will ask which theories the science of consciousness really needs.</description>

      <title>Brain2Model Transfer: Training sensory and decision models with human neural activity as a teacher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning enhances the training of novel sensory and decision models by employing rich feature representations from large, pre-trained teacher models. Cognitive neuroscience shows that the human brain creates low-dimensional, abstract representations for efficient sensorimotor coding. Importantly, the brain can learn these representations with significantly fewer data points and less computational power than artificial models require. We introduce Brain2Model Transfer Learning (B2M), a framework where neural activity from human sensory and decision-making tasks acts as the teacher model for training artificial neural networks. We propose two B2M strategies: (1) Brain Contrastive Transfer, which aligns brain activity and network activations through a contrastive objective; and (2) Brain Latent Transfer, which projects latent dynamics from similar cognitive tasks onto student networks via supervised regression of brain-derived features. We validate B2M in memory-based decision-making with a recurrent neural network and scene reconstruction for autonomous driving with a variational autoencoder. The results show that student networks benefiting from brain-based transfer converge faster and achieve higher predictive accuracy than networks trained in isolation. Our findings indicate that the brain's representations are valuable for artificial learners, paving the way for more efficient learning of complex decision-making representations, which would be costly or slow through purely artificial training.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without background knowledge on convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problem for Multi-armed Bandits via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of multi-armed bandits (IMAB) that are widely used in neuroscience and psychology research for behavior modelling. We first show that the IMAB problem is not convex in general, but can be relaxed to a convex problem via variable transformation. Based on this result, we propose a two-step sequential heuristic for (approximately) solving the IMAB problem. We discuss a condition where our method provides global solution to the IMAB problem with certificate, as well as approximations to further save computing time. Numerical experiments indicate that our heuristic method is more robust than directly solving the IMAB problem via repeated local optimization, and can achieve the performance of Monte Carlo methods within a significantly decreased running time. We provide the implementation of our method based on CVXPY, which allows straightforward application by users not well versed in convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Revealing higher-order neural representations of uncertainty with the Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order" representations (HORs), which are ``about" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.</description>
