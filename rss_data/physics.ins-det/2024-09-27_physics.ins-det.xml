      <title>High-count-rate Particle Tracking in Proton and Carbon Radiotherapy with Timepix2 Operated in Ultra-Short Acquisition Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the operational acquisition time limits of Timepix3 and Timepix2 detectors operated in frame mode for high-count rate of high deposited energy transfer particles. Measurements were performed using alpha particles from a 241Am laboratory source and proton and carbon ion beams from a synchrotron accelerator. The particle count rate upper limit is determined by overlapping per-pixel particle signals, identifiable by the hits per pixel counter &gt; 2, indicating the need to decrease acquisition time. On the other hand, the lower limit is the time required to collect the particle deposited charge while maintaining spectral properties. Different acquisition times were evaluated for an AdvaPIX Timepix3 detector (500 um Silicon sensor) with standard per-pixel DAC settings and a Minipix Timepix2 detector (300 um Silicon sensor) with standard and customized settings the pulse shaping parameter and threshold. For AdvaPIX Timepix3, spectra remained accurate down to 100 us frame acquisition time; at 10 us, loss of collected charge occurred, suggesting either avoiding this acquisition time or applying a correction. Timepix2 allowed acquisition times down to 100 ns for single particle track measurements even for high energy loss, enabled by a new Timepix2 feature delaying shutter closure until full particle charge collection. This work represents the first measurement utilizing Timepix-chips pixel detectors in an accelerator beam of clinical energy and intensity without the need to decrease the beam current. This is made possible by exploiting the short shutter feature in Timepix2 and a customized per-pixel energy calibration of the Timepix2 detector with a larger discharging signal value which allowed for a shorter time-over-threshold (ToT) signal. These customized settings extend the operation of the pixel detectors to higher event rates up to 10^9 particles/cm^2/s.</description>

      <title>TCAD Simulation of Stitching for Passive CMOS Strip Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the tracking detectors for high energy particle experiments are filled with silicon detectors since they are radiation hard, they can give very small spatial resolution and they can take advantage of the silicon electronics foundries developments and production lines.
  Strip detectors are very useful to cover large areas for tracking purposes, while consuming less power per area compared to pixel sensors. The majority of particle physics experiments use conventional silicon strip detectors fabricated in foundries that do not use stitching, relying on a very small number of foundries worldwide that can provide large amounts of strip detectors. Fabricating strip detectors in a CMOS foundry opens the possibility to use more foundries and to include active elements in the strips for future productions. For the passive CMOS strip detectors project we fabricated strip detectors in a CMOS foundry using two 1 cm2 reticles that are stitched together along the wafer. The fabricated strips stitched the reticles three and five times, and it was shown that the performance of those strips is not affected by the stitching.
  This paper shows 3D TCAD simulations of the stitching area to investigate the possible effects stitching can have on the performance of the strip detectors, considering different stitching mismatches. We will show that the mismatch of stitched structures up to 1 um does not impact the performance with TCAD simulations which agrees with the results obtained from the measurements.</description>

      <title>Contribution of gaseous tritium source rear wall to tritium beta-spectrum in Troitsk nu-mass experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We avaluate the contribution of electron scattering on the rear wall of a windowless gaseous tritium source in the Troitsk nu-mass setup. There is a finite probability for them to scatter, return back and reach the detector. A such additional component distorts the measured electron spectrum. We calculate the scattering on the rear side of the vacuum pipe by the GEANT4 simulation and trace the electrons back through the magnetic fields to the spectrometer and registration system. The contribution is a few orders of magnitude smaller compared to the original spectrum at the end of the beta-spectrum of 18.6 keV but reaches 2\% at 11 keV. Taking into account this rear wall scattering we can fit well the measured spectrum in search for a sterile neutrino component in the tritium beta decay.</description>

      <title>Retinal arterial blood flow measured by real-time Doppler holography at 33,000 frames per second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel quantitative estimation method for total retinal arterial blood flow utilizing real-time Doppler holography at an unprecedented frame rate of 33,000 frames per second. This technique, leveraging high-speed digital holography, enables non-invasive angiographic imaging of the retina, providing detailed blood flow contrasts essential for assessing retinal health. The proposed quantitative analysis method consists of segmenting primary in-plane retinal arteries and calculating local blood velocity using Doppler frequency broadening. The analysis integrates a forward scattering model to achieve blood flow estimation. Our findings highlight the potential of Doppler holography as a powerful tool for diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of retinal vascular conditions, complementary to existing imaging methods.</description>

      <title>Enhancing non-destructive mass identification via Fourier-transform fluorescence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-ion mass identification is important for atomic and nuclear physics experiments on ions produced with low yields. Cooling the ion to ultra-low temperatures by interacting with a laser-cooled ion will enhance the precision of the measurements. In this paper we present axial-common-mode frequency measurements of balanced and unbalanced Coulomb crystals from the Fourier transform of the fluorescence photons from a Doppler-cooling transition in calcium ions, after probing the ion/crystal with a 5-radiofrequency comb. A single ion non-destructively detected can be used for identification yielding a mass resolving power $m/\Delta m_\mathrm{FWHM}\approx 310$ from the axial common mode. This identification can be performed from a single measurement within times below one second.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3~kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Secondary Emission of Single Photon Avalanche Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-area next-generation physics experiments rely on using Silicon Photo-Multiplier (SiPM) devices to detect single photons, which trigger charge avalanches. The noise mechanism of external cross-talk occurs when secondary photons produced during a charge avalanche escape from an SiPM and trigger other devices within a detector system. This work presents measured spectra of the secondary photons emitted from the Hamamatsu VUV4 and Fondazione Bruno Kessler VUV-HD3 SiPMs stimulated by laser light, near operational voltages. The work describes the Microscope for the Injection and Emission of Light (MIEL) setup, which is an experimental apparatus constructed for this purpose. Measurements have been performed at a range of over-voltage values and temperatures from 86~K to 293~K. The number of photons produced per avalanche at the source are calculated from the measured spectra and determined to be 40$\pm$9 and 61$\pm$11 photons produced per avalanche for the VUV4 and VUV-HD3 respectively at 4 volts over-voltage. No significant temperature dependence is observed within the measurement uncertainties. The overall number of photons emitted per avalanche from each SiPM device are also reported.</description>

Abstract: A previously unexplained background called the Low Energy Excess (LEE) has negatively impacted the reach of a variety of low threshold calorimeters including light dark matter direct detection and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments. The relaxation of stressed aluminium films as mediated by the motion of dislocations may account for these observations.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance is revolutionizing in parallel with the development of methodology and all electronics and hardware around it. The primary objective of such modifications is to make the system more reliable and sensitive. Almost a decade ago, Bruker introduced an Avance NEO console with an extended dynamic range of the receiver gain (RG). The system offered a maximum sensitivity even at very low RG. This feature is handy in the case of hyperpolarization when too much signal can cause clipping of the free induction decay signal. We analyzed the RG profile for our spectrometer's 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei and found nonmonotonous sensitivity behavior characterized by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, 13C SNR at RG = 18 is 5.5% higher than SNR at maximum RG = 101 and 51.6% higher than at RG = 20.2. Having found this, we advertise here that other NMR users with any spectrometers should calibrate their SNR vs. RG and find the RG value right for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not know about the actual performance of each system. We offer a tool and strategy for such an optimization and exemplify the benefits of using SNR-adjusted RG value with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate measurements.</description>

      <title>Design and commissioning of a high-level control system for a medical isochronous cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MEDICYC (MEDical CYClotron) is an isochronous cyclotron dedicated to radiotherapy which was built and commissioned in Nice, France, in 1990 by a local team aided by experts from CERN. The cyclotron accelerates negative H to a maximum energy of 65 MeV and uses stripping to extract a proton beam. Its primary purpose is treating ocular melanoma by protontherapy but a significant research activity is also present on beam-lines dedicated for this purpose. An extensive refurbishment program of the cyclotron has been started to cope with the end-of-life and/or the obsolescence of several sub-systems. In this context, a new high-level cyclotron control system has been developed and commissioned in 2021-2024. The primary responsibility of the system is the high-level coordination of the source, the RF system, the beam-line and cyclotron magnets, to produce and deliver a beam with a given set of characteristics. A secondary responsibility is the collection, visualization and analysis of sub-system and beam data for monitoring and pre-emptive fault detection. In this contribution, the control system software architecture is presented and the infrastructure on which the systems are deployed is laid out.</description>
