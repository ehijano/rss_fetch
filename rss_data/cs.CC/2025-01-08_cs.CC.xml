      <title>Inverse Intersections for Boolean Satisfiability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems are expressed as mathematical formulas. This paper presents an alternative matrix representation for any type of these SAT problems. It shows how to use this matrix representation to get the full set of valid assignments. It proves that this is the full set of answers for the given problem, and it shows that this is exponential in size, relative to the matrix. It then presents an algorithm that utilizes the inverses of the clauses in this matrix for faster searching through this set of answers. It shows that this algorithm is both correct and polynomial.</description>

      <title>On complexity of restricted fragments of Decision DNNF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision DNNF (a.k.a. $\wedge_d$-FBDD) is an important special case of Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF). Decision DNNF admits FPT sized representation of CNFs of bounded \emph{primal} treewidth. However, the complexity of representation for CNFs of bounded \emph{incidence} treewidth is wide open.
  In the main part of this paper we carry out an in-depth study of the $\wedge_d$-OBDD model. We formulate a generic methodology for proving lower bounds for the model. Using this methodology, we reestablish the XP lower bound provided in [arxiv:1708.07767]. We also provide exponential separations between FBDD and $\wedge_d$-OBDD and between $\wedge_d$-OBDD and an ordinary OBDD. The last separation is somewhat surprising since $\wedge_d$-FBDD can be quasipolynomially simulated by FBDD.
  In the remaining part of the paper, we introduce a relaxed version of Structured Decision DNNF that we name Structured $\wedge_d$-FBDD. We demonstrate that this model is quite powerful for CNFs of bounded incidence treewidth: it has an FPT representation for CNFs that can be turned into ones of bounded primal treewidth by removal of a constant number of clauses (while for both $\wedge_d$-OBDD and Structured Decision DNNF an XP lower bound is triggered by just two long clauses).</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Segment Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment Routing is a recent network technology that helps optimizing network throughput by providing finer control over the routing paths. Instead of routing directly from a source to a target, packets are routed via intermediate waypoints. Between consecutive waypoints, the packets are routed according to traditional shortest path routing protocols. Bottlenecks in the network can be avoided by such rerouting, preventing overloading parts of the network. The associated NP-hard computational problem is Segment Routing: Given a network on $n$ vertices, $d$ traffic demands (vertex pairs), and a (small) number $k$, the task is to find for each demand pair at most $k$ waypoints such that with shortest path routing along these waypoints, all demands are fulfilled without exceeding the capacities of the network. We investigate if special structures of real-world communication networks could be exploited algorithmically. Our results comprise NP-hardness on graphs with constant treewidth even if only one waypoint per demand is allowed. We further exclude (under standard complexity assumptions) algorithms with running time $f(d) n^{g(k)}$ for any functions $f$ and $g$. We complement these lower bounds with polynomial-time solvable special cases.</description>

      <title>On Approximate Reconfigurability of Label Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08746v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a two-prover game $G$ and its two satisfying labelings $\psi_\mathsf{ini}$ and $\psi_\mathsf{tar}$, the Label Cover Reconfiguration problem asks whether $\psi_\mathsf{ini}$ can be transformed into $\psi_\mathsf{tar}$ by repeatedly changing the label of a single vertex while preserving any intermediate labeling satisfying $G$. We consider its optimization version by relaxing the feasibility of labelings, referred to as Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration: We are allowed to pass through any non-satisfying labelings, but required to maximize the ``soundness error,'' which is defined as the minimum fraction of satisfied edges during transformation from $\psi_\mathsf{ini}$ to $\psi_\mathsf{tar}$. Since the parallel repetition theorem of Raz (SIAM J. Comput., 1998), which implies $\mathbf{NP}$-hardness of approximating Label Cover within any constant factor, gives strong inapproximability results for many $\mathbf{NP}$-hard problems, one may think of using Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration to derive inapproximability results for reconfiguration problems. We prove the following results on Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration, which display different trends from those of Label Cover and the parallel repetition theorem:
  $\bullet$ Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration can be approximated within a factor of $\frac{1}{4} - o(1)$ for some restricted graph classes, including biregular graphs, balanced bipartite graphs with no isolated vertices, and superconstant average degree graphs.
  $\bullet$ A ``naive'' parallel repetition of Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration does not decrease the soundness error for every two-prover game.
  $\bullet$ Label Cover Reconfiguration on projection games can be decided in polynomial time.
  Our results suggest that a reconfiguration analogue of the parallel repetition theorem is unlikely.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of sum-of-squares bounds for copositive programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, copositive programming has received significant attention for its ability to model hard problems in both discrete and continuous optimization. Several relaxations of copositive programs based on semidefinite programming (SDP) have been proposed in the literature, meant to provide tractable bounds. However, while these SDP-based relaxations are amenable to the ellipsoid algorithm and interior point methods, it is not immediately obvious that they can be solved in polynomial time (even approximately). In this paper, we consider the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies of relaxations for copositive programs introduced by Parrilo (2000), de Klerk &amp; Pasechnik (2002) and Pe\~na, Vera &amp; Zuluaga (2006), which can be formulated as SDPs. We establish sufficient conditions that guarantee the polynomial-time computability (up to fixed precision) of these relaxations. These conditions are satisfied by copositive programs that represent standard quadratic programs and their reciprocals. As an application, we show that the SOS bounds for the (weighted) stability number of a graph can be computed efficiently. Additionally, we provide pathological examples of copositive programs (that do not satisfy the sufficient conditions) whose SOS relaxations admit only feasible solutions of doubly-exponential size.</description>

      <title>Structures preserved by primitive actions of $S_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dichotomy for structures $A$ that are preserved by primitive actions of $S_{\omega} = \text{Sym}({\mathbb N})$: either such a structure interprets all finite structures primitively positively, or it is of a very simple form and in particular has a binary polymorphism $f$ and an automorphism $\alpha$ satisfying $f(x,y) = \alpha(f(y,x))$. It is a consequence of our results that the constraint satisfaction problem for $A$ is in P or NP-complete.
  To prove our result, we study the first-order reducts of the Johnson graph $J(k)$, for $k \geq 2$, whose automorphism group $G$ equals the action of $S_{\omega}$ on the set $V$ of $k$-element subsets of $\mathbb N$. We use the fact that $J(k)$ has a finitely bounded homogeneous Ramsey expansion and that $G$ is a maximal closed subgroup of $\text{Sym}(V)$.</description>

      <title>Algorithmically Optimal Outer Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.08468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between algorithmic fractal dimensions and the classical local fractal dimensions of outer measures in Euclidean spaces. We introduce global and local optimality conditions for lower semicomputable outer measures. We prove that globally optimal outer measures exist. Our main theorem states that the classical local fractal dimensions of any locally optimal outer measure coincide exactly with the algorithmic fractal dimensions. Our proof uses an especially convenient locally optimal outer measure $\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ defined in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. We discuss implications for point-to-set principles.</description>

      <title>Reduction from the partition problem: Dynamic lot sizing problem with polynomial complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we polynomially reduce an instance of the partition problem to a dynamic lot sizing problem, and show that solving the latter problem solves the former problem. By solving the dynamic programming formulation of the dynamic lot sizing problem, we show that the instance of the partition problem can be solved with pseudo-polynomial time complexity. Numerical results on solving instances of the partition problem are also provided using an implementation of the algorithm that solves the dynamic program.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Linear Arc Monadic Datalog and Gadget Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Datalog program solves a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) if and only if it derives the goal predicate precisely on the unsatisfiable instances of the CSP.
  There are three Datalog fragments that are particularly important for finite-domain constraint satisfaction: arc monadic Datalog, linear Datalog, and symmetric linear Datalog, each having good computational properties. We consider the fragment of Datalog where we impose all of these restrictions simultaneously, i.e., we study \emph{symmetric linear arc monadic (slam) Datalog}. We characterise the CSPs that can be solved by a slam Datalog program as those that have a gadget reduction to a particular Boolean constraint satisfaction problem. We also present exact characterisations in terms of a homomorphism duality (which we call \emph{unfolded caterpillar duality}), and in universal-algebraic terms (using known minor conditions, namely the existence of quasi Maltsev operations and $k$-absorptive operations of arity $nk$}, for all $n,k \geq 1$). Our characterisations also imply that the question whether a given finite-domain CSP can be expressed by a slam Datalog program is decidable.</description>

      <title>QMA vs. QCMA and Pseudorandomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14416v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a longstanding question of Aaronson and Kuperberg on whether there exists a classical oracle separating $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$. Settling this question in either direction would yield insight into the power of quantum proofs over classical proofs. We show that such an oracle exists if a certain quantum pseudorandomness conjecture holds. Roughly speaking, the conjecture posits that quantum algorithms cannot, by making few queries, distinguish between the uniform distribution over permutations versus permutations drawn from so-called "dense" distributions.
  Our result can be viewed as establishing a "win-win" scenario: either there is a classical oracle separation of $\mathsf{QMA}$ from $\mathsf{QCMA}$, or there is quantum advantage in distinguishing pseudorandom distributions on permutations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given a graph G we can CMSO-transduce its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant MSO, a strictly more expressive logic than CMSO. Our methods more generally yield C2MSO-transductions of the canonical decomposition of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>
