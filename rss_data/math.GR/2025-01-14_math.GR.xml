      <title>The large scale geometry of inverse semigroups and their maximal group images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of inverse semigroups is a natural topic of study, motivated both from within semigroup theory and by applications to the theory of non-commutative $C^*$-algebras. We study the relationship between the geometry of an inverse semigroup and that of its maximal group image, and in particular the geometric \textit{distortion} of the natural map from the former to the latter. This turns out to have both implications for semigroup theory and potential relevance for operator algebras associated to inverse semigroups. Along the way, we also answer a question of Lled\'{o} and Mart\'{i}nez by providing a more direct proof that an $E$-unitary inverse semigroup has Yu's Property A if its maximal group image does.</description>

      <title>Left reductive regular semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an ideal structure theory for the class of left reductive regular semigroups and apply it to several subclasses of popular interest. In these classes, we observe that the right ideal structure of the semigroup is `embedded' inside the left ideal one, and so we can construct these semigroups starting with only one object (unlike in other more general cases). To this end, we introduce an upgraded version of the Nambooripad's normal category \cite{cross} as our building block, which we call a \emph{connected category}.
  The main theorem of the paper describes a category equivalence between the category of left reductive regular semigroups and the category of {connected categories}. Then, we specialise our result to describe constructions of $\gl$-unipotent semigroups, right regular bands, inverse semigroups and arbitrary regular monoids. Exploiting the left-right duality of semigroups, we also construct right reductive regular semigroups and use that to describe the more particular subclasses of $\gr$-unipotent semigroups and left regular bands. Finally, we provide concrete (and rather simple) descriptions to the connected categories that arise from finite transformation semigroups, linear transformation semigroups (over a finite dimensional vector space) and symmetric inverse monoids.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology and scl of verbal wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a countable group $A$ with trivial bounded cohomology for all semi-separable coefficients and any group $\Gamma$, we prove that the bounded cohomology of certain restricted verbal wreath products $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes in positive degrees, for all semi-separable coefficients. Examples of such verbal wreath products include the standard restricted wreath product (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups) as well as verbal wreath products arising from $n$-solvable, $n$-nilpotent and $k$-Burnside ($k = 2,3,4,6$) verbal products. As an application, we show that every group of type $F_p$ isometrically embeds into a group of type $F_p$ with vanishing bounded cohomology in degree $n\geq 1$ for all semi-separable coefficients. Finally, we prove that the stable commutator length of any verbal wreath product $\Gamma \wr^{_W} A$ vanishes.</description>

      <title>Continuous spectrum-shrinking maps and applications to preserver problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$ let $\mathcal{X}_n$ be either the algebra $M_n$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices, the set $N_n$ of all $n \times n$ normal matrices, or any of the matrix Lie groups $\mathrm{GL}(n)$, $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{U}(n)$. We first give a short and elementary argument that for two positive integers $m$ and $n$ there exists a continuous spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_m$ (i.e.\ $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(X))\subseteq \mathrm{sp}(X)$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$. Moreover, in that case we have the equality of characteristic polynomials $k_{\phi(X)}(\cdot) = k_{X}(\cdot)^\frac{m}{n}$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$, which in particular shows that $\phi$ preserves spectra. Using this we show that whenever $n \geq 3$, any continuous commutativity preserving and spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_n$ is of the form $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)T^{-1}$ or $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)^tT^{-1}$, for some $T\in \mathrm{GL}(n)$. The analogous results fail for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(n)$, and slightly more elaborate versions hold for the spaces of semisimple elements in either $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n)$, where a qualitatively new (and surprising) phenomenon arises: the map sending $SNS^{-1}$ to $S^{-1}NS$ for positive invertible $S$ and normal $N$ is also an example. As a consequence, we also recover (a strengthened version of) \v{S}emrl's influential characterization of Jordan automorphisms of $M_n$ via preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Spaces of subgroups of toral groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space of conjugacy classes of subgroups of a compact Lie group G whose identity component is a torus, and consider how various invariants of subgroups behave as sheaves over this space. This feeds in to the author's programme to give algebraic models of rational G-equivariant cohomology theories.
  The methods are illustrated by making the outcome explicit for all toral subgroups of compact connected rank 2 groups.</description>

      <title>The Lodha--Moore groups and their $n$-adic generalizations are not SCY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07522v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A closed 4-manifold is symplectic Calabi--Yau (SCY) if its canonical class is trivial. Friedl and Vidussi proved that Thompson's group $F$ cannot be the fundamental group of any SCY manifold. In this paper, we show that its generalizations, called the Brown--Thompson group and the $n$-adic Lodha--Moore groups, cannot be also the fundamental group of any SCY manifold by using their method. From this proof, we also show that there exist non-trivial infinitely many examples which satisfy Geoghegan's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Dual structures on Coxeter and Artin groups of rank three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of dual Coxeter and Artin groups to all rank-three Coxeter systems, beyond the previously studied spherical and affine cases. Using geometric, combinatorial, and topological techniques, we show that rank-three noncrossing partition posets are EL-shellable lattices and give rise to Garside groups isomorphic to the associated standard Artin groups. Within this framework, we prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture, the triviality of the center, and the solubility of the word problem for rank-three Artin groups. Some of our constructions apply to general Artin groups; we hope they will help develop complete solutions to the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture and other open problems in the area.</description>

      <title>Conformal dynamics at infinity for groups with contracting elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04861v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of conformal density at infinity for groups with contracting elements. We start by introducing a class of convergence boundary encompassing many known hyperbolic-like boundaries, on which a detailed study of conical points and Myrberg points is carried out. The basic theory of conformal density is then established on the convergence boundary, including the Sullivan shadow lemma and a Hopf--Tsuji--Sullivan dichotomy. This gives a unification of the theory of conformal density on the Gromov and Floyd boundary for (relatively) hyperbolic groups, the visual boundary for rank-1 CAT(0) groups, and Thurston boundary for mapping class groups. Besides that, the conformal density on the horofunction boundary provides a new important example of our general theory. Applications include the identification of Poisson boundary of random walks, the co-growth problem of divergent groups, measure theoretical results for CAT(0) groups and mapping class groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ be a field of characteristic $p &gt; 0$. In prior work, we studied endotrivial complexes, the invertible objects of the bounded homotopy category $K^b({}_{kG}\mathbf{triv})$ of $p$-permutation $kG$-modules. Using the notion of projectivity relative to a $kG$-module, we expand on this study by defining notions of "relatively" endotrivial chain complexes, analogous to Lassueur's construction of relatively endotrivial $kG$-modules. We obtain equivalent characterizations of relative endotriviality and find corresponding local homological data which almost completely determine the isomorphism class of a relatively endotrivial complex. We show this local data must partially satisfy the Borel-Smith conditions, and consider the behavior of restriction to subgroups containing Sylow $p$-subgroups $S$ of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on a finite set with solvable point stabiliser and assume that the solvable radical of $G$ is trivial. In 2010, Vdovin conjectured that the base size of $G$ is at most 5. Burness proved this conjecture in the case of primitive $G$. The problem was reduced by Vdovin in 2012 to the case when $G$ is an almost simple group. Now the problem is further reduced to groups of Lie type through work of Baykalov and Burness. In this paper, we prove the strong form of the conjecture for all almost simple groups with socle isomorphic to $\PSL_n(q),$ and the remaining classical groups will be handled in two forthcoming papers.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the normalising graph of a group and study the connectivity of the normalising and permuting graphs of a group when the group is finite and soluble. In particular, we classify finite soluble groups with disconnected normalising graph. The main results shows that if a finite soluble group has connected normalising graph then this graph has diameter at most 6. Furthermore, this bound is tight. A corollary then presents the connectivity properties of the permuting graph.</description>

Abstract: We give a relatively self-contained proof that if a group $G$ fibres algebraically and is part of a $\mathrm{PD}^3$-pair, then $G$ is the fundamental group of a fibred compact aspherical 3-manifold. This yields a homological proof of a classical theorem of Stallings: if $G = \pi_1(M^3)$ is the fundamental group of a compact irreducible 3-manifold $M^3$ and $\phi \colon G \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a surjective homomorphism with finitely generated kernel, then $\phi$ is induced by a topological fibration of $M^3$ over the circle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the Wells derivation for extensions realizing affine datum in arbitrary varieties; in particular, we show there is an exact sequence connecting the group of compatible automorphisms determined by the datum and the subgroup of automorphisms of an extension which preserves the extension's kernel. This implies a homomorphism between $2^{\mathrm{nd}}$-cohomology groups which realizes a group of kernel-preserving automorphisms of an extension as itself an extension of a subgroup of compatible automorphisms by the group of derivations of the datum. A refinement of this general Wells's-type theorem is given for a restricted class of varieties with a difference term which include any variety of groups with multiple operators in the sense of Higgins. The same results are obtained for nonabelian extensions in any variety of $R$-modules expanded by multilinear operations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the natural permutation representation of highly transitive finite groups cannot be realized as the full automorphism group of an idempotent, finite-dimensional evolution algebra acting on the set of lines spanned by its natural elements. Specifically, for any sufficiently large integer $n$ and $k \geq 4$, there does not exist an idempotent evolution algebra $X$ of dimension $n$ such that $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ is isomorphic to a proper $k$-transitive subgroup of $S_n$.
  Nevertheless, we show that for any finite group $G$, any permutation representation $\xi \colon G \to S_n$, and any field $\Bbbk$, there exists an idempotent, finite-dimensional evolution $\Bbbk$-algebra $X$ such that $\operatorname{Aut}(X) \cong G$, and the induced representation of $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ on the natural idempotents of $X$ is equivalent to $\xi$.</description>

      <title>On identities in connected topological groups</title>

Abstract: In 1957, Nemytskii proved the following fact: if in a locally compact or in an Abelian connected group there is a neighborhood of the identity in which some identity holds, then it holds in the entire group. The following question was also posed there: Let G be a connected topological group. In some neighborhood of the identity of the group G the identity $x^3=1$ holds. Is it true that then the identity $x^3=1$ holds in the entire group $G$? The same question is posed for the identity $gx^2 = x^2g$, where $g$ is a fixed element of the group. Platonov formulated the following generalized formulation of the Mytselsky problem: for a topological connected group, is it true that if the identity holds in a neighborhood of the identity, then the identity holds everywhere? In this paper, a negative answer to Platonov's question is given, the following theorem is proven: if $n &gt; 10^{10}$ is odd, then there exists a connected topological group in which the identity $x^n=1$ holds in some neighborhood of unity, but not in the entire group.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Lie groups that can be realized as automorphism groups of bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem whether a given Lie group can be realized as the group of all biholomorphic automorphisms of a bounded domain in ${\mathbb C}^n$. In an earlier paper of 1990, we proved the result for connected linear Lie groups. In this paper we give examples of non-linear groups for which the result still holds.</description>
