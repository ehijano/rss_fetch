      <title>Intervalley-Coupled Twisted Bilayer Graphene from Substrate Commensuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that intervalley coupling can be induced in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) by aligning the bottom graphene layer with either of two types of commensurate insulating triangular Bravais lattice substrate. The intervalley coupling folds the $\pm K$ valleys of TBG to $\Gamma$-point and hybridizes the original TBG flat bands into a four-band model equivalent to the $p_x$-$p_y$ orbital honeycomb lattice model, in which the second conduction and valence bands have quadratic band touchings and can become flat due to geometric frustration. The spin-orbit coupling from the substrate opens gaps between the bands, yielding topological bands with spin Chern numbers $\mathcal{C}$ up to $\pm 4$. For realistic substrate potential strengths, the minimal bandwidths of the hybridized flat bands are still achieved around the TBG magic angle $\theta_M=1.05^\circ$, and their quantum metrics are nearly ideal. We identify two candidate substrate materials Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and GeSb$_2$Te$_4$, which nearly perfectly realize the commensurate lattice constant ratio of $\sqrt{3}$ with graphene. These systems provide a promising platform for exploring strongly correlated topological states driven by geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fragile Topology Enabled by Matrix Homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moire flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene have attracted considerable attention not only because of the emergence of correlated phases but also due to their nontrivial topology. Specifically, they exhibit a new class of topology that can be nullified by the addition of trivial bands, termed fragile topology, which suggests the need for an expansion of existing classification schemes. Here, we develop a Z2 energy-resolved topological marker for classifying fragile phases using a system's position-space description, enabling the direct classification of finite, disordered, and aperiodic materials. By translating the physical symmetries protecting the system's fragile topological phase into matrix symmetries of the system's Hamiltonian and position operators, we use matrix homotopy to construct our topological marker while simultaneously yielding a quantitative measure of topological robustness. We show our framework's effectiveness using a C2T-symmetric twisted bilayer graphene model and photonic crystal as a continuum example. We have found that fragile topology can persist both under strong disorder and in heterostructures lacking a bulk spectral gap, and even an example of disorder-induced re-entrant topology. Overall, the proposed scheme serves as an effective tool for elucidating aspects of fragile topology, offering guidance for potential applications across a variety of experimental platforms from topological photonics to correlated phases in materials.</description>

      <title>Principal component analysis for 5/2 fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the special single-layer fractional quantum Hall system with a filling factor of 5/2, which has an even denominator, this paper uses principal component analysis (PCA) to study its behavior under the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. By introducing a model three-body potential to represent the mechanism of particle-hole symmetry breaking, the paper finds that the 5/2 system evolves into two types of special topological quantum states with non-Abelian statistics as the strength and direction of the three-body potential vary. The transition points of these states correspond to the particle-hole symmetric pure Coulomb interaction system. Our results validate the applicability of machine learning as a new research tool in fractional quantum Hall systems. Furthermore, machine learning directly analyzes the raw wave functions, without relying on prior empirical theoretical assumptions and models, making it applicable to a broader range of fractional quantum Hall systems experiencing phase transitions due to particle-hole symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Spectral signature of periodic modulation and sliding of pseudogap state in moire system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the pseudogap state is widely believed as a key to understanding the pairing mechanism underlying unconventional superconductivity. Over the past two decades, significant efforts have been devoted to searching for spontaneous symmetry breaking or potential order parameters associated with these pseudogap states, aiming to better characterize their properties. Recently, pseudogap states have also been realized in moire systems with extensive gate tunability, yet their local electronic structure remains largely unexplored8. In this study, we report the observation of gate-tunable spontaneous symmetry breaking and sliding behavior of the pseudogap state in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MAtBG) using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy. Our spectroscopy reveals a distinct pseudogap at 4.4 K within the doping range -3 &lt; v &lt; -2. Spectroscopic imaging highlights a gap size modulation at moire scale that is sensitive to the filling, indicative of a wave-like fluctuating pseudogap feature. Specifically, the positions of gap size minima (GSM) coincide with regions of the highest local density of states (LDOS) at the filling v = -2.63, but a unidirectional sliding behavior of GSM is observed for other fillings. In addition, the pseudogap size distribution at certain doping levels also causes a clear nematic order, or an anisotropic gap distribution. Our results have shed light on the complex nature of this pseudogap state, revealing critical insights into the phase diagram of correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation of NV centers in nanodiamonds adsorbed on conducting and non-conducting surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds can be utilized as low-cost, highly versatile quantum sensors for studying surface properties in condensed matter physics through the application of relaxometry protocols. For such applications, a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic relaxation processes of NV centers in nanodiamonds is necessary. Here, we study the spin-lattice relaxation rates of NV ensembles in nanodiamonds with average diameters of 40 nm and 3 $\mu$m between room temperature and $\sim$ 6 K. The NV relaxation curves fit to a stretched-exponential form with a stretching exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, implying the large distribution of relaxation times of individual centers within nanodiamonds. We determine the Orbach-like scattering on phonons as the leading relaxation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the viability of nanodiamonds as surface sensors when deposited on a metallic substrate and emphasize the need for well-controlled surface preparation techniques.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric fluctuations of interfering Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium states produced by electric and thermal voltages ($V$, $V_T$) provide a straightforward insight into underlying degrees of freedom of composite nanostructures and are of particular interest to probe Majorana bound states. Here we explore fluctuations of thermoelectric currents at finite frequencies $\omega$ in a quantum dot coupled to two interfering Majorana bound states. At small $V$ we find that in the emission spectra the differential thermoelectric quantum noise $\partial S^&gt;/\partial V_T$ shows an antiresonance whereas in the absorption spectra Majorana interference induces an antiresonance-resonance pair. At large $V$ this pair is preserved whereas the emission antiresonance turns into an antiresonance-resonance pair identical to the absorption one making $\partial S^&gt;/\partial V_T$ antisymmetric in the frequency $\omega$. This antisymmetry distinguishes Majorana behavior from the one induced by Andreev bound states and does not break at higher temperatures making it attractive for experiments on Majorana interference via thermoelectric fluctuation response.</description>

      <title>Co-existing magnetization reversal mechanisms in shakti spin ice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The switching mechanisms in artificial spin ice systems are investigated with focus on shakti and modified shakti lattices. Minimum energy paths are calculated using the geodesic nudged elastic band (GNEB) method implemented with a micromagnetic description of the system, including the internal magnetic structure of the islands and edge modulations. Two switching mechanisms, uniform magnetization rotation and domain wall formation, are found to have comparable activation energy. The preference for one over the other depends strongly on the saturation magnetization and the magnetic ordering of neighboring islands. Surprisingly, these mechanisms can coexist, leading to an enhanced probability of magnetization reversal. These results provide valuable insight that can help control internal magnetization switching processes in spin ice systems and help predict their thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Minimizing sensor-sample distances in scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has led to significant advances in the sensitive imaging of magnetic systems. The spatial resolution of the technique, however, remains limited to tens to hundreds of nanometers, even for probes where NV centers are engineered within 10 nm from the tip apex. Here, we present a correlated investigation of the crucial parameters that determine the spatial resolution: the mechanical and magnetic stand-off distances, as well as the sub-surface NV center depth in diamond. We study their contributions using mechanical approach curves, photoluminescence measurements, magnetometry scans, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of surface adsorbates. We first show that the stand-off distance is mainly limited by features on the surface of the diamond tip, hindering mechanical access. Next, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) feedback partially overcomes this issue, leading to closer and more consistent magnetic stand-off distances (26-87 nm) compared to the more common amplitude-modulated (AM-AFM) feedback (43-128 nm). FM operation thus permits improved magnetic imaging of sub-100-nm spin textures, shown for the spin cycloid in BFO and domain walls in a CoFeB synthetic antiferromagnet. Finally, by examining 1H and 19F NMR signals in soft contact with a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, we demonstrate a minimum NV-to-sample distance of 7.9+/-0.4 nm.</description>

      <title>Casimir-like effect driven self-assembly of graphene on molten metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Casimir effect, explained by Hendrik Casimir in 1948, is a macroscopic manifestation of quantum electrodynamics. Symmetry breaking due to space confinement of vacuum fluctuations in between two planar mirrors results in an attractive force acting between the two mirrors. Here, we show that spontaneous self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials grown on molten metals (rheotaxy) is driven by the mechanical forces exerted by the liquid on the graphene domain and that these forces are subject to a Casimir-like effect. We present in situ environmental and ultrahigh vacuum scanning electron microscopy observations of chemical vapor deposition of graphene on both solid and molten gold and copper, which reveal that the self-assembly occurs via translational and rotational motions of graphene domains during growth on molten metals. Using high-temperature (~ 1300 K) atomic force microscopy measurements of graphene/molten-metal interfaces, coupled with density functional theory and continuum modelling of 2D layers floating on a liquid surface, we attribute the observed phenomena to Casimir-like effect of surface undulations and give further guidance for achieving seamless stitching of 2D layer domains into large scale monolayers.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener tunneling among Floquet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic fields not only induce electronic transitions but also fundamentally modify the quantum states of matter through strong light-matter interactions. As one established route, Floquet engineering provides a powerful framework to dress electronic states with time-periodic fields, giving rise to quasi-stationary Floquet states. With increasing field strength, non-perturbative responses of the dressed states emerge, yet their nonlinear dynamics remain challenging to interpret. In this work we explore the emergence of non-adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions among Floquet states in Cu(111) under intense optical fields. At increasing field strength, we observe a transition from perturbative dressing to a regime where Floquet states undergo non-adiabatic tunneling, revealing a breakdown of adiabatic Floquet evolution. These insights are obtained through interferometrically time-resolved multi-photon photoemission spectroscopy, which serves as a sensitive probe of transient Floquet state dynamics. Numerical simulations and the theory of instantaneous Floquet states allow us to directly examine real-time excitation pathways in this non-perturbative photoemission regime. Our results establish a direct connection the onset of light-dressing of matter, non-perturbative ultrafast lightwave electronics, and high-optical-harmonic generation in the solids.</description>

      <title>Obstacle-Induced Gurzhi Effect and Hydrodynamic Electron Flow in Two-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscous flow of electrons in a narrow channel requires both strong electron-electron interactions and no-slip boundary conditions. However, introducing obstacles within the liquid can significantly increase flow resistance and, as a result, amplify the effects of viscosity. Even in samples with smooth walls, the presence of an obstacle can strongly alter electron behavior, leading to pronounced hydrodynamic effects. We investigated transport in mesoscopic samples containing a disordered array of obstacles. In contrast to samples without obstacles, which do not show a decrease in resistivity with rising temperature, samples with obstacles exhibit a significant resistivity reduction as temperature increases (the Gurzhi effect). By measuring the negative magnetoresistance, we extracted shear viscosity and other parameters through comparison with theoretical predictions. Consequently, narrow-channel samples with a disordered obstacle array provide a valuable platform for studying hydrodynamic electron flow independently of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Currernt Flow Mapping in Conducting Ferroelectric Domain Walls using Scanning NV-Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of parallel plate capacitors, with ferroelectric lithium niobate as the dielectric layer, can be extensively and progressively modified by the controlled injection of conducting domain walls. Domain wall-based memristor devices hence result. Microstructures, developed as a result of partial switching, are complex and so simple models of equivalent circuits, based on the collective action of all conducting domain wall channels acting identically and in parallel, may not be appropriate. Here, we directly map the current density in ferroelectric domain wall memristors in-situ, by mapping Oersted fields, using nitrogen vacancy centre microscopy. Current density maps were found to directly correlate with the domain microstructure, revealing that a strikingly small fraction of the total domain wall network is responsible for the majority of the current flow. This insight forces a two order of magnitude correction to the carrier densities, previously inferred from standard scanning probe or macroscopic electrical characterisation.</description>

      <title>Surface-dominant transport in Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires for next-generation interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing demands for smaller and more energy efficient electronic devices necessitate alternative interconnect materials with lower electrical resistivity at reduced dimensions. Despite the emergence of many promising candidates, synthesizing high quality nanostructures remains a major bottleneck in evaluating their performance. Here, we report the successful synthesis of Weyl semimetal NbAs nanowires via thermomechanical nanomolding, achieving single crystallinity and controlled diameters as small as 40 nm. Our NbAs nanowires exhibit a remarkably low room-temperature resistivity of 9.7 +/- 1.6 microOhm-cm, which is three to four times lower than their bulk counterpart. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations, attributing this exceptional resistivity reduction to surface dominant conduction with long carrier lifetime at finite temperatures. Further characterization of NbAs nanowires and bulk single crystals reveals high breakdown current density, robust stability, and superior thermal conductivity. Collectively, these properties highlight the strong potential of NbAs nanowires as next-generation interconnects, which can surpass the limitations of current copper-based interconnects. Technologically, our findings present a practical application of topological materials, while scientifically showcasing the fundamental properties uniquely accessible in nanoscale platforms.</description>

      <title>Characterizing $S=3/2$ AKLT Hamiltonian with Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AKLT Hamiltonian is a particular instance of a general class of model Hamiltonians defined in lattices with coordination $z$ where each site hosts a spins $S=z/2$, interacting both with linear and non-linear exchange couplings. In two dimensions, the AKLT model features a gap in the spectrum, and its ground state is a valence bond solid state; that is an universal resource for measurement based quantum computing, motivating the quest of physical systems that realize this Hamiltonian. Given a finite-size system described with a specific instance of this general class of models, we address the question of how to asses if such system is a realization of the AKLT model using inelastic tunnel spectroscopy implemented with scanning tunnel microscopy (IETS-STM). We propose two approaches. First, in the case of a dimer, we show how to leverage non-equilibrium IETS-STM to obtain the energies of all excited states, and determine thereby the magnitude of both linear and non-linear exchange interactions. Second, we explore how IETS can probe the in-gap excitations associated to edge spins. In the AKLT limit, spins $S=3/2$ at the edge of the lattice have coordination 2, giving rise to $S=1/2$ dangling spins that can be probed with IETS. We propose a $S=1/2$ effective Hamiltonian to describe the interactions between these dangling spins in the neighborhood of the AKLT point, where their degeneracy lifted.</description>

      <title>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behavior confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after foam yielding. Following the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling stress and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructural features of close-cell foams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a robust formulation to calculate the Casimir energy and Casimir force for plane-parallel multilayer setups with general dielectric constants. We derive recursion relations for multilayer reflection and transmission coefficients in the most general setups, which are essential ingredients for evaluating the Casimir energy. With the use of complex analysis techniques involving the argument principle, we carefully treat and subtract UV divergences and make clear the relation between the subtraction procedure and an actual physical setup. We also clarify the physical operational meaning of pole subtraction, which is required to utilize the argument principle in the calculation of the Casimir energy. Our formula is applicable to more general situations including chiral medium or Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Investigations of Metal-Organic structures for applications in Organic Spin Valve devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic spintronics has drawn the interest of the science community due to various applications in spin-valve devices. But to date, an efficient room-temperature Organic Spin Valve device has not been experimentally realized due to the complicated spin transport at the metal-organic interfaces. These studies are always challenging due to the complicated spin-polarized charge transfer at the metal-organic interfaces. The present study focuses on a comprehensive understanding of the interfacial properties that are essential for advancing device performance and functionality. The Ferromagnetic metals and half-metallic electrodes such as Co, Co2FeAl, etc., and fullerene (C60) bilayer samples are prepared and studied via different structural and magnetic characterizations. Due to the mechanical softness of C60, deep penetration of ferromagnetic metal atoms is observed inside the C60 film. In-situ MOKE measurements reveal the origin of the 23 {\AA} thick magnetic dead layer at the interface, which is attributed to the diffused ferromagnetic clusters exhibiting superparamagnetic behavior. In contrast to the inorganic substrates, magnetic anisotropy tends to develop at 40 {\AA} thick Co film deposited on C60 which enhances with increasing thickness. The XRD measurements confirm the presence of in-plane compressive strain and texturing along the hcp (002) phase in the Co film. The anomaly observed in the hard axis of magnetization is due to high dispersion in the local magnetic anisotropy. The variation of the magnetic anisotropy axis is observed in the Co2FeAlwedge deposited in the proximity of C60. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between ferromagnetic materials and organic semiconductors offering potential avenues for tailoring magnetoresistance effects and fundamental understanding of organic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Identifying high-energy electronic states of NV$^-$ centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond is a prototype photoluminescent point defect spin qubit with promising quantum technology applications, enabled by its efficient optical spin polarization and readout. Its low-lying electronic states and optical spin polarization cycle have been well characterized over decades, establishing it as a benchmark system for state-of-the-art computational methods in point defect research. While the optical cycle is well understood, a comprehensive energetic analysis of higher-lying states has received less attention until recently. In this joint experimental theoretical study, we identify and characterize five high-energy states beyond those involved in the optical cycle. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determine their transition energies and relative oscillator strengths. Additionally, we perform two independent numerical studies employing two state-of-the-art post-DFT methods to support the experimental findings and assign energy levels. These results enhance our understanding of the NV center's energy spectrum and providing a broader reference for benchmarking high-level first-principles methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced magneto-optical effects in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical effects (MOEs), as a fundamental physical phenomenon, can reveal the electronic structures of materials. The related probing methods are widely used in the study of magnetic materials. However, space-time inversion ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric antiferromagnets were previously believed to be magneto-optically inactive. Here, we point out that this traditional understanding is incorrect. Based on our generic formulas and symmetry analysis, we find that in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets, it is the quantum metric, i.e., the real part of the quantum geometry, that induces MOEs. Combining a tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we confirm this observation by showing MOEs in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets previously thought to lack MOEs can indeed exhibit MOEs and greatly broaden the research on MOEs.</description>

      <title>Twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal based on stacking and selective etching of 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonic devices with moir\'e superlattice is currently attracting broad interest due to the unique periodicity and high efficiency control of photons. Till now, experimental investigations mainly focus on the single layer device, i.e., two or more layers of photonic crystal patterns are merged and etched in a single layer of material. By comparison, twisted photonic crystal with multilayer materials raises challenges in the nanofabrication technology, because the growth of upper layer material usually requires a smooth bottom layer without nanostructures. Hereby, we fabricate twisted heterobilayer photonic crystal in the graphite/Si$_3$N$_4$ heterostructure. We use dry transfer method to stack the graphite on top of bottom Si$_3$N$_4$ with pre-etched photonic crystal patterns. Selective dry etching recipes are used to etch two photonic crystal layers individually, which improves the quality and accuracy in alignment. The cavity photonic mode at the visible wavelength $\sim 700$ nm arsing from the moir\'e site is clearly observed in experiment. These results reveal the experimental diagram of heterobilayer nanophotonic devices and open the way to design flexibility and control of photons in new degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.</description>

      <title>Symmetry requirements for current-induced spin magnetization specific to chiral crystals: Multipole analysis and the hidden spin glide symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current-induced spin magnetization (CISM) specific to chiral crystals is microscopically analyzed using multipole theory to identify the necessary hopping and spin-orbit couplings (SOCs). Tight-binding models capturing the essence of chiral crystals are introduced to investigate the multipole degrees of freedom possessed by the Hamiltonian. The results reveal that chiral SOC has a multipole degree of freedom specific to chiral crystals. Subsequently, the CISM is evaluated numerically and analytically. The results show that in addition to the chiral SOC, hopping along the $z$-axis, which is irrelevant from a multipole perspective, is crucial for CISM. This hopping is required to break the combined symmetry of wavevector translation and spin flipping, which we refer to as spin glide symmetry. This confirms that hopping irrelevant to chirality can play a crucial role in physical properties arising from chirality without contradicting the framework of multipole theory.</description>

Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory unifying the topological responses and anomalies of various gapless fermion systems exhibiting Fermi surfaces, including those with Berry phases, and nodal structures, which applies beyond non-interacting limit. As our key finding, we obtain a general approach to directly relate gapless fermions and topological insulators in phase space, including first- and higher-order insulators. Using this relation we show that the low-energy properties and response theories for gapless fermionic systems can be directly obtained without resorting to microscopic details. Our results provide a unified framework for describing such systems using well-developed theories from the study of topological phases of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective effects, such as Dicke superradiant emission, can enhance the performance of a quantum device. Here, we study the heat current flowing between a cold and a hot bath through an ensemble of $N$ qubits, which are collectively coupled to the thermal baths. We find a regime where the collective coupling leads to a quadratic scaling of the heat current with $N$ in a finite-size scenario. Conversely, when approaching the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the collective scenario exhibits a parametric enhancement over the non-collective case. We then consider the presence of a third uncontrolled {\it parasitic} bath, interacting locally with each qubit, that models unavoidable couplings to the external environment. Despite having a non-perturbative effect on the steady-state currents, we show that the collective enhancement is robust to such an addition. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of realizing such a Dicke heat valve with superconducting circuits. Our findings indicate that in a minimal realistic experimental setting with two superconducting qubits, the collective advantage offers an enhancement of approximately $10\%$ compared to the non-collective scenario.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a theoretical and computational investigations of the atomic scale structure of the heterointerface formed between the (001) surface of $L1_0$-ordered iron palladium (FePd) alloy and graphene (Gr), namely, $L1_0$-FePd(001)/Gr. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the topmost surface layer consisting of Pd (Pd-terminated surface) becomes more energetically stable than Fe, and Pd-terminated surfaces are not conducive to Gr adsorption. On the other hand, under oxygen atmosphere conditions, our calculation suggests the presence of Fe-terminated surfaces with Gr-covered structures reproducing recent experimental observations. Moreover, the finding of Fe--O bonds formed by oxidizated surface is also consistent with those of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings are crucial for understanding the fabrication processes of interfaces in Fe-based $L1_0$ alloy materials.</description>

      <title>Tunable Thermal Conductivity and Mechanical Properties of Metastable Silicon by Phase Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extensive applications of cubic silicon in flexible transistors and infrared detectors are much hindered by its intrinsic properties. Metastable silicon phases, such as Si-III, IV and XII prepared using extreme pressure method, provide a unique "genetic bank" with diverse structures and exotic characteristics, however, exploration on their inherent physical properties remains immature. Herein, we demonstrate the phase engineering strategy to modulate the thermal conductivity and mechanical properties of metastable silicon. The thermal conductivity obtained via Raman optothermal approach presents the broad tunability across various Si-I, III, XII and IV phases. The hardness and Young's modulus of Si-IV are remarkably greater than those of Si-III/XII mixture, confirmed by nanoindentation technique. Moreover, it was found that the pressure-induced structural defects can substantially degrade the thermal and mechanical properties of silicon. This systematic investigation can offer feasible route to design novel semiconductors and further advance their desirable applications in advanced nanodevices and mechanical transducers.</description>
