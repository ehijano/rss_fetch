      <title>Efficient State Estimation of a Networked FlipIt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boolean Kalman Filter and associated Boolean Dynamical System Theory have been proposed to study the spread of infection on computer networks. Such models feature a network where attacks propagate through, an intrusion detection system that provides noisy signals of the true state of the network, and the capability of the defender to clean a subset of computers at any time. The Boolean Kalman Filter has been used to solve the optimal estimation problem, by estimating the hidden true state given the attack-defense dynamics and noisy observations. However, this algorithm is infeasible because it runs in exponential time and space with respect to the network size. We address this feasibility problem by proposing a mean-field estimation approach, which is inspired by the epidemic modeling literature. Although our approach is heuristic, we prove that our estimator exactly matches the optimal estimator in certain non-trivial cases. We conclude by using simulations to show both the run-time improvement and estimation accuracy of our approach.</description>

      <title>MaLAware: Automating the Comprehension of Malicious Software Behaviours using Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current malware (malicious software) analysis tools focus on detection and family classification but fail to provide clear and actionable narrative insights into the malignant activity of the malware. Therefore, there is a need for a tool that translates raw malware data into human-readable descriptions. Developing such a tool accelerates incident response, reduces malware analysts' cognitive load, and enables individuals having limited technical expertise to understand malicious software behaviour. With this objective, we present MaLAware, which automatically summarizes the full spectrum of malicious activity of malware executables. MaLAware processes Cuckoo Sandbox-generated reports using large language models (LLMs) to correlate malignant activities and generate concise summaries explaining malware behaviour. We evaluate the tool's performance on five open-source LLMs. The evaluation uses the human-written malware behaviour description dataset as ground truth. The model's performance is measured using 11 extensive performance metrics, which boosts the confidence of MaLAware's effectiveness. The current version of the tool, i.e., MaLAware, supports Qwen2.5-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Falcon-7B, along with the quantization feature for resource-constrained environments. MaLAware lays a foundation for future research in malware behavior explanation, and its extensive evaluation demonstrates LLMs' ability to narrate malware behavior in an actionable and comprehensive manner.</description>

      <title>Coinductive Proofs of Regular Expression Equivalence in Zero Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge (ZK) protocols enable software developers to provide proofs of their programs' correctness to other parties without revealing the programs themselves. Regular expressions are pervasive in real-world software, and zero-knowledge protocols have been developed in the past for the problem of checking whether an individual string appears in the language of a regular expression, but no existing protocol addresses the more complex PSPACE-complete problem of proving that two regular expressions are equivalent.
  We introduce Crepe, the first ZK protocol for encoding regular expression equivalence proofs and also the first ZK protocol to target a PSPACE-complete problem. Crepe uses a custom calculus of proof rules based on regular expression derivatives and coinduction, and we introduce a sound and complete algorithm for generating proofs in our format. We test Crepe on a suite of hundreds of regular expression equivalence proofs. Crepe can validate large proofs in only a few seconds each.</description>

      <title>Highway to Hull: An Algorithm for Solving the General Matrix Code Equivalence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix code equivalence problem consists, given two matrix spaces $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}\subset \mathbb{F}_q^{m\times n}$ of dimension $k$, in finding invertible matrices $P\in\mathrm{GL}_m(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $Q\in\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $\mathcal{D}=P\mathcal{C} Q^{-1}$. Recent signature schemes such as MEDS and ALTEQ relate their security to the hardness of this problem. Naranayan et. al. recently published an algorithm solving this problem in the case $k = n =m$ in $\widetilde{O}(q^{\frac k 2})$ operations. We present a different algorithm which solves the problem in the general case. Our approach consists in reducing the problem to the matrix code conjugacy problem, i.e. the case $P=Q$. For the latter problem, similarly to the permutation code equivalence problem in Hamming metric, a natural invariant based on the Hull of the code can be used. Next, the equivalence of codes can be deduced using a usual list collision argument. For $k=m=n$, our algorithm achieves the same complexity as in the aforementioned reference. However, it extends to a much broader range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Towards Resilient Federated Learning in CyberEdge Networks: Recent Advances and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we investigate the most recent techniques of resilient federated learning (ResFL) in CyberEdge networks, focusing on joint training with agglomerative deduction and feature-oriented security mechanisms. We explore adaptive hierarchical learning strategies to tackle non-IID data challenges, improving scalability and reducing communication overhead. Fault tolerance techniques and agglomerative deduction mechanisms are studied to detect unreliable devices, refine model updates, and enhance convergence stability. Unlike existing FL security research, we comprehensively analyze feature-oriented threats, such as poisoning, inference, and reconstruction attacks that exploit model features. Moreover, we examine resilient aggregation techniques, anomaly detection, and cryptographic defenses, including differential privacy and secure multi-party computation, to strengthen FL security. In addition, we discuss the integration of 6G, large language models (LLMs), and interoperable learning frameworks to enhance privacy-preserving and decentralized cross-domain training. These advancements offer ultra-low latency, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven network management, and improved resilience against adversarial attacks, fostering the deployment of secure ResFL in CyberEdge networks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Framework To Assess Cybersecurity Capability Maturity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organisations face escalating cyber threats that can disrupt operations, compromise sensitive data, and inflict financial and reputational harm. A key reason for this lies in the organisations' lack of a clear understanding of their cybersecurity capabilities, leading to ineffective defences. To address this gap, Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Models (CCMMs) provide a systematic approach to assessing and enhancing an organisation's cybersecurity posture by focusing on capability maturity rather than merely implementing controls. However, their limitations, such as rigid structures, one-size-fits-all approach, complexity, gaps in security scope (i.e., technological, organisational, and human aspects) and lack of quantitative metrics, hinder their effectiveness. It makes implementing CCMMs in varying contexts challenging and results in fragmented, incomprehensive assessments. Therefore, we propose a novel Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Framework that is holistic, flexible, and measurable to provide organisations with a more relevant and impactful assessment to enhance their cybersecurity posture.</description>

      <title>FireGuard: A Generalized Microarchitecture for Fine-Grained Security Analysis on OoO Superscalar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance security guarantees rely on hardware support. Generic programmable support for fine-grained instruction analysis has gained broad interest in the literature as a fundamental building block for the security of future processors. Yet, implementation in real out-of-order (OoO) superscalar processors presents tough challenges that cannot be explored in highly abstract simulators. We detail the challenges of implementing complex programmable pathways without critical paths or contention. We then introduce FireGuard, the first implementation of fine-grained instruction analysis on a real OoO superscalar processor. We establish an end-to-end system, including microarchitecture, SoC, ISA and programming model. Experiments show that our solution simultaneously ensures both security and performance of the system, with parallel scalability. We examine the feasibility of building FireGuard into modern SoCs: Apple's M1-Pro, Huawei's Kirin-960, and Intel's i7-12700F, where less than 1% silicon area is introduced. The Repo. of FireGuard's source code: https://github.com/SEU-ACAL/reproduce-FireGuard-DAC-25.</description>

      <title>From Easy to Hard: Building a Shortcut for Differentially Private Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) image synthesis aims to generate synthetic images from a sensitive dataset, alleviating the privacy leakage concerns of organizations sharing and utilizing synthetic images. Although previous methods have significantly progressed, especially in training diffusion models on sensitive images with DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), they still suffer from unsatisfactory performance. In this work, inspired by curriculum learning, we propose a two-stage DP image synthesis framework, where diffusion models learn to generate DP synthetic images from easy to hard. Unlike existing methods that directly use DP-SGD to train diffusion models, we propose an easy stage in the beginning, where diffusion models learn simple features of the sensitive images. To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central images', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset. Intuitively, although those central images do not show details, they demonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy costs, thus helping early-phase model training. We conduct experiments to present that on the average of four investigated image datasets, the fidelity and utility metrics of our synthetic images are 33.1% and 2.1% better than the state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>PiCo: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via $\textbf{Pi}$ctorial $\textbf{Co}$de Contextualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate vision and other modalities into Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhance AI capabilities but also introduce new security vulnerabilities. By exploiting the vulnerabilities of the visual modality and the long-tail distribution characteristic of code training data, we present PiCo, a novel jailbreaking framework designed to progressively bypass multi-tiered defense mechanisms in advanced MLLMs. PiCo employs a tier-by-tier jailbreak strategy, using token-level typographic attacks to evade input filtering and embedding harmful intent within programming context instructions to bypass runtime monitoring. To comprehensively assess the impact of attacks, a new evaluation metric is further proposed to assess both the toxicity and helpfulness of model outputs post-attack. By embedding harmful intent within code-style visual instructions, PiCo achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.13% on Gemini-Pro Vision and 52.66% on GPT-4, surpassing previous methods. Experimental results highlight the critical gaps in current defenses, underscoring the need for more robust strategies to secure advanced MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Identifying Obfuscated Code through Graph-Based Semantic Analysis of Binary Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting sensitive program content is a critical issue in various situations, ranging from legitimate use cases to unethical contexts. Obfuscation is one of the most used techniques to ensure such protection. Consequently, attackers must first detect and characterize obfuscation before launching any attack against it. This paper investigates the problem of function-level obfuscation detection using graph-based approaches, comparing algorithms, from elementary baselines to promising techniques like GNN (Graph Neural Networks), on different feature choices. We consider various obfuscation types and obfuscators, resulting in two complex datasets. Our findings demonstrate that GNNs need meaningful features that capture aspects of function semantics to outperform baselines. Our approach shows satisfactory results, especially in a challenging 11-class classification task and in a practical malware analysis example.</description>

      <title>LightDefense: A Lightweight Uncertainty-Driven Defense against Jailbreaks via Shifted Token Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for defending against jailbreak attacks are primarily based on auxiliary models. These strategies, however, often require extensive data collection or training. We propose LightDefense, a lightweight defense mechanism targeted at white-box models, which utilizes a safety-oriented direction to adjust the probabilities of tokens in the vocabulary, making safety disclaimers appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. We further innovatively leverage LLM's uncertainty about prompts to measure their harmfulness and adaptively adjust defense strength, effectively balancing safety and helpfulness. The effectiveness of LightDefense in defending against 5 attack methods across 2 target LLMs, without compromising helpfulness to benign user queries, highlights its potential as a novel and lightweight defense mechanism, enhancing security of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Vers une mod\'elisation de la confiance dans le renseignement sur les menaces cyber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is essential for effective system defense. CTI is a collection of information about current or past threats to a computer system. This information is gathered by an agent through observation, or based on a set of sources. Building intelligence only makes sense if you have confidence in it. To achieve this, it is necessary to estimate the confidence in each piece of information gathered, taking into account the different dimensions that can make it up: reliability of the source, competence, plausibility of the information, credibility of the information, for example. The information gathered must then be combined with other information to consolidate an agent's knowledge. Recent advances have been made in the theory underlying the modeling of trust for decision-making based on uncertain information, notably by using multivalued logic. This approach makes it possible to deal with unknown values of trust-building parameters, or to easily integrate dimensions. In this article we present the problem of CTI and CTI information sharing, and the reasons that led us to use a logic-based solution for an initial implementation.</description>

      <title>DISINFOX: an open-source threat exchange platform serving intelligence on disinformation and influence operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces DISINFOX, an open-source threat intelligence exchange platform for the structured collection, management, and dissemination of disinformation incidents and influence operations. Analysts can upload and correlate information manipulation and interference incidents, while clients can access and analyze the data through an interactive web interface or programmatically via a public API. This facilitates integration with other vendors, providing a unified view of cybersecurity and disinformation events.
  The solution is fully containerized using Docker, comprising a web-based frontend for user interaction, a backend REST API for managing core functionalities, and a public API for structured data retrieval, enabling seamless integration with existing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) workflows. In particular, DISINFOX models the incidents through DISARM Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), a MITRE ATT&amp;CK-like framework for disinformation, with a custom data model based on the Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX2) standard.
  As an open-source solution, DISINFOX provides a reproducible and extensible hub for researchers, analysts, and policymakers seeking to enhance the detection, investigation, and mitigation of disinformation threats. The intelligence generated from a custom dataset has been tested and utilized by a local instance of OpenCTI, a mature CTI platform, via a custom-built connector, validating the platform with the exchange of more than 100 disinformation incidents.</description>

      <title>Hessian-aware Training for Enhancing DNNs Resilience to Parameter Corruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are not resilient to parameter corruptions: even a single-bitwise error in their parameters in memory can cause an accuracy drop of over 10%, and in the worst cases, up to 99%. This susceptibility poses great challenges in deploying models on computing platforms, where adversaries can induce bit-flips through software or bitwise corruptions may occur naturally. Most prior work addresses this issue with hardware or system-level approaches, such as integrating additional hardware components to verify a model's integrity at inference. However, these methods have not been widely deployed as they require infrastructure or platform-wide modifications.
  In this paper, we propose a new approach to addressing this issue: training models to be more resilient to bitwise corruptions to their parameters. Our approach, Hessian-aware training, promotes models with $flatter$ loss surfaces. We show that, while there have been training methods, designed to improve generalization through Hessian-based approaches, they do not enhance resilience to parameter corruptions. In contrast, models trained with our method demonstrate increased resilience to parameter corruptions, particularly with a 20$-$50% reduction in the number of bits whose individual flipping leads to a 90$-$100% accuracy drop. Moreover, we show the synergy between ours and existing hardware and system-level defenses.</description>

      <title>How does Watermarking Affect Visual Language Models in Document Understanding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have become foundational models for document understanding tasks, widely used in the processing of complex multimodal documents across domains such as finance, law, and academia. However, documents often contain noise-like information, such as watermarks, which inevitably leads us to inquire: \emph{Do watermarks degrade the performance of VLMs in document understanding?} To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to investigate the effect of visible watermarks on VLMs performance. We takes into account various factors, including different types of document data, the positions of watermarks within documents and variations in watermark content. Our experimental results reveal that VLMs performance can be significantly compromised by watermarks, with performance drop rates reaching up to 36\%. We discover that \emph{scattered} watermarks cause stronger interference than centralized ones, and that \emph{semantic contents} in watermarks creates greater disruption than simple visual occlusion. Through attention mechanism analysis and embedding similarity examination, we find that the performance drops are mainly attributed to that watermarks 1) force widespread attention redistribution, and 2) alter semantic representation in the embedding space. Our research not only highlights significant challenges in deploying VLMs for document understanding, but also provides insights towards developing robust inference mechanisms on watermarked documents.</description>

      <title>Multilingual and Multi-Accent Jailbreaking of Audio LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced audio understanding but introduce critical security risks, particularly through audio jailbreaks. While prior work has focused on English-centric attacks, we expose a far more severe vulnerability: adversarial multilingual and multi-accent audio jailbreaks, where linguistic and acoustic variations dramatically amplify attack success. In this paper, we introduce Multi-AudioJail, the first systematic framework to exploit these vulnerabilities through (1) a novel dataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual/multi-accent audio jailbreaking prompts, and (2) a hierarchical evaluation pipeline revealing that how acoustic perturbations (e.g., reverberation, echo, and whisper effects) interacts with cross-lingual phonetics to cause jailbreak success rates (JSRs) to surge by up to +57.25 percentage points (e.g., reverberated Kenyan-accented attack on MERaLiON). Crucially, our work further reveals that multimodal LLMs are inherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems: attackers need only exploit the weakest link (e.g., non-English audio inputs) to compromise the entire model, which we empirically show by multilingual audio-only attacks achieving 3.1x higher success rates than text-only attacks. We plan to release our dataset to spur research into cross-modal defenses, urging the community to address this expanding attack surface in multimodality as LALMs evolve.</description>

      <title>Representation Bending for Large Language Model Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, but their inherent safety risks - ranging from harmful content generation to broader societal harms - pose significant challenges. These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering - simple vector arithmetic for steering model's behavior during inference - to loss-based fine-tuning. Through extensive evaluation, RepBend achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods such as Circuit Breaker, RMU, and NPO, with up to 95% reduction in attack success rates across diverse jailbreak benchmarks, all with negligible reduction in model usability and general capabilities.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Leader Election and Collective Coin Flipping, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the tasks of collective coin flipping and leader election in the full-information model.
  We prove new lower bounds for coin flipping protocols, implying lower bounds for leader election protocols. We show that any $k$-round coin flipping protocol, where each of $\ell$ players sends 1 bit per round, can be biased by $O(\ell/\log^{(k)}(\ell))$ bad players. For all $k&gt;1$ this strengthens previous lower bounds [RSZ, SICOMP 2002], which ruled out protocols resilient to adversaries controlling $O(\ell/\log^{(2k-1)}(\ell))$ players. Consequently, we establish that any protocol tolerating a linear fraction of corrupt players, with only 1 bit per round, must run for at least $\log^*\ell-O(1)$ rounds, improving on the prior best lower bound of $\frac12 \log^*\ell-\log^*\log^*\ell$. This lower bound matches the number of rounds, $\log^*\ell$, taken by the current best coin flipping protocols from [RZ, JCSS 2001], [F, FOCS 1999] that can handle a linear sized coalition of bad players, but with players sending unlimited bits per round. We also derive lower bounds for protocols allowing multi-bit messages per round. Our results show that the protocols from [RZ, JCSS 2001], [F, FOCS 1999] that handle a linear number of corrupt players are almost optimal in terms of round complexity and communication per player in a round.
  A key technical ingredient in proving our lower bounds is a new result regarding biasing most functions from a family of functions using a common set of bad players and a small specialized set of bad players specific to each function that is biased.
  We give improved constant-round coin flipping protocols in the setting that each player can send 1 bit per round. For two rounds, our protocol can handle $O(\ell/(\log\ell)(\log\log\ell)^2)$ sized coalition of bad players; better than the best one-round protocol by [AL, Combinatorica 1993] in this setting.</description>

      <title>Accelerating IoV Intrusion Detection: Benchmarking GPU-Accelerated vs CPU-Based ML Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) may face challenging cybersecurity attacks that may require sophisticated intrusion detection systems, necessitating a rapid development and response system. This research investigates the performance advantages of GPU-accelerated libraries (cuML) compared to traditional CPU-based implementations (scikit-learn), focusing on the speed and efficiency required for machine learning models used in IoV threat detection environments. The comprehensive evaluations conducted employ four machine learning approaches (Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) across three distinct IoV security datasets (OTIDS, GIDS, CICIoV2024). Our findings demonstrate that GPU-accelerated implementations dramatically improved computational efficiency, with training times reduced by a factor of up to 159 and prediction speeds accelerated by up to 95 times compared to traditional CPU processing, all while preserving detection accuracy. This remarkable performance breakthrough empowers researchers and security specialists to harness GPU acceleration for creating faster, more effective threat detection systems that meet the urgent real-time security demands of today's connected vehicle networks.</description>

      <title>GTree: GPU-Friendly Privacy-preserving Decision Tree Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision tree (DT) is a widely used machine learning model due to its versatility, speed, and interpretability. However, for privacy-sensitive applications, outsourcing DT training and inference to cloud platforms raise concerns about data privacy. Researchers have developed privacy-preserving approaches for DT training and inference using cryptographic primitives, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). While these approaches have shown progress, they still suffer from heavy computation and communication overheads. Few recent works employ Graphical Processing Units (GPU) to improve the performance of MPC-protected deep learning. This raises a natural question: \textit{can MPC-protected DT training and inference be accelerated by GPU?}
  We present GTree, the first scheme that uses GPU to accelerate MPC-protected secure DT training and inference. GTree is built across 3 parties who securely and jointly perform each step of DT training and inference with GPU. Each MPC protocol in GTree is designed in a GPU-friendly version. The performance evaluation shows that GTree achieves ${\thicksim}11{\times}$ and ${\thicksim}21{\times}$ improvements in training SPECT and Adult datasets, compared to the prior most efficient CPU-based work. For inference, GTree shows its superior efficiency when the DT has less than 10 levels, which is $126\times$ faster than the prior most efficient work when inferring $10^4$ instances with a tree of 7 levels. GTree also achieves a stronger security guarantee than prior solutions, which only leaks the tree depth and size of data samples while prior solutions also leak the tree structure. With \textit{oblivious array access}, the access pattern on GPU is also protected.</description>

      <title>In Pursuit of Privacy: The Value-Centered Privacy Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many users make quick decisions that affect their data privacy without due consideration of their values. One such decision is whether to download a smartphone app to their device. Previous work has suggested a relationship between values, privacy preferences, and app choices, and proposed a value-centered approach to privacy that conceptually unites these relationships. In this work, we translate this theory into practice by constructing a prototype smartphone value-centered privacy assistant (VcPA) - a privacy assistant system that promotes user privacy decisions based on personal values. To do this, we designed and conducted an online survey that captured values and privacy preferences when considering whether to download an app from 273 smartphone users. Using this data, we constructed VcPA user profiles by clustering survey data based on the value rankings and stated privacy preferences. We then tested the VcPA, using selective notices, a "suggest alternatives" feature, and exploratory notices, with 77 users in a synthetic Mock App Store (MAS) setting and conducted follow-up semi-structured interviews. We establish proof-of-concept that a VcPA helps users make more value-centered app choices and identified improvements so that an assistant can be deployed on smartphone app stores.</description>

      <title>Split Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10422v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Split Unlearning, a novel machine unlearning technology designed for Split Learning (SL), enabling the first-ever implementation of Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA) unlearning in SL frameworks. Particularly, the tight coupling between clients and the server in existing SL frameworks results in frequent bidirectional data flows and iterative training across all clients, violating the "Isolated" principle and making them struggle to implement SISA for independent and efficient unlearning. To address this, we propose SplitWiper with a new one-way-one-off propagation scheme, which leverages the inherently "Sharded" structure of SL and decouples neural signal propagation between clients and the server, enabling effective SISA unlearning even in scenarios with absent clients. We further design SplitWiper+ to enhance client label privacy, which integrates differential privacy and label expansion strategy to defend the privacy of client labels against the server and other potential adversaries. Experiments across diverse data distributions and tasks demonstrate that SplitWiper achieves 0% accuracy for unlearned labels, and 8% better accuracy for retained labels than non-SISA unlearning in SL. Moreover, the one-way-one-off propagation maintains constant overhead, reducing computational and communication costs by 99%. SplitWiper+ preserves 90% of label privacy when sharing masked labels with the server.</description>

      <title>LookAhead: Preventing DeFi Attacks via Unveiling Adversarial Contracts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) incidents stemming from the exploitation of smart contract vulnerabilities have culminated in financial damages exceeding 3 billion US dollars. Existing defense mechanisms typically focus on detecting and reacting to malicious transactions executed by attackers that target victim contracts. However, with the emergence of private transaction pools where transactions are sent directly to miners without first appearing in public mempools, current detection tools face significant challenges in identifying attack activities effectively. Based on the fact that most attack logic rely on deploying one or more intermediate smart contracts as supporting components to the exploitation of victim contracts, detection methods have been proposed that focus on identifying these adversarial contracts instead of adversarial transactions. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches in this direction have failed to produce results satisfactory enough for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a new framework for effectively detecting DeFi attacks via unveiling adversarial contracts. Our approach allows us to leverage common attack patterns, code semantics and intrinsic characteristics found in malicious smart contracts to build the LookAhead system based on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and a transformer model that is able to effectively distinguish adversarial contracts from benign ones, and make timely predictions of different types of potential attacks. Experiments show that LookAhead achieves an F1-score as high as 0.8966, which represents an improvement of over 44.4% compared to the previous state-of-the-art solution Forta, with a False Positive Rate (FPR) at only 0.16%.</description>

      <title>TokenMark: A Modality-Agnostic Watermark for Pre-trained Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Watermarking is a critical tool for model ownership verification. However, existing watermarking techniques are often designed for specific data modalities and downstream tasks, without considering the inherent architectural properties of the model. This lack of generality and robustness underscores the need for a more versatile watermarking approach. In this work, we investigate the properties of Transformer models and propose TokenMark, a modality-agnostic, robust watermarking system for pre-trained models, leveraging the permutation equivariance property. TokenMark embeds the watermark by fine-tuning the pre-trained model on a set of specifically permuted data samples, resulting in a watermarked model that contains two distinct sets of weights -- one for normal functionality and the other for watermark extraction, the latter triggered only by permuted inputs. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art pre-trained models demonstrate that TokenMark significantly improves the robustness, efficiency, and universality of model watermarking, highlighting its potential as a unified watermarking solution.</description>

      <title>Preventing Radio Fingerprinting through Low-Power Jamming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency fingerprinting enables a passive receiver to recognize and authenticate a transmitter without the need for cryptographic tools. Authentication is achieved by isolating specific features of the transmitted signal that are unique to the transmitter's hardware. Much research has focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of radio frequency fingerprinting to maximize its performance in various scenarios and conditions, while little research examined how to protect devices from being subject to radio fingerprinting in the wild.
  In this paper, we explore a novel point of view. We examine the threat posed by radio frequency fingerprinting, which facilitates the unauthorized identification of wireless devices in the field by malicious entities. We also suggest a method to sanitize the transmitted signal of its fingerprint using a low-power jammer, deployed on purpose to improve devices' anonymity on the channel while still guaranteeing the link's quality of service. Our experimental results and subsequent analysis demonstrate that a low-power jammer can effectively block a malicious eavesdropper from identifying a device without affecting the quality of the wireless link, thereby restoring the privacy of the user when accessing the radio spectrum.</description>

      <title>Private Synthetic Data Generation in Small Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose $\mathtt{PrivHP}$, a lightweight synthetic data generator with \textit{differential privacy} guarantees. $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses a novel hierarchical decomposition that approximates the input's cumulative distribution function (CDF) in bounded memory. It balances hierarchy depth, noise addition, and pruning of low-frequency subdomains while preserving frequent ones. Private sketches estimate subdomain frequencies efficiently without full data access.
  A key feature is the pruning parameter $k$, which controls the trade-off between space and utility. We define the skew measure $\mathtt{tail}_k$, capturing all but the top $k$ subdomain frequencies. Given a dataset $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathtt{PrivHP}$ uses $M=\mathcal{O}(k\log^2 |X|)$ space and, for input domain $\Omega = [0,1]$, ensures $\varepsilon$-differential privacy. It yields a generator with expected Wasserstein distance: \[ \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log^2 M}{\varepsilon n} + \frac{||\mathtt{tail}_k(\mathcal{X})||_1}{M n}\right) \] from the empirical distribution. This parameterized trade-off offers a level of flexibility unavailable in prior work. We also provide interpretable utility bounds that account for hierarchy depth, privacy noise, pruning, and frequency estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Kite: How to Delegate Voting Power Privately</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the privacy of votes in an election is crucial for the integrity of a democratic process. Often, voting power is delegated to representatives (e.g., in congress) who subsequently vote on behalf of voters on specific issues. This delegation model is also widely used in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Although several existing voting systems used in DAOs support private voting, they only offer public delegation. In this paper, we introduce Kite, a new protocol that enables $\textit{private}$ delegation of voting power for DAO members. Voters can freely delegate, revoke, and re-delegate their power without revealing any information about who they delegated to. Even the delegate does not learn who delegated to them. The only information that is recorded publicly is that the voter delegated or re-delegated their vote to someone. Kite accommodates both public and private voting for the delegates themselves. We analyze the security of our protocol within the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We implement Kite as an extension to the existing Governor Bravo smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, that is widely used for DAO governance. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of our implementation that demonstrates the practicality of the protocol. The most expensive operation is delegation due to the required zero-knowledge proofs. On a consumer-grade laptop, delegation takes between 7 and 167 seconds depending on the requested level of privacy.</description>

      <title>Local Differential Privacy for Tensors in Distributed Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor-valued data, increasingly common in distributed big data applications like autonomous driving and smart healthcare, poses unique challenges for privacy protection due to its multidimensional structure and the risk of losing critical structural information. Traditional local differential privacy methods, designed for scalars and matrices, are insufficient for tensors, as they fail to preserve essential relationships among tensor elements. We introduce TLDP, a novel LDP algorithm for Tensors, which employs a randomized response mechanism to perturb tensor components while maintaining structural integrity. To strike a better balance between utility and privacy, we incorporate a weight matrix that selectively protects sensitive regions. Both theoretical analysis and empirical findings from real-world datasets show that TLDP achieves superior utility while preserving privacy, making it a robust solution for high-dimensional tensor data.</description>

      <title>No, of course I can! Refusal Mechanisms Can Be Exploited Using Harmless Fine-Tuning Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Google offer fine-tuning APIs that allow customers to adapt LMs for specific use cases. To prevent misuse, these LM providers implement filtering mechanisms to block harmful fine-tuning data. Consequently, adversaries seeking to produce unsafe LMs via these APIs must craft adversarial training data that are not identifiably harmful. We make three contributions in this context: 1. We show that many existing attacks that use harmless data to create unsafe LMs rely on eliminating model refusals in the first few tokens of their responses. 2. We show that such prior attacks can be blocked by a simple defense that pre-fills the first few tokens from an aligned model before letting the fine-tuned model fill in the rest. 3. We describe a new data-poisoning attack, ``No, Of course I Can Execute'' (NOICE), which exploits an LM's formulaic refusal mechanism to elicit harmful responses. By training an LM to refuse benign requests on the basis of safety before fulfilling those requests regardless, we are able to jailbreak several open-source models and a closed-source model (GPT-4o). We show an attack success rate (ASR) of 57% against GPT-4o; our attack earned a Bug Bounty from OpenAI. Against open-source models protected by simple defenses, we improve ASRs by an average of 3.25 times compared to the best performing previous attacks that use only harmless data. NOICE demonstrates the exploitability of repetitive refusal mechanisms and broadens understanding of the threats closed-source models face from harmless data.</description>

      <title>CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications. This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Towards a Blockchain and Opportunistic Edge Driven Metaverse of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Metaverses, built on Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 technologies, have attracted significant attention across various fields. This innovation leverages blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Extended Reality (XR) and advanced technologies to create immersive and interconnected digital environments that mirror the real world. This article delves into the Metaverse of Everything (MoE), a platform that fuses the Metaverse concept with the Internet of Everything (IoE), an advanced version of the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects not only physical devices but also people, data and processes within a networked environment. Thus, the MoE integrates generated data and virtual entities, creating an extensive network of interconnected components. This article seeks to advance current MoE, examining decentralization and the application of Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) for interactions with surrounding IoT devices and IoE entities. Moreover, it outlines the main challenges to guide researchers and businesses towards building a future cyber-resilient opportunistic MoE.</description>

      <title>On-Chain Analysis of Smart Contract Dependency Risks on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of smart contract dependencies, analyzing over 41 million contracts and 11 billion interactions on Ethereum up to December 2024. Our results yield four key insights: (1) 59% of contract transactions involve multiple contracts (median of 4 per transaction in 2024) indicating potential smart contract dependency risks; (2) the ecosystem exhibits extreme centralization, with just 11 (0.001%) deployers controlling 20.5 million (50%) of alive contracts, with major risks related to factory contracts and deployer privileges; (3) three most depended-upon contracts are mutable, meaning large parts of the ecosystem rely on contracts that can be altered at any time, which is a significant risk, (4) actual smart contract protocol dependencies are significantly more complex than officially documented, undermining Ethereum's transparency ethos, and creating unnecessary attack surface. Our work provides the first large-scale empirical foundation for understanding smart contract dependency risks, offering crucial insights for developers, users, and security researchers in the blockchain space.</description>
