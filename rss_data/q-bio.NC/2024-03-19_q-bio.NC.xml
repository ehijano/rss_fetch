      <title>Brain volume is a better biomarker of outcomes in ischemic stroke compared to brain atrophy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) has been used as a surrogate measure of global brain atrophy, and as a biomarker of brain reserve in studies evaluating clinical outcomes after brain injury. Total brain volume at the time of injury has recently been shown to influence functional outcomes, where larger brain volumes are associated with better outcomes. Here, we assess if brain volume at the time of ischemic stroke injury is a better biomarker of functional outcome than BPF. Acute ischemic stroke cases at a single center between 2003 and 2011, with MR neuroimaging obtained within 48 hours from presentation were eligible. Functional outcomes represented by the modified Rankin Score (mRS) at 90 days post admission (mRS&lt;3 deemed a favorable outcome) were obtained via patient interview or per chart review. Deep learning enabled automated segmentation pipelines were used to calculate brain volume, intracranial volume (ICV), and BPF on the acute neuroimaging data. Patient outcomes were modeled through logistic regressions, and model comparison was conducted using the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC). 467 patients with arterial ischemic stroke were included in the analysis. Median age was 65.8 years, and 65.3% were male. In both models, age and a larger stroke lesion volume were associated with worse functional outcomes. Higher BPF and a larger brain volume were both associated with favorable functional outcomes, however, comparison of both models suggested that the brain volume model (BIC=501) explains the data better compared to the BPF model (BIC=511). The extent of global brain atrophy has been regarded as an important biomarker of post-stroke functional outcomes and resilience to acute injury. Here, we demonstrate that a higher global brain volume at the time of injury better explains favorable functional outcomes, which can be directly clinically assessed.</description>

      <title>When Does Your Brain Know You? Segment Length and Its Impact on EEG-based Biometric Authentication Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest for optimal EEG-based biometric authentication, this study investigates the pivotal balance for accurate identification without sacrificing performance or adding unnecessary computational complexity. Through a methodical exploration of segment durations, and employing a variety of sophisticated machine learning models, the research seeks to pinpoint a threshold where EEG data provides maximum informational yield for authentication purposes. The findings are set to advance the field of non-invasive biometric technologies, proposing a practical approach to secure and user-friendly identity verification systems while also raising considerations for the real-world application of EEG-based biometric authentication beyond controlled environments.</description>

      <title>Emergence of dynamical networks in termites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Termites form complex dynamical trail networks from simple individual rules when exploring their environment. To help identify those simple rules, we reconstructed trail networks from time-lapse images of roaming termites. We quantified the trails' frequentations over time and compared them to the ones obtained by a null model. Arena borders were preferred in both simulated and observed data. Yet, the amplification phenomenon was higher with real termites, underlining the role of pheromones.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for learning through structural plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing body of research indicates that structural plasticity mechanisms are crucial for learning and memory consolidation. Starting from a simple phenomenological model, we exploit a mean-field approach to develop a theoretical framework of learning through this kind of plasticity, capable of taking into account several features of the connectivity and pattern of activity of biological neural networks, including probability distributions of neuron firing rates, selectivity of the responses of single neurons to multiple stimuli, probabilistic connection rules and noisy stimuli. More importantly, it describes the effects of stabilization, pruning and reorganization of synaptic connections. This framework is used to compute the values of some relevant quantities used to characterize the learning and memory capabilities of the neuronal network in training and testing procedures as the number of training patterns and other model parameters vary. The results are then compared with those obtained through simulations with firing-rate-based neuronal network models.</description>
