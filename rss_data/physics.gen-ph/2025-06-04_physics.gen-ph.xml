      <title>The Galactic Pizza: Flat Rotation Curves in the Context of Cosmological Time-Energy Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of augmented gravity on the scale of galaxies, conventionally attributed to dark matter halos, is shown to possibly result from the incremental growth of galactic masses and radii over time. This approach elucidates the cosmological origins of the acceleration scale $a_0\approx cH_0/2\pi\approx10^{-10}$ms$^{-2}$ at which galaxy rotation curves deviate from Keplerian behavior, with no need for new particles or modifications to the laws of gravity, i.e., it constitutes a new explanatory path beyond Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Once one formally equates the energy density of the universe to the critical value ($\rho=\rho_c$) and the cosmic age to the reciprocal of the Hubble parameter ($t=H^{-1}$), independently of the epoch of observation, the result is the Zero-Energy condition for the cosmic fluid's equation of state, with key repercussions for the study of dark energy since the observables can be explained in the absence of a cosmological constant. Furthermore, this mass-energy evolution framework is able to reconcile the success of CDM models in describing structure assembly at $z\lesssim6$ with the unexpected discovery of massive objects at $z\gtrsim10$. Models that feature a strong coupling between cosmic time and energy are favored by this analysis.</description>

      <title>Computational complexity of spin-glass three-dimensional (3D) Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the computational complexity of a spin-glass three-dimensional (3D) Ising model (for the lattice size N = lmn, where l, m, n are the numbers of lattice points along three crystallographic directions) is studied. We prove that an absolute minimum core (AMC) model consisting of a spin-glass 2D Ising model interacting with its nearest neighboring plane, has its computational complexity O(2^mn). Any algorithms to make the model smaller (or simpler) than the AMC model will cut the basic element of the spin-glass 3D Ising model and lost many important information of the original model. Therefore, the computational complexity of the spin-glass 3D Ising model cannot be reduced to be less than O(2^mn) by any algorithms, which is in subexponential time, superpolynomial.</description>
