      <title>A TVD neural network closure and application to turbulent combustion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trained neural networks (NN) have attractive features for closing governing equations, but in the absence of additional constraints, they can stray from physical reality. A NN formulation is introduced to preclude spurious oscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is embedded in the discretized equations as a machine learning closure and strictly constrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during gradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto an explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure model usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and anti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model is applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for which it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise violate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of oscillations in the loss function.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Surrogate Model for Accelerating the Design of Electric Vehicle Battery Enclosures for Crash Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic surrogate model for the accelerated design of electric vehicle battery enclosures with a focus on crash performance. The study integrates high-throughput finite element simulations and Gaussian Process Regression to develop a surrogate model that predicts crash parameters with high accuracy while providing uncertainty estimates. The model was trained using data generated from thermoforming and crash simulations over a range of material and process parameters. Validation against new simulation data demonstrated the model's predictive accuracy with mean absolute percentage errors within 8.08% for all output variables. Additionally, a Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation study revealed the impact of input variability on outputs. The results highlight the efficacy of the Gaussian Process Regression model in capturing complex relationships within the dataset, offering a robust and efficient tool for the design optimization of composite battery enclosures.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins and Civil Engineering Phases: Reorienting Adoption Strategies</title>

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has received immense attention over the years due to the promises it presents to various stakeholders in science and engineering. As a result, different thematic areas of DT have been explored. This is no different in specific fields such as manufacturing, automation, oil and gas, and civil engineering, leading to fragmented approaches for field-specific applications. The civil engineering industry is further disadvantaged in this regard as it relies on external techniques by other engineering fields for its DT adoption. A rising consequence of these extensions is a concentrated application of DT to the operations and maintenance phase. On another spectrum, Building Information Modeling (BIM) is pervasively utilized in the planning/design phase, and the transient nature of the construction phase remains a challenge for its DT adoption. In this paper, we present a phase-based development of DT in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry. We commence by presenting succinct expositions on DT as a concept and as a service, and establish a five-level scale system. Furthermore, we present separately a systematic literature review of the conventional techniques employed at each civil engineering phase. In this regard, we identified enabling technologies such as computer vision for extended sensing and the Internet of Things for reliable integration. Ultimately, we attempt to reveal DT as an important tool across the entire life cycle of civil engineering projects, and nudge researchers to think more holistically in their quest for the integration of DT for civil engineering applications.</description>

      <title>DeepOKAN: Deep Operator Network Based on Kolmogorov Arnold Networks for Mechanics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern digital engineering design often requires costly repeated simulations for different scenarios. The prediction capability of neural networks (NNs) makes them suitable surrogates for providing design insights. However, only a few NNs can efficiently handle complex engineering scenario predictions. We introduce a new version of the neural operators called DeepOKAN, which utilizes Kolmogorov Arnold networks (KANs) rather than the conventional neural network architectures. Our DeepOKAN uses Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) rather than the B-splines. RBFs offer good approximation properties and are typically computationally fast. The KAN architecture, combined with RBFs, allows DeepOKANs to represent better intricate relationships between input parameters and output fields, resulting in more accurate predictions across various mechanics problems. Specifically, we evaluate DeepOKAN's performance on several mechanics problems, including 1D sinusoidal waves, 2D orthotropic elasticity, and transient Poisson's problem, consistently achieving lower training losses and more accurate predictions compared to traditional DeepONets. This approach should pave the way for further improving the performance of neural operators.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and price impact in the fluid-limit of an order book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a Discrete Time Random Walk (DTRW) numerical scheme to simulate the anomalous diffusion of financial market orders in a simulated order book. Here using random walks with Sibuya waiting times to include a time-dependent stochastic forcing function with non-uniformly sampled times between order book events in the setting of fractional diffusion. This models the fluid limit of an order book by modelling the continuous arrival, cancellation and diffusion of orders in the presence of information shocks. We study the impulse response and stylised facts of orders undergoing anomalous diffusion for different forcing functions and model parameters. Concretely, we demonstrate the price impact for flash limit-orders and market orders and show how the numerical method generate kinks in the price impact. We use cubic spline interpolation to generate smoothed price impact curves. The work promotes the use of non-uniform sampling in the presence of diffusive dynamics as the preferred simulation method.</description>

      <title>Topological Separation of Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortices and their analysis play a critical role in the understanding of complex phenomena in turbulent flows. Traditional vortex extraction methods, notably region-based techniques, often overlook the entanglement phenomenon, resulting in the inclusion of multiple vortices within a single extracted region. Their separation is necessary for quantifying different types of vortices and their statistics. In this study, we propose a novel vortex separation method that extends the conventional contour tree-based segmentation approach with an additional step termed "layering". Upon extracting a vortical region using specified vortex criteria (e.g., $\lambda_2$), we initially establish topological segmentation based on the contour tree, followed by the layering process to allocate appropriate segmentation IDs to unsegmented cells, thus separating individual vortices within the region. However, these regions may still suffer from inaccurate splits, which we address statistically by leveraging the continuity of vorticity lines across the split boundaries. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both the separation of vortices and the mitigation of inaccurate splits compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>INSIGHT: Universal Neural Simulator for Analog Circuits Harnessing Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog front-end design heavily relies on specialized human expertise and costly trial-and-error simulations, which motivated many prior works on analog design automation. However, efficient and effective exploration of the vast and complex design space remains constrained by the time-consuming nature of SPICE simulations, making effective design automation a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we introduce INSIGHT, a GPU-powered, technology-agnostic, effective universal neural simulator in the analog front-end design automation loop. INSIGHT accurately predicts the performance metrics of analog circuits across various technologies with just a few microseconds of inference time. Notably, its autoregressive capabilities enable INSIGHT to accurately predict simulation-costly critical transient specifications leveraging less expensive performance metric information. The low cost and high fidelity feature make INSIGHT a good substitute for standard simulators in analog front-end optimization frameworks. INSIGHT is compatible with any optimization framework, facilitating enhanced design space exploration for sample efficiency through sophisticated offline learning and adaptation techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that INSIGHT-M, a model-based batch reinforcement learning sizing framework with INSIGHT as the accurate surrogate, only requires &lt; 20 real-time simulations with 100-1000x lower simulation costs and significant speedup over existing sizing methods.</description>
