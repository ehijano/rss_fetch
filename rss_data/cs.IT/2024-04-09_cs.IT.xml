      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Ziv-Zakai Lower Bounds on the MMSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the Ziv-Zakai (ZZ) family. The ZZ technique relies on connecting the bound to an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. Three versions of the ZZ bound (ZZB) exist: the first relies on the so-called valley-filling function (VFF), the second omits the VFF, and the third, i.e., the single-point ZZB (SZZB), uses a single point maximization. The first part of this paper provides the most general version of the bounds. First, it is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. Second, the SZZB bound is extended to an M-ary setting and a version of it for the multivariate case is provided. In the second part, general properties of the bounds are provided. First, it is shown that all the bounds tensorize. Second, a complete characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, the low-noise asymptotic is provided for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Specifically, in the low-noise, it is shown that the SZZB is not always tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB bound without the VFF is tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs, the ZZB with the VFF is shown to be always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the VFF. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are shown in which the bounds in the ZZ family outperform other well-known Bayesian bounds, i.e., the Cram\'er-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Optical Fiber MIMO Channels With Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technique is regarded as a promising approach to boost the throughput and reliability of optical fiber communications. However, the fundamental limits of optical fiber MIMO systems with finite block-length (FBL) are not available in the literature. This paper studies the fundamental limits of optical fiber multicore/multimode systems in the FBL regime when the coding rate is a perturbation within $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{ML}})$ of the capacity, where M and L represent the number of transmit channels and blocklength, respectively. Considering the Jacobi MIMO channel, which was proposed to model the nearly lossless propagation and the crosstalks in optical fiber systems, we derive the upper and lower bounds for the optimal error probability. For that purpose, we first set up the central limit theorem for the information density in the asymptotic regime where the number of transmit, receive, available channels and the blocklength go to infinity at the same pace. The result is then utilized to derive the upper and lower bounds for the optimal average error probability with the concerned rate. The derived theoretical results reveal interesting physical insights for Jacobi MIMO channels with FBL. First, the derived bounds for Jacobi channels degenerate to those for Rayleigh channels when the number of available channels approaches infinity. Second, the high signal-to-noise (SNR) approximation indicates that a larger number of available channels results in a larger error probability. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and show that the derived bounds are closer to the performance of practical LDPC codes than outage probability.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically-Consistent Modeling and Optimization of Mutual Coupling in RIS-Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual Coupling (MC) is an unavoidable feature in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) with sub-wavelength inter-element spacing. Its inherent presence naturally leads to non-local RIS structures, which can be efficiently described via non-diagonal phase shift matrices. In this paper, we focus on optimizing MC in RIS-assisted multi-user MIMO wireless communication systems. We particularly formulate a novel problem to jointly optimize active and passive beamforming as well as MC in a physically consistent manner. To characterize MC, we deploy scattering parameters and propose a novel approach to optimize them through an offline optimization method, rather than optimizing MC on the fly. Our numerical results showcase that the system performance increases with the proposed MC optimization, and this improvement is achievable without the need for optimizing MC on-the-fly, which can be rather cumbersome.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Uncertainty Quantification and Optimization of Horn Antennas at SubTHz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-terahertz (subTHz) antennas will play an important role in the next generations of wireless communication systems. However, when comes to the subTHz frequency spectrum, the antenna fabrication tolerance needs to be accurately considered during the design stage. The classic approach to studying the average performance of an antenna design considering fabrication tolerances is through the use of the Monte-Carlo (MC) method. In this paper, we propose an adaptive polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method for the uncertainty quantification analysis of subTHz horn antennas with flat-top radiation patterns. The proposed method builds a surrogate model of the antenna's response to electromagnetic (EM) excitation and estimates its statistical moments with accuracy close to the reference MC method, but with a much smaller computational complexity of roughly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the surrogate model based on PCE can substitute full-wave EM solvers in producing samples for electromagnetic quantities of interest, resulting in significant computational efficiency gains during optimization tasks. To this end, we successfully combined PCE with the particle swarm optimization method to design the free parameters of a horn antenna at $95$ GHz for a flat-top gain.</description>

      <title>Study of Adaptive Reweighted Sparse Belief Propagation Decoders for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an adaptive reweighted sparse belief propagation (AR-SBP) decoder for polar codes. The AR-SBP technique is inspired by decoders that employ the sum-product algorithm for low-density parity-check codes. In particular, the AR-SBP decoding strategy introduces reweighting of the exchanged log-likelihood-ratio in order to refine the message passing, improving the performance of the decoder and reducing the number of required iterations. An analysis of the convergence of AR-SBP is carried out along with a study of the complexity of the analyzed decoders. Numerical examples show that the AR-SBP decoder outperforms existing decoding algorithms for a reduced number of iterations, enabling low-latency applications.</description>

      <title>Computation and Critical Transitions of Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions With Wasserstein Barycenter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information rate-distortion-perception (RDP) function characterizes the three-way trade-off between description rate, average distortion, and perceptual quality measured by discrepancy between probability distributions. We study several variants of the RDP functions through the lens of optimal transport. By transforming the information RDP function into a Wasserstein Barycenter problem, we identify the critical transitions when one of the constraints becomes inactive and demonstrate several critical transition properties of the RDP variants. Further, the non-strictly convexity brought by the perceptual constraint can be regularized by an entropy regularization term. We prove that the entropy regularized model converges to the original problem and propose an alternating iteration method based on the Sinkhorn algorithm to numerically solve the regularized optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithms. As a practical application of our theory, we incorporate our numerical method into a reverse data hiding problem, where a secret message is imperceptibly embedded into the image with guarantees of the perceptual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Soft-in Soft-out Decoding of Spherical Codes from Cartesian Powers of PAM Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For applications in concatenated coding for optical communications systems, we examine the encoding and soft-decoding of short spherical codes constructed as constant-energy shells of the Cartesian power of pulse amplitude modulation constellations. These are unions of permutation codes having the same average power. We construct a list decoder for permutation codes by adapting Murty's algorithm, which is then used to determine mutual information curves for these permutation codes. In the process, we discover a straightforward expression for determining the likelihood of large subcodes of permutation codes. We refer to these subcodes, obtained by all possible sign flips of a given permutation codeword, as orbits. We introduce a simple process, which we call orbit decoding with frozen symbols, that allows us to extract soft information from noisy permutation codewords. In a sample communication system with probabilistic amplitude shaping protected by a standard low-density parity-check code that employs short permutation codes, we demonstrate that orbit decoding with frozen symbols provides a gain of about 0.3 dB in signal-to-noise ratio compared to the traditional symbol-by-symbol decoding. By using spherical codes composed of unions of permutation codes, we can increase the input entropy compared to using permutation codes alone. In one scheme, we consider a union of a small number of permutation codes. In this case, orbit decoding with frozen symbols provides about 0.2 dB gain compared to the traditional method. In another scheme, we use all possible permutations to form a spherical code that exhibits a computationally feasible trellis representation. The soft information obtained using the BCJR algorithm outperforms the traditional symbol-by-symbol method by 0.1 dB.</description>

      <title>Fourier Transform-based Wavenumber Domain 3D Imaging in RIS-aided Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio imaging is rapidly gaining prominence in the design of future communication systems, with the potential to utilize reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as imaging apertures. Although the sparsity of targets in three-dimensional (3D) space has led most research to adopt compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging algorithms, these often require substantial computational and memory burdens. Drawing inspiration from conventional Fourier transform (FT)-based imaging methods, our research seeks to accelerate radio imaging in RIS-aided communication systems. To begin, we introduce a two-stage wavenumber domain 3D imaging technique: first, we modify RIS phase shifts to recover the equivalent channel response from the user equipment to the RIS array, subsequently employing traditional FT-based wavenumber domain methods to produce target images. We also determine the diffraction resolution limits of the system through k-space analysis, taking into account factors including system bandwidth, transmission direction, operating frequency, and the angle subtended by the RIS. Addressing the challenge of limited pilots in communication systems, we unveil an innovative algorithm that merges the strengths of both FT- and CS-based techniques by substituting the expansive sensing matrix with FT-based operators. Our simulation outcomes confirm that our proposed FT-based methods achieve high-quality images while demanding few time, memory, and communication resources.</description>

      <title>Single-Server Pliable Private Information Retrieval with Identifiable Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Pliable Private Information Retrieval (PPIR) with a single server, messages are partitioned into $\Gamma$ non-overlapping classes \cite{ref5}. The user wants to retrieve a message from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class to the server. In \cite{ref6}, Obead et al. consider the problem of PPIR with Side Information (PPIR-SI), where the user now has side information. The user wants to retrieve any new message (not included in the side information) from its desired class without revealing the identity of the desired class and its side information. A scheme for the PPIR-SI is given in \cite{ref6} for the case when the users side information is unidentified, and this case is referred to as PPIR with Unidentifiable SI (PPIR-USI). In this paper, we study the problem of PPIR for the single server case when the side information is partially identifiable, and we term this case as PPIR with Identifiable Side Information (PPIR-ISI). The user is well aware of the identity of the side information belonging to $\eta$ number of classes, where $1\leq \eta \leq \Gamma$. We give a scheme for PPIR-ISI, and we prove that having identifiable side information is advantageous by comparing the rate of the proposed scheme to the rate of the PPIR-USI scheme given in \cite{ref6} for some cases. Further, we extend the problem of PPIR-ISI for multi-user case, where users can collaboratively generate the query sets, and we give a scheme for this problem.</description>

      <title>Analog-Digital Beam Focusing for Line of Sight Wide-Aperture MIMO with Spherical Wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing high-speed wireless communication in the future relies significantly on harnessing high frequency bands effectively. These bands predominantly operate in line-of-sight (LoS) paths, necessitating well-configured antenna arrays and beamforming techniques for optimal spectrum utilization. Maximizing the potential of LoS multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which are crucial for achieving high spectral efficiency, heavily depends on this. As the costs and power demands of mixed-signal devices in high frequency bands make a fully-digital architecture impractical for large-scale MIMO setups, our focus shifts to a hybrid analog-digital hardware configuration. Yet, analog processors' limitations restrict flexibility within arrays, necessitating a nuanced understanding of hardware constraints for optimal antenna configuration design. We explore array design that optimizes the spectral efficiency of hybrid systems, considering hardware constraints. We propose an optimal antenna configuration, leveraging the prolate matrix structure of the LoS channel between two planar arrays. Building on the optimal array configuration, we introduce a low-complexity explicit analog-digital beam focusing scheme that exploits the asymptotic behavior of the LoS channel matrix in the near-field region. Simulation results validate that the proposed antenna configuration and beam focusing scheme achieves near-optimal performance across a range of signal-to-noise ratios with low computational complexity, even under arbitrary rotations relative to the communication link.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Provably Convergent Computation of Information Bottleneck: A Semi-Relaxed Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information Bottleneck (IB) is a technique to extract information about one target random variable through another relevant random variable. This technique has garnered significant interest due to its broad applications in information theory and deep learning. Hence, there is a strong motivation to develop efficient numerical methods with high precision and theoretical convergence guarantees. In this paper, we propose a semi-relaxed IB model, where the Markov chain and transition probability condition are relaxed from the relevance-compression function. Based on the proposed model, we develop an algorithm, which recovers the relaxed constraints and involves only closed-form iterations. Specifically, the algorithm is obtained by analyzing the Lagrangian of the relaxed model with alternating minimization in each direction. The convergence property of the proposed algorithm is theoretically guaranteed through descent estimation and Pinsker's inequality. Numerical experiments across classical and discrete distributions corroborate the analysis. Moreover, our proposed algorithm demonstrates notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency, evidenced by significantly reduced run times compared to existing methods with comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards Atomic MIMO Receivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of Rydberg atoms in quantum sensing is driving a paradigm shift from classical receivers to atomic receivers. Capitalizing on the extreme sensitivity of Rydberg atoms to external disturbance, atomic receivers can measure radio-waves more precisely than classical receivers to support high-performance wireless communication and sensing. Although the atomic receiver is developing rapidly in quantum-sensing domain, its integration with wireless communications is still at a nascent stage. Particularly, systematic methods to enhance communication performance through this integration are largely uncharted. Motivated by this observation, we propose to incorporate atomic receivers into multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication to implement atomic-MIMO receivers. Specifically, we establish the framework of atomic-MIMO receivers exploiting the principle of quantum sensing, and reveal that its signal detection is intrinsically a non-linear biased phase-retrieval (PR) problem, as opposed to the linear model in classical MIMO systems. To this end, we modify the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, a typical PR solver, with a biased GS algorithm to solve the discovered biased PR problem. Moreover, we propose an Expectation-Maximization-GS (EM-GS) algorithm by introducing a high-pass filter constructed by Bessel functions into the iteration of GS, which improves the detection accuracy efficiently. Finally, the effectiveness of atomic MIMO receivers is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current world due to the huge demand for storage, DNA-based storage solution sounds quite promising because of their longevity, low power consumption, and high capacity. However in real life storing data in the form of DNA is quite expensive, and challenging. Therefore researchers and developers develop such kind of software that helps simulate real-life DNA storage without worrying about the cost. This paper aims to review some of the software that performs DNA storage simulations in different domains. The paper also explains the core concepts such as synthesis, sequencing, clustering, reconstruction, GC window, K-mer window, etc and some overview on existing algorithms. Further, we present 3 different softwares on the basis of domain, implementation techniques, and customer/commercial usability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has become a fundamental component of next-generation wireless communication systems. Theoretically, although MARL has the advantages of low computational complexity and fast convergence rate, there exist several challenges including partial observability, non-stationary, and scalability. In this article, we investigate a novel MARL with graph neural network-aided communication (GNNComm-MARL) to address the aforementioned challenges by making use of graph attention networks to effectively sample neighborhoods and selectively aggregate messages. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the architecture of GNNComm-MARL and present a systematic design solution. We then present the typical applications of GNNComm-MARL from two aspects: resource allocation and mobility management. The results obtained unveil that GNNComm-MARL can achieve better performance with lower communication overhead compared to conventional communication schemes. Finally, several important research directions regarding GNNComm-MARL are presented to facilitate further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to the application of metamaterials, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (H-MIMO) is expected to achieve a higher spatial diversity gain by enabling the ability to generate any current distribution on the surface. With the aid of electromagnetic (EM) manipulation capability of H-MIMO, integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) system can fully exploits the EM channel to realize energy focusing and eliminate inter-user interference, which yields the concept of holographic IDET (H-IDET). In this paper, we invetigate the beamforming designs for H-IDET systems, where the sum-rate of data users (DUs) are maximized by guaranteeing the energy harvesting requirements of energy users (EUs). In order to solve the non-convex functional programming, a block coordinate descent (BCD) based scheme is proposed, wherein the Fourier transform and the equivalence between the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the mean-square error (MSE) are also conceived, followed by the successive convex approximation (SCA) and an initialization scheme to enhance robustness. Numerical results illustrate that our proposed H-IDET scheme outperforms benchmark schemes, especially the one adopting traditional discrete antennas. Besides, the near-field focusing using EM channel model achieves better performance compared to that using the traditional channel model, especially for WPT where the EUs are usually close to the transmitter.</description>

      <title>On Linear Codes Whose Hermitian Hulls are MD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermitian hulls of linear codes are interesting for theoretical and practical reasons alike. In terms of recent application, linear codes whose hulls meet certain conditions have been utilized as ingredients to construct entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes. This family of quantum codes is often seen as a generalization of quantum stabilizer codes. Theoretically, compared with the Euclidean setup, the Hermitian case is much harder to deal with. Hermitian hulls of MDS linear codes with low dimensions have been explored, mostly from generalized Reed-Solomon codes. Characterizing Hermitian hulls which themselves are MDS appears to be more involved and has not been extensively studied.
  This paper introduces some tools to study linear codes whose Hermitian hulls are MDS. Using the tools, we then propose explicit constructions of such codes. We consider Hermitian hulls of both Reed-Solomon and non Reed-Solomon types of linear MDS codes. We demonstrate that, given the same Hermitian hull dimensions, the codes from our constructions have dimensions which are larger than those in the literature.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Wideband Near-Field Sensing (NISE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of large bandwidth on near-filed sensing (NISE) is analyzed in multi-carrier systems. The fundamental Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for wideband NISE are characterized. In particular, the closed-form CRBs are derived for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs). Then, the asymptotic CRBs are analyzed. It is rigorously proved that: 1) as the number of antennas N increases, the maximum decay rates of asymptotic CRBs are 1/N for ULAs and 1/N^2 for UCAs; 2) as the number of subcarriers M increases, the asymptotic CRBs decay as 1/M^3 for both ULAs and UCAs; and 3) CRBs are inversely proportional to the beamforming gain. Based on the analytical results, two practical beamforming approaches are proposed for near-field wideband integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), namely independent and joint approaches. For the independent approach, the beamformer on each subcarrier is designed exclusively for either sensing or communication. For the joint approach, the beamformer on each subcarrier is jointly optimized for both functions through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Finally, numerical results show that 1) large bandwidth sets an estimation error ceiling for NISE; 2) NISE performance converges to far-field sensing performance when the bandwidth is extremely large; 3) there is a tradeoff between array size and system bandwidth for achieving a given sensing performance; and 4) the simple independent beamforming approach achieves an ISAC performance close to the complex joint beamforming approach.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Examination of Least Squares Error in Low-bitwidth Cholesky Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to justify a round-off error impact on the accuracy of the linear least squares (LS) solution using Cholesky decomposition. This decomposition is widely employed to inverse a matrix in the linear detector of the Multi-User multi-antenna receiver. The proposed stochastic bound is much closer to actual errors than other numerical bounds. It was tested with a half-precision format and validated in realistic scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate our approach predicts errors very close to those achieved by simulations. The proposed approach can be employed to analyze the resulting round-off error in many other applications.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Manifold Approach to Constrained Resource Allocation in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new resource allocation framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, which are expected to be fundamental aspects of sixth-generation networks. In particular, we develop an augmented Lagrangian manifold optimization (ALMO) framework designed to maximize communication sum rate while satisfying sensing beampattern gain targets and base station (BS) transmit power limits. ALMO applies the principles of Riemannian manifold optimization (MO) to navigate the complex, non-convex landscape of the resource allocation problem. It efficiently leverages the augmented Lagrangian method to ensure adherence to constraints. We present comprehensive numerical results to validate our framework, which illustrates the ALMO method's superior capability to enhance the dual functionalities of communication and sensing in ISAC systems. For instance, with 12 antennas and 30 dBm BS transmit power, our proposed ALMO algorithm delivers a 10.1% sum rate gain over a benchmark optimization-based algorithm. This work demonstrates significant improvements in system performance and contributes a new algorithmic perspective to ISAC resource management.</description>

      <title>Spatially Correlated RIS-Aided Secure Massive MIMO Under CSI and Hardware Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a secure multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI), imperfect channel state information (CSI), and spatially correlated channels. We first introduce a linear minimum-mean-square error estimation algorithm for the aggregate channel by considering the impact of transceiver HWI and RIS phase-shift errors. Then, we derive a lower bound for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper when artificial noise (AN) is employed at the base station (BS). In addition, the obtained expressions of the ergodic secrecy rate are further simplified in some noteworthy special cases to obtain valuable insights. To counteract the effects of HWI, we present a power allocation optimization strategy between the confidential signals and AN, which admits a fixed-point equation solution. Our analysis reveals that a non-zero ergodic secrecy rate is preserved if the total transmit power decreases no faster than $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of RIS elements. Moreover, the ergodic secrecy rate grows logarithmically with the number of BS antennas $M$ and approaches a certain limit in the asymptotic regime $N\rightarrow\infty$. Simulation results are provided to verify the derived analytical results. They reveal the impact of key design parameters on the secrecy rate. It is shown that, with the proposed power allocation strategy, the secrecy rate loss due to HWI can be counteracted by increasing the number of low-cost RIS elements.</description>

      <title>T3DRIS: Advancing Conformal RIS Design through In-depth Analysis of Mutual Coupling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical and mathematical framework for the design of a conformal reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that adapts to non-planar geometries, which is a critical advancement for the deployment of RIS on non-planar and irregular surfaces as envisioned in smart radio environments. Previous research focused mainly on the optimization of RISs assuming a predetermined shape, while neglecting the intricate interplay between shape optimization, phase optimization, and mutual coupling effects. Our contribution, the T3DRIS framework, addresses this fundamental problem by integrating the configuration and shape optimization of RISs into a unified model and design framework, thus facilitating the application of RIS technology to a wider spectrum of environmental objects. The mathematical core of T3DRIS is rooted in optimizing the 3D deployment of the unit cells and tuning circuits, aiming at maximizing the communication performance. Through rigorous full-wave simulations and a comprehensive set of numerical analyses, we validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its superior performance and applicability over contemporary designs. This study-the first of its kind-paves the way for a new direction in RIS research, emphasizing the importance of a theoretical and mathematical perspective in tackling the challenges of conformal RISs.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal MMSE Channel Estimation for One-Bit Quantized MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit quantization at the receiver side. Despite its optimality and significance in estimation theory, the MMSE channel estimator has not been fully investigated in this context due to its general non-linearity and computational complexity. Instead, the typically suboptimal Bussgang linear MMSE (BLMMSE) estimator has been widely adopted. In this work, we develop a new framework to compute the MMSE channel estimator that hinges on computation of the orthant probability of the multivariate normal distribution. Based on this framework, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the BLMMSE channel estimator to be optimal and equivalent to the MMSE estimator. Under the assumption of specific channel correlation or pilot symbols, we further utilize the framework to derive analytical expressions for the MMSE channel estimator that are particularly convenient for computation when certain system dimensions become large, thereby enabling a comparison between the BLMMSE and MMSE channel estimators in these cases.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Multi-User MIMO Equalization via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large pre-trained sequence models, such as transformers, excel as few-shot learners capable of in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, a model is trained to adapt its operation to a new task based on limited contextual information, typically in the form of a few training examples for the given task. Previous work has explored the use of ICL for channel equalization in single-user multi-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this work, we demonstrate that ICL can be also used to tackle the problem of multi-user equalization in cell-free MIMO systems with limited fronthaul capacity. In this scenario, a task is defined by channel statistics, signal-to-noise ratio, and modulation schemes. The context encompasses the users' pilot sequences, the corresponding quantized received signals, and the current received data signal. Different prompt design strategies are proposed and evaluated that encompass also large-scale fading and modulation information. Experiments demonstrate that ICL-based equalization provides estimates with lower mean squared error as compared to the linear minimum mean squared error equalizer, especially in the presence of limited fronthaul capacity and pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics. So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication). In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our narrative starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our metaphor is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been suggested to be a key 6G feature and was suggested to be considered as a study-item in both 3GPP Releases 18 and 19. However, in both releases, it has been decided not to continue with it as a study-item, and to leave it for possible future specification. In this paper, we present the rationale for such a decision. Particularly, we demonstrate the practical issues which may affect the feasibility or usefulness of RIS in cellular networks, and present open problems to be addressed before RIS can be used in practice. Moreover, we compare the performance of RIS with network-controlled repeater, the node with the most similar characteristics to RIS and which has been standardized in 3GPP Release 18. Finally, different simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of RIS-assisted networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gradient Estimation of Variational Quantum Circuits with Lie Algebraic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization and learning strategies are among the most promising approaches to harnessing quantum information or gaining a quantum advantage over classical methods. However, efficient estimation of the gradient of the objective function in such models remains a challenge due to several factors including the exponential dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces, and information loss of quantum measurements. In this work, we study generic parameterized circuits in the context of variational methods. We develop a framework for gradient estimation that exploits the algebraic symmetries of Hamiltonian characterized through Lie algebra or group theory. Particularly, we prove that when the dimension of the dynamical Lie algebra is polynomial in the number of qubits, one can estimate the gradient with polynomial classical and quantum resources. This is done by a series of Hadamard tests applied to the output of the ansatz with no change to its circuit. We show that this approach can be equipped with classical shadow tomography to further reduce the measurement shot complexity to scale logarithmically with the number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformer for Wireless Communications: A New Paradigm of Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the next generation of mobile systems evolves, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to deeply integrate with wireless communications for resource management in variable environments. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an important tool for addressing stochastic optimization issues of resource allocation. However, DRL has to start each new training process from the beginning once the state and action spaces change, causing low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability. Moreover, each DRL training process may take a large number of epochs to converge, which is unacceptable for time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we adopt an alternative AI technology, namely, the Decision Transformer (DT), and propose a DT-based adaptive decision architecture for wireless resource management. This architecture innovates through constructing pre-trained models in the cloud and then fine-tuning personalized models at the edges. By leveraging the power of DT models learned over extensive datasets, the proposed architecture is expected to achieve rapid convergence with many fewer training epochs and higher performance in a new context, e.g., similar tasks with different state and action spaces, compared with DRL. We then design DT frameworks for two typical communication scenarios: Intelligent reflecting surfaces-aided communications and unmanned aerial vehicle-aided edge computing. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DT frameworks achieve over $3$-$6$ times speedup in convergence and better performance relative to the classic DRL method, namely, proximal policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Association schemes arising from non-weakly regular bent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Association schemes play an important role in algebraic combinatorics and have important applications in coding theory, graph theory and design theory. The methods to construct association schemes by using bent functions have been extensively studied. Recently, in [13], {\"O}zbudak and Pelen constructed infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $5$ and $6$ by using ternary non-weakly regular bent functions.They also stated that constructing $2p$-class association schemes from $p$-ary non-weakly regular bent functions is an interesting problem, where $p&gt;3$ is an odd prime. In this paper, using non-weakly regular bent functions, we construct infinite families of symmetric association schemes of classes $2p$, $(2p+1)$ and $\frac{3p+1}{2}$ for any odd prime $p$. Fusing those association schemes, we also obtain $t$-class symmetric association schemes, where $t=4,5,6,7$. In addition, we give the sufficient and necessary conditions for the partitions $P$, $D$, $T$, $U$ and $V$ (defined in this paper) to induce symmetric association schemes.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Multi-Server Jobs is Not Easy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of online scheduling of multi-server jobs is considered, where there are a total of $K$ servers, and each job requires concurrent service from multiple servers for it to be processed. Each job on its arrival reveals its processing time, the number of servers from which it needs concurrent service and an online algorithm has to make scheduling decisions using only causal information, with the goal of minimizing the response/flow time. The worst case input model is considered and the performance metric is the competitive ratio. For the case, when all job processing time (sizes) are the same, we show that the competitive ratio of any deterministic/randomized algorithm is at least $\Omega(K)$ and propose an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is at most $K+1$. With equal job sizes, we also consider the resource augmentation regime where an online algorithm has access to more servers than an optimal offline algorithm. With resource augmentation, we propose a simple algorithm and show that it has a competitive ratio of $1$ when provided with $2K$ servers with respect to an optimal offline algorithm with $K$ servers. With unequal job sizes, we propose an online algorithm whose competitive ratio is at most $2K \log (K w_{\max})$, where $w_{\max}$ is the maximum size of any job.</description>

      <title>Jammer-Resilient Time Synchronization in the MIMO Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a promising approach to jammer mitigation. Effective MIMO data detectors that mitigate smart jammers have recently been proposed, but they all assume perfect time synchronization between transmitter(s) and receiver. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no methods for resilient time synchronization in the presence of smart jammers. To remedy this situation, we propose JASS, the first method that enables reliable time synchronization for the single-user MIMO uplink while mitigating smart jamming attacks. JASS detects a randomized synchronization sequence based on a novel optimization problem that fits a spatial filter to the time-windowed receive signal in order to mitigate the jammer. We underscore the efficacy of the proposed optimization problem by proving that it ensures successful time synchronization under certain intuitive conditions. We then derive an efficient algorithm for approximately solving our optimization problem. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of JASS against a wide range of different jammer types.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection for Multiple Data Streams Using the James-Stein Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of quickest change detection is studied in the context of detecting an arbitrary unknown mean-shift in multiple independent Gaussian data streams. The James-Stein estimator is used in constructing detection schemes that exhibit strong detection performance both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. First, a James-Stein-based extension of the recently developed windowed CuSum test is introduced. Our results indicate that the proposed scheme constitutes a uniform improvement over its typical maximum likelihood variant. That is, the proposed James-Stein version achieves a smaller detection delay simultaneously for all possible post-change parameter values and every false alarm rate constraint, as long as the number of parallel data streams is greater than three. Additionally, an alternative detection procedure that utilizes the James-Stein estimator is shown to have asymptotic detection delay properties that compare favorably to existing tests. The second-order term of the asymptotic average detection delay is reduced in a predefined low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space, while second-order asymptotic minimaxity is preserved. The results are verified in simulations, where the proposed schemes are shown to achieve smaller detection delays compared to existing alternatives, especially when the number of data streams is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02480v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, phase retrieval has received much attention in statistics, applied mathematics and optical engineering. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, termed Subspace Phase Retrieval (SPR), which can accurately recover an $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse complex-valued signal $\x$ given its $\Omega(k^2\log n)$ magnitude-only Gaussian samples if the minimum nonzero entry of $\x$ satisfies $|x_{\min}| = \Omega(\|\x\|/\sqrt{k})$. Furthermore, if the energy sum of the most significant $\sqrt{k}$ elements in $\x$ is comparable to $\|\x\|^2$, the SPR algorithm can exactly recover $\x$ with $\Omega(k \log n)$ magnitude-only samples, which attains the information-theoretic sampling complexity for sparse phase retrieval. Numerical Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance compared to existing ones.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Wireless Communication Systems: Joint Location and Passive Beamforming Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely studied in recent years, it has emerged as a new technology which can reflect the incident signal by intelligently configuring the reflection elements, thus changing the signal propagation environment, enhancing the signals users desire and suppressing the interference between users. In this paper, we study an IRS aided multi-users wireless communication where the base station (BS) sends a variety of signals, each user receives desired signals. In order to guarantee the fairness of wireless communications, we need to maximize the minimum rates of users, subject to the power constraint of BS and the phase constraint of IRS. Prior works on IRS mainly consider optimizing BS beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, this paper also aims to optimize the IRS location. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, transforming the two subproblems into a lower bound problem and using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve them, respectively. Finally, the two subproblems are optimized alternately to make the objective function value converge in an acceptable range. Simulation results verify the convergence results of our proposed algorithm, and the performance improvement compared with the benchmark scheme in wireless communication system.</description>

      <title>QoE-based Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Task Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By transmitting task-related information only, semantic communications yield significant performance gains over conventional communications. However, the lack of mature semantic theory about semantic information quantification and performance evaluation makes it challenging to perform resource allocation for semantic communications, especially when multiple tasks coexist in the network. To cope with this challenge, we propose a quality-of-experience (QoE) based semantic-aware resource allocation method for multi-task networks in this paper. First, semantic entropy is defined to quantify the semantic information for different tasks, and the relationship between semantic entropy and Shannon entropy is analyzed. Then, we develop a novel QoE model to formulate the semantic-aware resource allocation in terms of semantic compression, channel assignment, and transmit power. The compatibility of the formulated problem with conventional communications is further demonstrated. To solve this problem, we decouple it into two subproblems and solved them by a developed deep Q-network (DQN) based method and a proposed low-complexity matching algorithm, respectively. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, as well as its compatibility with conventional communications.</description>

      <title>On the Direct Construction of MDS and Near-MDS Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal branch number of MDS matrices makes them a preferred choice for designing diffusion layers in many block ciphers and hash functions. Consequently, various methods have been proposed for designing MDS matrices, including search and direct methods. While exhaustive search is suitable for small order MDS matrices, direct constructions are preferred for larger orders due to the vast search space involved. In the literature, there has been extensive research on the direct construction of MDS matrices using both recursive and nonrecursive methods. On the other hand, in lightweight cryptography, Near-MDS (NMDS) matrices with sub-optimal branch numbers offer a better balance between security and efficiency as a diffusion layer compared to MDS matrices. However, no direct construction method is available in the literature for constructing recursive NMDS matrices. This paper introduces some direct constructions of NMDS matrices in both nonrecursive and recursive settings. Additionally, it presents some direct constructions of nonrecursive MDS matrices from the generalized Vandermonde matrices. We propose a method for constructing involutory MDS and NMDS matrices using generalized Vandermonde matrices. Furthermore, we prove some folklore results that are used in the literature related to the NMDS code.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Latency-Rate Tradeoff in Low-Latency Communications with Finite-Blocklength Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency communication plays an increasingly important role in delay-sensitive applications by ensuring the real-time exchange of information. However, due to the constraints on the maximum instantaneous power, bounded latency is hard to be guaranteed. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communications with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). More specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain respectively, we further adopt the asymptotic analysis approach to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communications with FBC, an EC-approximation method is further conceived to derive the closed-form expression of quality-of-service-constrained throughput. Our results may provide some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are adopted.</description>

      <title>On the Low-SNR Asymptotic Capacity of Two Types of Optical Wireless Channels under Average-Intensity Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two types of optical wireless channels under average-intensity constraints. One is called the Gaussian optical intensity channel, where the channel output models the converted electrical current corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise. The other one is the Poisson optical intensity channel, where the channel output models the number of received photons corrupted by the positive dark current. When the average input intensity $\mathcal{E}$ is small, the capacity of the Gaussian optical intensity channel is shown to scale as $\mathcal{E}\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}}{2}}$, and the capacity of the Poisson optical intensity channel as $\mathcal{E}\log\log\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}$, which close the existing capacity gaps in these two channels.</description>

Abstract: Sum-rank codes have known applications in the multishot network coding, the distributed storage and the construction of space-time codes. U. Mart\'{\i}nez-Pe\~{n}as introduced the cyclic-skew-cyclic sum-rank codes and proposed the BCH bound on the cyclic-skew-cyclic sum-rank codes in his paper published in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 67, no. 8, 2021. Afterwards, many sum-rank BCH codes with lower bounds on their dimensions and minimum sum-rank distances were constructed. Sum-rank Hartmann-Tzeng bound and sum-rank Roos bound on cyclic-skew-cyclic codes were proposed and proved by G. N. Alfarano, F. J. Lobillo, A. Neri, and A. Wachter-Zeh in 2022. In this paper, cyclic, negacyclic and constacyclic sum-rank codes are introduced and a direct construction of cyclic, negacyclic and constacyclic sum-rank codes of the matrix size $m \times m$ from cyclic, negacyclic and constacyclic codes over ${\bf F}_{q^m}$ in the Hamming metric is proposed. The cyclic-skew-cylic sum-rank codes are special cyclic sum-rank codes. In addition, BCH and Hartmann-Tzeng bounds for a type of cyclic sum-rank codes are developed. Specific constructions of cyclic, negacyclic and constacyclic sum-rank codes with known dimensions and controllable minimum sum-rank distances are proposed. Moreover, many distance-optimal binary sum-rank codes and an infinite family of distance-optimal binary cyclic sum-rank codes with minimum sum-rank distance four are constructed. This is the first infinite family of distance-optimal sum-rank codes with minimum sum-rank distance four in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sources Information Fusion Learning for Multi-Points NLOS Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate localization of mobile terminals is a pivotal aspect of integrated sensing and communication systems. Traditional fingerprint localization methods, which infer coordinates from channel information within pre-defined rectangular areas, often face challenges due to the heterogeneous distribution of fingerprints inherent in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a novel multi-source information fusion learning framework referred to as the Autosync Multi-Domain NLOS Localization (AMDNLoc). Specifically, AMDNLoc employs a two-stage matched filter fused with a target tracking algorithm and iterative centroid-based clustering to automatically and irregularly segment NLOS regions, ensuring uniform fingerprint distribution within channel state information across frequency, power, and time-delay domains. Additionally, the framework utilizes a segment-specific linear classifier array, coupled with deep residual network-based feature extraction and fusion, to establish the correlation function between fingerprint features and coordinates within these regions. Simulation results demonstrate that AMDNLoc achieves an impressive accuracy of 1.46 meters on typical wireless artificial intelligence research datasets and offers interpretability, adaptability, and scalability in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficient List-decoding of Polynomial Ideal Codes with Optimal List Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough [BGM23, GZ23, AGL23], it was shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes are list decodable with optimal list size with high probability, i.e., they attain the Singleton bound for list decoding [ST20, Rot22, GST22]. We extend this result to the family of polynomial ideal codes, a large class of error-correcting codes which includes several well-studied families of codes such as Reed-Solomon, folded Reed-Solomon, and multiplicity codes. More specifically, similarly to the Reed-Solomon setting, we show that randomly punctured polynomial ideal codes over an exponentially large alphabet exactly achieve the Singleton bound for list-decoding; while such codes over a polynomially large alphabet approximately achieve it.
  Combining our results with the efficient list-decoding algorithm for a large subclass of polynomial ideal codes of [BHKS21], implies as a corollary that a large subclass of polynomial ideal codes (over random evaluation points) is efficiently list decodable with optimal list size. To the best of our knowledge, this gives the first family of codes that can be efficiently list decoded with optimal list size (for all list sizes), as well as the first family of linear codes of rate $R$ that can be efficiently list decoded up to a radius of $1 -R-\epsilon$ with list size that is polynomial (and even linear) in $1/\epsilon$. Our result applies to natural families of codes with algebraic structure such as folded Reed-Solomon or multiplicity codes (over random evaluation points).
  Our proof follows the general framework of [BGM23, GZ23, AGL23], but several new ingredients are needed. The main two new ingredients are a polynomial-ideal GM-MDS theorem (extending the algebraic GM-MDS theorem of [YH19, Lov21]), as well as a duality theorem for polynomial ideal codes, both of which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new continuous phase frequency shift keying that is particularly suited for multi-antenna communications when the link budget is critical and beam alignment is problematic. It combines the constant envelope of frequency modulation with low-rate repetition coding in order to compensate for the absence of transmit beamforming. Although it is a frequency modulation, its transmit signal shows close to rectangular spectral shape. Similar to GSM's Gaussian minimum shift keying, it can be well approximated by linear modulation, when combined with differential precoding. This allows for easy coherent demodulation by means of a windowed fast Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation Considerate Precoder Design for Multi-user Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems: The Concept and Fast Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) communication networks target peak data rates exceeding 1Tbps, necessitating base stations (BS) to support up to 100 simultaneous data streams. However, sparse pilot allocation to accommodate such streams poses challenges for users' channel estimation. This paper presents Channel Estimation Considerate Precoding (CECP), where BS precoders prioritize facilitating channel estimation alongside maximizing transmission rate. To address the computational complexity of 6G large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, we propose a computationally-efficient space-time block diagonal channel shortening (ST-BDCS) precoding scheme. By leveraging the sparse Toeplitz property of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, this time-domain precoding design effectively mitigates multi-user interference in the downlink and shortens the effective channel's temporal length. Consequently, users can estimate the channels using sparse pilots. To enable fast implementation, we develop a generalized complex-valued Toeplitz matrix QR decomposition algorithm applicable to various space-time signal processing problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the ST-BDCS precoding method approximates the rate performance of conventional subcarrier-by-subcarrier precoding schemes. However, it offers the advantages of easier channel estimation for users and significantly reduced computational complexity for the BS.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications for mmWave Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.00552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system operating at the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. Specifically, the ISAC system combines communication and radar operations and performs, detecting and communicating simultaneously with multiple targets and users. The IRS dynamically controls the amplitude or phase of the radio signal via reflecting elements to reconfigure the radio propagation environment and enhance the transmission rate of the ISAC system. By jointly designing the radar signal covariance (RSC) matrix, the beamforming vector of the communication system, and the IRS phase shift, the ISAC system transmission rate can be improved while matching the desired waveform for radar. The problem is non-convex due to multivariate coupling, and thus we decompose it into two separate subproblems. First, a closed-form solution of the RSC matrix is derived from the desired radar waveform. Next, the quadratic transformation (QT) technique is applied to the subproblem, and then alternating optimization (AO) is employed to determine the communication beamforming vector and the IRS phase shift. For computing the IRS phase shift, we adopt both the majorization minimization (MM) and the manifold optimization (MO). Also, we derive a closed-form solution for the formulated problem, effectively decreasing computational complexity. Furthermore, a trade-off factor is introduced to balance the performance of communication and sensing. Finally, the simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrate that the IRS can improve the performance of the ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Empirical Risk Minimization with Relative Entropy Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06617v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem with relative entropy regularization (ERM-RER) is investigated under the assumption that the reference measure is a $\sigma$-finite measure, and not necessarily a probability measure. Under this assumption, which leads to a generalization of the ERM-RER problem allowing a larger degree of flexibility for incorporating prior knowledge, numerous relevant properties are stated. Among these properties, the solution to this problem, if it exists, is shown to be a unique probability measure, mutually absolutely continuous with the reference measure. Such a solution exhibits a probably-approximately-correct guarantee for the ERM problem independently of whether the latter possesses a solution. For a fixed dataset and under a specific condition, the empirical risk is shown to be a sub-Gaussian random variable when the models are sampled from the solution to the ERM-RER problem. The generalization capabilities of the solution to the ERM-RER problem (the Gibbs algorithm) are studied via the sensitivity of the expected empirical risk to deviations from such a solution towards alternative probability measures. Finally, an interesting connection between sensitivity, generalization error, and lautum information is established.</description>

      <title>Rationality of Four-Valued Families of Weil Sums of Binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the rationality of Weil sums of binomials of the form $W^{K,s}_u=\sum_{x \in K} \psi(x^s - u x)$, where $K$ is a finite field whose canonical additive character is $\psi$, and where $u$ is an element of $K^{\times}$ and $s$ is a positive integer relatively prime to $|K^\times|$, so that $x \mapsto x^s$ is a permutation of $K$. The Weil spectrum for $K$ and $s$, which is the family of values $W^{K,s}_u$ as $u$ runs through $K^\times$, is of interest in arithmetic geometry and in several information-theoretic applications. The Weil spectrum always contains at least three distinct values if $s$ is nondegenerate (i.e., if $s$ is not a power of $p$ modulo $|K^\times|$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $K$). It is already known that if the Weil spectrum contains precisely three distinct values, then they must all be rational integers. We show that if the Weil spectrum contains precisely four distinct values, then they must all be rational integers, with the sole exception of the case where $|K|=5$ and $s \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.</description>

      <title>Bridging Algorithmic Information Theory and Machine Learning: A New Approach to Kernel Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) look at Complexity from different points of view. We explore the interface between AIT and Kernel Methods (that are prevalent in ML) by adopting an AIT perspective on the problem of learning kernels from data, in kernel ridge regression, through the method of Sparse Kernel Flows. In particular, by looking at the differences and commonalities between Minimal Description Length (MDL) and Regularization in Machine Learning (RML), we prove that the method of Sparse Kernel Flows is the natural approach to adopt to learn kernels from data. This approach aligns naturally with the MDL principle, offering a more robust theoretical basis than the existing reliance on cross-validation. The study reveals that deriving Sparse Kernel Flows does not require a statistical approach; instead, one can directly engage with code-lengths and complexities, concepts central to AIT. Thereby, this approach opens the door to reformulating algorithms in machine learning using tools from AIT, with the aim of providing them a more solid theoretical foundation.</description>

      <title>IEEE 802.11be Network Throughput Optimization with Multi-Link Operation and AP Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) introduces a new concept called multi-link operation (MLO), which allows multiple Wi-Fi interfaces in different bands (2.4, 5, and 6 GHz) to work together to increase network throughput, reduce latency, and improve spectrum reuse efficiency in dense overlapping networks. To make the most of MLO, this paper proposes a new data-driven resource allocation algorithm for the 11be network with the aid of an access point (AP) controller. To maximize network throughput, a network topology optimization problem is formulated for 11be network, which is solved by exploiting the totally unimodular property of the bipartite graph formed by the connection between AP and station (STA) in Wi-Fi networks. Subsequently, a proportional fairness algorithm is applied for radio link allocation, network throughput optimization considering the channel condition, and the fairness of the multi-link device (MLD) data rate. The performance of the proposed algorithm on two main MLO implementations - multi-link multi-radio (MLMR) with simultaneous transmission and reception (STR), and the interplay between multiple nodes employing them are evaluated through cross-layer (PHY-MAC) data rate simulation with PHY abstraction.</description>
