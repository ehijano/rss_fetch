      <title>An Investigation of Physics Informed Neural Networks to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann Equation in Molecular Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is a machine learning (ML)-based method to solve partial differential equations that has gained great popularity due to the fast development of ML libraries in the last few years. The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is widely used to model mean-field electrostatics in molecular systems, and in this work we present a detailed investigation of the use of PINN to solve the PBE. Starting from a multidomain PINN for the PBE with an interface, we assess the importance of incorporating different features into the neural network architecture. Our findings indicate that the most accurate architecture utilizes input and output scaling layers, a random Fourier features layer, trainable activation functions, and a loss balancing algorithm. The accuracy of our implementation is of the order of 10$^{-2}$ -- $10^{-3}$, which is similar to previous work using PINN to solve other differential equations. We also explore the possibility of incorporating experimental information into the model, and discuss challenges and future work, especially regarding the nonlinear PBE. Along with this manuscript, we are providing an open-source implementation to easily perform computations from a PDB file. We hope this work will motivate application scientists into using PINN to study molecular electrostatics, as ML technology continues to evolve at a high pace.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Basis Set Amelioration Method for Incremental Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental full configuration interaction (iFCI) is polynomial-cost approach to the FCI limit of electronic structure. This article introduces the many-body basis set amelioration (MBBSA) method, which is designed to allow iFCI to be applicable to larger atomic orbital basis sets. MBBSA uses a series of inexpensive iFCI calculations to approximate the correlation energy that would be found using a more expensive, highly accurate iFCI calculation. When compared to standard iFCI computations on smaller molecules in triple-zeta and larger basis sets, MBBSA provides approximations to total and relative energies within chemical accuracy. MBBSA yields cost savings of between 60 and 92% when compared to standard iFCI calculations, with larger systems having increased savings. Tests of MBBSA on two reactions that involve highly correlated systems, the automerization of cyclobutadiene and a Criegee intermediate reaction, show that MBBSA has practical utility for studying realistic chemistries.</description>

      <title>Path integral Monte Carlo in a discrete variable representation with Gibbs sampling: dipolar planar rotor chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach based on discretized continuous degrees of freedom and rejection-free Gibbs sampling. The ground state properties of a chain of planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions are used to illustrate the approach. Energetic and structural properties are computed and compared to exact diagonalization and Numerical Matrix Multiplication for $N \leq 3$ to assess the systematic Trotter factorization error convergence. For larger chains with up to N = 100 rotors, Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations are used as a benchmark. We show that using Gibbs sampling is advantageous compared to traditional Metroplolis-Hastings rejection importance sampling. Indeed, Gibbs sampling leads to lower variance and correlation in the computed observables.</description>

      <title>Enhancing universal machine learning potentials with polarizable long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are crucial in determining the behavior of chemical systems in various environments. Accurate predictions of physical and chemical phenomena at the atomic level hinge on accurate modeling of these interactions. Here, we present a framework that substantially enhances the predictive power of machine learning interatomic potentials by incorporating explicit polarizable long-range interactions with an equivariant graph neural network short-range potential. The pretrained universal model, applicable across the entire periodic table, can achieve first-principles accuracy. This versatile model has been further applied to diverse areas of research, including the study of mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectricity, and interfacial reactions, demonstrating its broad applicability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Atomic Interactions in Molecules as Learned by Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models have been able to achieve unprecedented accuracies across various prediction tasks in quantum chemistry, it is now apparent that accuracy on a test set alone is not a guarantee for robust chemical modeling such as stable molecular dynamics (MD). To go beyond accuracy, we use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to develop a general analysis framework for atomic interactions and apply it to the SchNet and PaiNN neural network models. We compare these interactions with a set of fundamental chemical principles to understand how well the models have learned the underlying physicochemical concepts from the data. We focus on the strength of the interactions for different atomic species, how predictions for intensive and extensive quantum molecular properties are made, and analyze the decay and many-body nature of the interactions with interatomic distance. Models that deviate too far from known physical principles produce unstable MD trajectories, even when they have very high energy and force prediction accuracy. We also suggest further improvements to the ML architectures to better account for the polynomial decay of atomic interactions.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Coupling Model of Optical Conductivity in Mixed-Valence Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Linear Response Theory, with appropriate wave functions and energies from perturbation method, the absorption profiles can be calculated for all three classes of mixed-valence systems as defined by Robin and Day : Class III (delocalized), Class I (localized) and Class II (intermediate between III and I). Based on these absorption profiles, one can calculate the corresponding frequency-dependent optical conductivity profiles with the following results: For all three classes, the optical conductivity profiles are similar to their corresponding absorption profiles in regard to band shape and polarization, except peaks of these profiles tend to shift toward higher frequency with respect to the absorption profiles. The charge transfer absorption (CT band) is the major contributors of optical conductivity. Moreover, the CT-induced IR band, also contributes to optical conductivity, as it borrows its intensity from the CT band and the amount of borrowing depends on its proximity to the latter, as in Class II.</description>

      <title>Coherent Phonons, Localization and Slow Polaron Formation in Lead-free Gold Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-free metal halide perovskites are emerging as less-toxic alternatives to their lead-based counterparts. However, their applicability in optoelectronic devices is limited, and the charge transport dynamics remain poorly understood. Understanding photo-induced charge and structural dynamics is critical for unlocking the potential of these novel systems. In this work, we employ ultrafast optical and Raman spectroscopy combined with band structure calculations to investigate the coupled electronic and vibrational dynamics in Caesium gold bromide, a promising lead-free perovskite. We find that the band-edge charge transfer states are strongly coupled to Au-Br stretching phonon modes, leading to frequency modulation of absorption by impulsively excited coherent phonons. Early-stage relaxation is characterized by dynamics of delocalized charge transfer excitation and slowly decaying coherent phonons. The electronic and vibrational relaxation reveals a slow formation of a localized polaronic state in the 10-20 ps timescale. Using a displaced harmonic oscillator model, the polaronic binding energy is estimated to be ~80 meV following lattice relaxation along the phonon modes. Strong exciton-phonon coupling and slow polaron formation via coupling to lattice modes make this material a promising testbed for the control of coherent phonons and localized polaronic states using light.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Generalized convolutional many body distribution functional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models of chemical and materials systems with billions of parameters require vast training datasets and considerable computational efforts. Lightweight kernel or decision tree based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized convolutional many-body distribution functionals (cMBDF) as highly compute and data efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atom centered Gaussian electron density proxy distributions weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on pre-defined grids. In the generalized form each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo-lumo gaps, heat-capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9 and VQM24 data sets. Due to its compactness, model training and testing times are reduced from 23 hours to 8 minutes, implying a corresponding reduction in carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Data Efficiency in $\Delta$-ML and Multifidelity Models for Quantum Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) methods has made quantum chemistry (QC) calculations more accessible by reducing the compute cost incurred in conventional QC methods. This has since been translated into the overhead cost of generating training data. Increased work in reducing the cost of generating training data resulted in the development of $\Delta$-ML and multifidelity machine learning methods which use data at more than one QC level of accuracy, or fidelity. This work compares the data costs associated with $\Delta$-ML, multifidelity machine learning (MFML), and optimized MFML (o-MFML) in contrast with a newly introduced Multifidelity$\Delta$-Machine Learning (MF$\Delta$ML) method for the prediction of ground state energies over the multifidelity benchmark dataset QeMFi. This assessment is made on the basis of training data generation cost associated with each model and is compared with the single fidelity kernel ridge regression (KRR) case. The results indicate that the use of multifidelity methods surpasses the standard $\Delta$-ML approaches in cases of a large number of predictions. For cases, where $\Delta$-ML method might be favored, such as small test set regimes, the MF$\Delta$-ML method is shown to be more efficient than conventional $\Delta$-ML.</description>

      <title>Generative Model for Constructing Reaction Path from Initial to Final States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping the chemical reaction pathways and their corresponding activation barriers is a significant challenge in molecular simulation. Given the inherent complexities of 3D atomic geometries, even generating an initial guess of these paths can be difficult for humans. This paper presents an innovative approach that utilizes neural networks to generate initial guesses for reaction pathways based on the initial state and learning from a database of low-energy transition paths. The proposed method is initiated by inputting the coordinates of the initial state, followed by progressive alterations to its structure. This iterative process culminates in the generation of the guess reaction path and the coordinates of the final state. The method does not require one-the-fly computation of the actual potential energy surface, and is therefore fast-acting. The application of this geometry-based method extends to complex reaction pathways illustrated by organic reactions. Training was executed on the Transition1x dataset of organic reaction pathways. The results revealed the generation of reactions that bore substantial similarities with the test set of chemical reaction paths. The method's flexibility allows for reactions to be generated either to conform to predetermined conditions or in a randomized manner.</description>
