      <title>Vanadium Doped Magnetic MoS2 Monolayers of Improved Electrical Conductivity as Spin-Orbit Torque Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal di-chalcogenide layers with high electrical conductivity and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can find huge potential in spintronic devices. With limited success of 2D spin Hall material development, we demonstrate vanadium (V) substitutionally doped monolayer MoS2 (VMS) as a potential spin Hall material having tunable electrical conductivity, SOC strength, and room temperature magnetism. Systematic enhancement in the electrical conductivity is observed with the extent of V doping, where it is enhanced from ~0.3 S/m of MoS2 to ~100000 S/m upon doping to the level of 9 atomic%. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) based spin-pumping experiments indicate the spin transport across the junction of permalloy (Py) and VMS. Spin-torque FMR measurements demonstrate the suggesting latter's potential as a spin-orbit torque layer in 2D spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Design and Process Analysis of a Split-Gate Trench Power MOSFET with Bottom-Trench Hk-Pillar Superjunction for Enhanced Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simulation-based novel Split-Gate Trench MOSFET structure with an optimized fabrication process to enhance power efficiency, switching speed, and thermal stability for high-performance semiconductor applications. Integrating high-k pillars with superjunction structures beneath the split gate enhancing breakdown performance by reducing critical field intensity by up to 35%, the device achieves a 15% improvement in Figures of Merit (FOMs) for BV2/Ron,sp. Dynamic testing reveals approximately a 25% reduction in both input and output capacitance, as well as gate-to-drain charge (QGD). This reduction, coupled with an approximately 40% improvement in Baliga's High-Frequency Figure of Merit (BHFFOM) and over 20% increase in the New High-Frequency Figure of Merit (NHFFOM), underscores the design's suitability for high-speed, high-efficiency power electronics. Simulations examining the effects of high-k pillar depth indicate that an optimal depth of 3.5 um achieves a balanced performance between BV and Ron,sp. The influence of high-k materials on BT-Hk-SJ MOSFET performance was investigated by comparing hafnium dioxide (HfO2), nitride, and oxynitride. Among these, HfO2 demonstrated optimal performance across static, dynamic, and diode characteristics due to its high dielectric constant, while material choice had minimal impact, with variations kept within 5%.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive Short-Wave Infrared Single-Photon Detection using a Silicon Single-Electron Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-sensitive short-wave infrared (SWIR) photon detection is a crucial aspect of ongoing research in quantum technology. However, developing such detectors on a CMOS-compatible silicon technological platform has been challenging due to the low absorption coefficient for silicon in the SWIR range. In this study, a codoped silicon-based single-electron transistor (SET) in a silicon-on-insulator field-effect transistor (SOI-FET) configuration is fabricated, which successfully detects single photons in the SWIR range with ultra-high sensitivity. The detection mechanism is evidenced by the shift in the onset of the SET current peaks and by the occurrence of random telegraph signals (RTS) under light irradiation, as compared to the dark condition. The calculated sensitivity of our device, in terms of noise equivalent power, is approximately 10-19 W Hz-1/2.</description>

      <title>Mathematical theory on multi-layer high contrast acoustic subwavelength resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength resonance is a vital acoustic phenomenon in contrasting media. The narrow bandgap width of single-layer resonator has prompted the exploration of multi-layer metamaterials as an effective alternative, which consist of alternating nests of high-contrast materials, called ``resonators'', and a background media. In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for studying acoustics within multi-layer high-contrast structures. Firstly, by using layer potential techniques, we establish the representation formula in terms of a matrix type operator with a block tridiagonal form for multi-layer structures within general geometry. Then we prove the existence of subwavelength resonances via Gohberg-Sigal theory, which generalizes the celebrated Minnaert resonances in single-layer structures. Intriguingly, we find that the primary contribution to mode splitting lies in the fact that as the number of nested resonators increases, the degree of the corresponding characteristic polynomial also increases, while the type of resonance (consists solely of monopolar resonances) remains unchanged. Furthermore, we derive original formulas for the subwavelength resonance frequencies of concentric dual-resonator. Numerical results associated with different nested resonators are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in molecular metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The absorption and emission spectrum arising from the vibrational motion of a molecule is mostly in the infrared region. These fingerprint absorptions of polar bonds enable us to acquire bond-specific chemical information from specimens. However, the mode mismatch between the atomic-scale dimensions of the chemical bonds and the resonance wavelength limits the direct detection of tiny amounts of samples such as self-assembled monolayers or biological membranes. To overcome this limitation, surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) has been proposed to enhance infrared absorption directly via local field enhancement. Here, we report on the perfect absorption of molecular vibration enabled by critical coupling in the metamaterials. Our molecular metamaterial design consists of a thin polymer layer sandwiched between a structured metal layer on top and a continuous metal layer at the bottom that supports the gap plasmon mode. The measured and simulated infrared spectra of the molecular metamaterial show broad and narrow absorption bands corresponding to the metamaterial and molecular vibration modes. We show that by tuning the structure's molecular film thickness and periodicity, vibrational absorption can be enhanced to near unity. We also show that for a particular periodicity of the array, metamaterial resonance can be completely suppressed, and only molecular vibrational absorption is excited, giving rise to an extremely narrow absorption band.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nanophotonics with Energetic Particles:X-rays and Free Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in precision nanofabrication and atomic design over the past 50 years has ushered in a succession of transformative eras for molding the generation and flow of light. The use of nanoscale and atomic features to design light sources and optical elements-encapsulated by the term nanophotonics-has led to new fundamental science and innovative technologies across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with substantial emphasis on the microwave to visible regimes. In this review, we pay special attention to the impact and potential of nanophotonics in a relatively exotic yet technologically disruptive regime: high-energy particles such as X-ray photons and free electrons-where nanostructures and atomic design open the doors to unprecedented technologies in quantum science and versatile X-ray sources and optics. As the practical generation of X-rays is intrinsically linked to the existence of energetic free or quasi-free-electrons, our review will also capture related phenomena and technologies that combine free electrons with nanophotonics, including free-electron-driven nanophotonics at other photon energies. In particular, we delve into the demonstration and study of quantum recoil in the X-ray regime, the study of nanomaterial design and free-electron wave shaping as means to enhance and control X-ray radiation, examine the free-electron generation enabled by nanophotonics, and analyze the high-harmonic generation by quasi-free electrons. We also discuss applications of quantum nanophotonics for X-rays and free electrons, including nanostructure waveguides for X-rays, photon pair enhanced X-ray imaging, mirrors, and lenses for X-rays, among others.</description>

      <title>Magnetic response of topological insulator layer with metamaterial substrate induced by an electric point source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are materials with unique surface conductive properties that distinguish them from normal insulators and have attracted significant interest due to their potential applications in electronics and spintronics. However, their weak magnetic field response in traditional setups has limited practical applications. Here, we show that integrating TIs with active metamaterial substrates can significantly enhance the induced magnetic field by more than 10^4 times. Our results demonstrate that selecting specific permittivity and permeability values for the active metamaterial substrate optimizes the magnetic field at the interface between the TI layer and the metamaterial, extending into free space. This represents a substantial improvement over previous methods, where the magnetic field decayed rapidly. The findings reveal that the TI-metamaterial approach enhances the magnetic field response, unveiling new aspects of TI electromagnetic behavior and suggesting novel pathways for developing materials with tailored electromagnetic properties. The integration of metamaterials with TIs offers promising opportunities for advancements in materials science and various technological applications. Overall, our study provides a practical and effective approach to exploring the unique magnetic field responses of TIs, potentially benefiting other complex material systems.</description>

      <title>Improvement in the Removal Efficiency of the Ultraviolet Laser Ablation by an Additional Simultaneous Irradiation of a Weak Infrared Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkable improvement in the removal efficiency of the ultraviolet laser (fourth harmonic wave of Nd:YAG laser) ablation was observed by irradiating a weak infrared laser (fundamental wave of Nd:YAG laser) simultaneously and additionally to various kinds of materials, such as copper, acrylic resin, alumina, silicon and amorphous carbon. The improvement ratio ranged from 50% to 280%, while the laser fluency of the infrared laser was as small as about 1.6% of that of the ultraviolet laser. Although, we have not succeed in explaining the reasons why this effect occurs, it will have the potentiality to decrease the photon cost in the wide range of ultraviolet laser machining, because the method and the phenomena are simple and clear. The improvement in the morphology was also observed, when it is applied to the laser lathe micromachining.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Thermal Properties in Multilayer Systems for Advanced Thermoreflectance Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are essential for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, interpreting the signals of these techniques is often complicated by the intricate interdependencies of experimental variables. In this study, we introduce a novel framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to systematically unravel these complex relationships. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify critical combined parameters that define the maximum number of reliably extractable variables in thermoreflectance experiments. We validate our approach through measurements on a GaN/Si heterostructure, comparing the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS in extracting key thermal properties. Our results demonstrate that the SPS method offers superior decoupling of parameters, allowing for more accurate simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance. This work provides a deeper understanding of heat transfer in multilayer systems and offers a robust methodology for improving the precision of thermal property measurements across a wide range of materials, paving the way for advancements in both fundamental research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>
