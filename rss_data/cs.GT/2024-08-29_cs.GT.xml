      <title>A General Framework for Optimizing and Learning Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One key in real-life Nash equilibrium applications is to calibrate players' cost functions. To leverage the approximation ability of neural networks, we proposed a general framework for optimizing and learning Nash equilibrium using neural networks to estimate players' cost functions. Depending on the availability of data, we propose two approaches (a) the two-stage approach: we need the data pair of players' strategy and relevant function value to first learn the players' cost functions by monotonic neural networks or graph neural networks, and then solve the Nash equilibrium with the learned neural networks; (b) the joint approach: we use the data of partial true observation of the equilibrium and contextual information (e.g., weather) to optimize and learn Nash equilibrium simultaneously. The problem is formulated as an optimization problem with equilibrium constraints and solved using a modified Backpropagation Algorithm. The proposed methods are validated in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-uniformly Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-stability and strong stability are properties of a matching in the stable matching problem with ties. In this paper, we introduce a common generalization of super-stability and strong stability, which we call non-uniform stability. First, we prove that we can determine the existence of a non-uniformly stable matching in polynomial time. Next, we give a polyhedral characterization of the set of non-uniformly stable matchings. Finally, we prove that the set of non-uniformly stable matchings forms a distributive lattice.</description>

      <title>Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents for Trustworthy Social Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA) framework, a novel approach to enhance the trustworthiness of social simulations that utilize large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have gained attention as agents for simulating human behaviour, their applicability in this role is limited by issues such as inherent hallucinations and logical inconsistencies. LELMA addresses these challenges by integrating LLMs with symbolic AI, enabling logical verification of the reasoning generated by LLMs. This verification process provides corrective feedback, refining the reasoning output. The framework consists of three main components: an LLM-Reasoner for producing strategic reasoning, an LLM-Translator for mapping natural language reasoning to logic queries, and a Solver for evaluating these queries. This study focuses on decision-making in game-theoretic scenarios as a model of human interaction. Experiments involving the Hawk-Dove game, Prisoner's Dilemma, and Stag Hunt highlight the limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 Omni and Gemini 1.0 Pro, in producing correct reasoning in these contexts. LELMA demonstrates high accuracy in error detection and improves the reasoning correctness of LLMs via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4 Omni.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Price-of-Fair-Sharing using Knapsack-Cover Constraints to guide Near-Optimal Cost-Recovery Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating the cost of providing a service among a set of users, where the service cost is formulated by an NP-hard {\it covering integer program (CIP)}. The central issue is to determine a cost allocation to each user that, in total, recovers as much as possible of the actual cost while satisfying a stabilizing condition known as the {\it core property}. The ratio between the total service cost and the cost recovered from users has been studied previously, with seminal papers of Deng, Ibaraki, \&amp; Nagomochi and Goemans \&amp; Skutella linking this {\it price-of-fair-sharing} to the integrality gap of an associated LP relaxation. Motivated by an application of cost allocation for network design for LPWANs, an emerging IoT technology, we investigate a general class of CIPs and give the first non-trivial price-of-fair-sharing bounds by using the natural LP relaxation strengthened with knapsack-cover inequalities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these LP-based methods outperform previously known methods on an LPWAN-derived CIP data set. We also obtain analogous results for a more general setting in which the service provider also gets to select the subset of users, and the mechanism to elicit users' private utilities should be group-strategyproof. The key to obtaining this result is a simplified and improved analysis for a cross-monotone cost-allocation mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of quantum theory as games between observers and nature played in Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2019, we introduced games in Minkowski spacetime as a generalization of game theory to special relativity that subsumes games in normal form (spacelike separation) and games in extensive form (timelike separation). Many concepts of the game theory literature, including Nash equilibria and flattened strategic forms, naturally extend to spacetime games. We also emphasized the importance of these games to model quantum experiments, such as Bell experiments and more generally any adaptive measurements, from a decision theory perspective. Subsequent work, named causal contextuality scenarios, suggested formalizing a special case of such games in terms of strategy presheaves. If a natural cover is taken, we show that spacetime games recover causal contextuality scenarios as a special case. Spacetime games provide a visual and intuitive framework that captures the distinction between joint experiments and either-or experiments, so that they are rich enough in their causal structure to imply a natural cover for the corresponding causal contextuality scenario. Based on this observation, we suggest defining the strategy presheaf directly based on the pure strategies (and restrictions thereof) in the reduced strategic form of the spacetime game, and we show that the sheaf property obtains for the games at hand. The argument is simple and similar to event sheaves for the flat case. Finally, we explain how, in the other direction, the failure of the sheaf property on strategy distribution presheaves is consistent with our previous argument that Nash game theory is incompatible with quantum physics. This shows that the insights of spacetime games and causal contextuality scenarios, taken together, can contribute positively to the advancement of the field of quantum foundations.</description>
