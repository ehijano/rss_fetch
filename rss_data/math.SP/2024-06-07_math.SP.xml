      <title>A graph without zero in its spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the discrete Laplacian acting on 1-forms and we study its spectrum relative to the spectrum of the 0-form Laplacian. We show that the non zero spectrum can coincide for these Laplacians with the same nature. We examine the characteristics of 0-spectrum of the 1-form Laplacian compared to the cycles of graphs.</description>

      <title>Homology of spectral minimal partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spectral minimal partition of a manifold is its decomposition into disjoint open sets that minimizes a spectral energy functional. It is known that bipartite spectral minimal partitions coincide with nodal partitions of Courant-sharp Laplacian eigenfunctions. However, almost all minimal partitions are non-bipartite. To study those, we define a modified Laplacian operator and prove that the nodal partitions of its Courant-sharp eigenfunctions are minimal within a certain topological class of partitions. This yields new results in the non-bipartite case and recovers the above known result in the bipartite case. Our approach is based on tools from algebraic topology, which we illustrate by a number of examples where the topological types of partitions are characterized by relative homology.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Spectral Invariant Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating spectral information to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has shown promising results but raises a fundamental challenge due to the inherent ambiguity of eigenvectors. Various architectures have been proposed to address this ambiguity, referred to as spectral invariant architectures. Notable examples include GNNs and Graph Transformers that use spectral distances, spectral projection matrices, or other invariant spectral features. However, the potential expressive power of these spectral invariant architectures remains largely unclear. The goal of this work is to gain a deep theoretical understanding of the expressive power obtainable when using spectral features. We first introduce a unified message-passing framework for designing spectral invariant GNNs, called Eigenspace Projection GNN (EPNN). A comprehensive analysis shows that EPNN essentially unifies all prior spectral invariant architectures, in that they are either strictly less expressive or equivalent to EPNN. A fine-grained expressiveness hierarchy among different architectures is also established. On the other hand, we prove that EPNN itself is bounded by a recently proposed class of Subgraph GNNs, implying that all these spectral invariant architectures are strictly less expressive than 3-WL. Finally, we discuss whether using spectral features can gain additional expressiveness when combined with more expressive GNNs.</description>

      <title>Localization for quasi-one-dimensional Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a random family of Dirac operators on $N$ parallel real lines, modelling for example a graphene nanoribbon. We establish a localization criterion involving properties on the group generated by transfer matrices. In particular, we consider not only the case where this group is the symplectic group but also a strict subgroup of it. We establish under quite general hypotheses that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents and the integrated density of states are H\"older continuous. Moreover, for a set of concrete cases where the potentials are on Pauli matrices, we compute the transfer matrices and prove either localization or delocalization, depending on the potential and on the parity of $N$.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between validity of the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality and finiteness of the strict $p$-capacitary inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>
