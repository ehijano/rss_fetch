      <title>Existential fragments of theories of henselian valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fragments of the existential theory of henselian valued fields with parameters. This includes the $\exists_n$-fragment in the equicharacteristic or unramified mixed characteristic case, the $\exists_n\exists_1$-fragment in the equicharacteristic case, and the $\exists_n$-fragment in the residue characteristic zero case. For example, we obtain an unconditional axiomatization (and thereby decidability) of the $\exists_3$-theory of $\mathbb{F}_{q}(\!(t)\!)$ in the language of valued fields with a parameter for $t$.</description>

      <title>Non-meager $\mathsf{P}$-filters, Miller-measurability, and a question of Hru\v{s}\'{a}k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a cardinal $\kappa$ and filters $\mathcal{F}_\alpha$ on $\omega$ for $\alpha\in\kappa$, we will show that if $\prod_{\alpha\in\kappa}\mathcal{F}_\alpha$ is countable dense homogeneous then $\kappa&lt;\mathfrak{p}$ and each $\mathcal{F}_\alpha$ is a non-meager $\mathsf{P}$-filter. This partially answers a question of Michael Hru\v{s}\'{a}k. Along the way, we will show that the product of fewer than $\mathfrak{p}$ non-meager $\mathsf{P}$-filters has the Miller property. We will also describe explicitly the connection between Miller-measurability and the Miller property. As a corollary, we will see that the intersection of fewer than $\mathsf{add}(m^0)$ non-meager $\mathsf{P}$-filters is a non-meager $\mathsf{P}$-filter, where $m^0$ denotes the ideal of Miller-null sets. We will conclude by investigating the preservation of the Miller property under intersections and products.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Behavior of Guessing Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of probabilistic and topological properties of the set of reals that are being guessed by a diamond sequence from \cite{Benhamou_Wu}.
  We show that the existence of sequence of a asymptotic growth $\pi$ which infinitely guesses a probability one set is equivalent to the divergence of $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\pi(n)}{2^n}$. We then provide concrete examples for guessing sequences of certain low asymptotic growth using random walks.
  Finally, we show that the ultrafilter construction from \cite{Benhamou_Wu} always yield an ultrafilters and a sequence which guesses a meager set, while a simple construction using Cohen forcing gives a non-meager set of guessed reals. These results answer \cite[Question 6.13]{Benhamou_Wu} and partially addresses \cite[Question 6.8]{Benhamou_Wu}.</description>

      <title>Uniform Computability of PAC Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniform computability properties of PAC learning using Weihrauch complexity. We focus on closed concept classes, which are either represented by positive, by negative or by full information. Among other results, we prove that proper PAC learning from positive information is equivalent to the limit operation on Baire space, whereas improper PAC learning from positive information is closely related to Weak K\H{o}nig's Lemma and even equivalent to it, when we have some negative information about the admissible hypotheses. If arbitrary hypotheses are allowed, then improper PAC learning from positive information is still in a finitary DNC range, which implies that it is non-deterministically computable, but does not allow for probabilistic algorithms. These results can also be seen as a classification of the degree of constructivity of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning. All the aforementioned results hold if an upper bound of the VC dimension is provided as an additional input information. We also study the question of how these results are affected if the VC dimension is not given, but only promised to be finite or if concept classes are represented by negative or full information. Finally, we also classify the complexity of the VC dimension operation itself, which is a problem that is of independent interest. For positive or full information it turns out to be equivalent to the binary sorting problem, for negative information it is equivalent to the jump of sorting. This classification allows also conclusions regarding the Borel complexity of PAC learnability.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Programming over Linearly Ordered Fields: Decidability and Attainment of Optimal Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical existence theorems and solution methods for quadratic programming traditionally rely on the analytical properties of real numbers, specifically compactness and completeness. These tools are unavailable in general linearly ordered fields, such as the field of rational numbers or non-Archimedean structures, rendering standard analytical proofs insufficient in these general algebraic settings. In this paper, we establish a unified algebraic framework for the decidability of indefinite quadratic programming subject to linear constraints over general linearly ordered fields. We prove a generalized Eaves' theorem, demonstrating that if a quadratic function -- encompassing convex, non-convex, or degenerate (linear) cases -- is bounded from below on a polyhedron, the minimum is attained within the field itself, regardless of topological completeness. Our approach replaces classical analytical arguments with algebraic induction on dimension and polyhedral decomposition. Based on this foundation, we propose an exact, deterministic algorithm within the Blum--Shub--Smale model of computation that decides boundedness and computes a global minimizer using only field operations. We show that the problem is solvable in finite time via a recursive search over orthant-restricted facets. Finally, we note that linearly constrained quadratic programming represents the maximal class of polynomial optimization problems where exact solutions are structurally guaranteed within the original field, thereby demarcating the algebraic boundary of exact optimization over ordered structures.</description>

      <title>Extension of Lipschitz maps definable in Hensel minimal structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.05900v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theorem on extension of Lipschitz maps $f$ definable in Hensel minimal, non-trivially valued fields $K$ of equicharacteristic zero. This may be regarded as a definable, non-Archimedean, non-locally compact version of Kirszbraun's extension theorem. We proceed with double induction with respect to the dimensions of the ambient space and of the domain of $f$. To this end, we introduce the concept of a definable open cell package with a skeleton which, along with the concept of a risometry, plays a key role in our induction procedure.</description>

      <title>Some combinatorial properties of semiselective ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several combinatorial properties of semiselective ideals on the set of natural numbers. The continuum hypothesis implies that the complement of every selective ideal contains a selective ultrafilter, however for semiselective ideals this is not the case. We prove that under certain hypothesis, for instance $V=L$, there are semiselective ideals whose complement does not contain a selective ultrafilter, and that it is also consistent that the complement of every semiselective ideal contains a selective ultrafilter; specifically, we show that if $V=L$ then there is a generic extension of $V$ where this occurs. We present other results concerning semiselective ideals, namely an alternative proof of Ellentuck's theorem for the local Ramsey property, and we prove some facts about the additivity of the ideal of local Ramsey null sets, and also about the generalized Suslin operation on the algebra of local Ramsey sets.</description>

Abstract: In [9] we proved that the space of countable torsion-free abelian groups is Borel complete. In this paper we show that our construction from [9] satisfies several additional properties of interest. We deduce from this that countable torsion-free abelian groups are faithfully Borel complete, in fact, more strongly, we can $\mathfrak{L}_{\omega_1, \omega}$-interpret countable graphs in them. Secondly, we show that the relation of pure embeddability (equiv., elementary embeddability) among countable models of $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}^{(\omega)})$ is a complete analytic quasi-order.</description>

Abstract: We prove that topological isomorphism on $2$-nilpotent procountable groups is not classifiable by countable structures, in the sense of descriptive set theory. In fact, the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty$ that expresses that two sequences of reals have bounded difference is Borel reducible to it. This marks substantial progress on an open problem of [16]: to determine the exact complexity of the isomorphism relation among all non-archimedean Polish groups.</description>

      <title>On the Diophantine problem related to power circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won introduced power circuits in 2012 to construct a polynomial algorithm for the word problem in the Baumslag group, which has a non-elementary Dehn function. Power circuits are circuits supporting addition and operation $(x,y) = x \cdot 2^y$ for integer numbers. Myasnikov, Ushakov and Won posed a question about decidability of the Diophantine problem over the structure $\langle \mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}; +, x \cdot 2^y, \leq, 1 \rangle$, which is closely related to power circuits. In this paper we prove undecidability of the Diophantine problem over this structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given number field $K$, we give a $\forall\exists\forall$-first order description of affine Darmon points over $\mathbb{P}^1_K$, and show that this can be improved to a $\forall\exists$-definition in a remarkable particular case. Darmon points, which are a geometric generalization of perfect powers, constitute a non-linear set-theoretical filtration between $K$ and its ring of $S$-integers, the latter of which can be defined with universal formulas, as has been progressively proven by Koenigsmann, Park, and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison. We also show that our formulas are uniform with respect to all possible $S$, with a parameter-free uniformity, and we compute the number of quantifiers and a bound for the degree of the defining polynomial.</description>

      <title>Locality in Residuated-Lattice Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-valued models generalise the structures from classical model theory by defining truth values for a model with an arbitrary algebra. Just as algebraic varieties provide semantics for many non-classical propositional logics, models defined over algebras in a variety provide the semantics for the corresponding non-classical predicate logics. In particular, models defined over varieties of residuated lattices represent the model theory for first-order substructural logics.
  In this paper we study the extent to which the classical locality theorems from Hanf and Gaifman hold true in the residuated lattice setting. We demonstrate that the answer is sensitive both to how locality is understood in the generalised context and the behaviour of the truth-defining algebra. In the case of Hanf's theorem, we will show that the theorem fails for the natural understanding of local neighbourhoods, but is recoverable with an alternative understanding for well-connected residuated lattices. For Gaifman's theorem, rather than consider Gaifman normal forms directly we focus on the main lemma of the theorem from textbook proofs - that models which satisfy the same basic local sentences are elementarily equivalent. We prove that for a number of different understandings of locality, provided the algebra is well-behaved enough to express locality in its syntax, this main lemma can be recovered. In each case we will see the importance of an order-interpreting connective which creates a link between the modelling relation for models and formulas and the valuation function from formulas into the algebra. This link enables a syntactic encoding of back-and-forth systems providing the main technical ingredient to proofs of the main locality results.</description>

      <title>On smoothness, tangent cones, and the metric geometry of definable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several definitive characterizations of the $C^1$ smoothness of definable sets in terms of their tangent cones and some other metric properties. In particular, we recover some of the beautiful characterizations presented by Ghomi and Howard (2014) and by Kurdyka, Le Gal, and Nhan (2018). For instance, we prove that for any $X\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ that is a locally closed $d$-dimensional definable set in an o-minimal structure, the following items are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is Lipschitz normally embedded (LNE), $C_3(X,p)$ is a $d$-dimensional linear subspace for any $p\in X$ and depends continuously on $p$;
  (2) For each $p\in X$, $X$ is Lipschitz regular at $p$ and $C_4(X,p)$ is a $d$-dimensional linear subspace;
  (3) $X$ is a topological manifold and for each $p\in X$, $X$ is LNE at $p$ and $C_4(X,p)=C_3(X,p)$;
  (4) $X$ is a topological manifold, and $C_5(X,p)$ is a $d-$dimensional subset for any $p\in X$;
  (5) $X$ is $C^1$ smooth.</description>

      <title>Myhill-Nerode for hypergraphs and an application to gain-graphic matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Myhill-Nerode theorem for hypergraphs. The theorem involves an operation which takes two input structures and produces a hypergraph as output. Using this operation, we define a Myhill-Nerode-type equivalence relation and show that if a class of hypergraphs is definable in the counting monadic second-order logic of hypergraphs, then the equivalence relation has finite index. We apply this tool to classes of gain-graphic matroids, and show that if the group $\Gamma$ is not uniformly locally finite, then the class of $\Gamma$\dash gain-graphic matroids is not monadically definable. (A group is uniformly locally finite if, for every $k$, there is a maximum size amongst subgroups generated by at most $k$ elements.) In addition, we define the conviviality graph of a group, and show that if the group $\Gamma$ has an infinite conviviality graph, then the class of $\Gamma$\dash gain-graphic matroids is not monadically definable. This will be useful in future constructions.</description>

      <title>Have a thing? Reasoning around recursion with dynamic typing in grounded arithmetic</title>

Abstract: Neither the classical nor intuitionistic logic traditions are perfectly-aligned with the purpose of reasoning about computation, in that neither tradition can permit unconstrained recursive definitions without inconsistency: recursive logical definitions must normally be proven terminating before admission and use. We introduce grounded arithmetic or GA, a formal-reasoning foundation allowing direct expression of arbitrary recursive definitions. GA adjusts traditional inference rules so that terms that express nonterminating computations harmlessly denote no semantic value (i.e., bottom) instead of yielding inconsistency. Recursive functions may be proven terminating in GA essentially by "dynamically typing" terms, or equivalently, symbolically reverse-executing the computations they denote via GA's inference rules. Once recursive functions have been proven terminating, logical reasoning about their results reduce to the familiar classical rules. A mechanically-checked formal development of basic grounded arithmetic or BGA - a minimal kernel for GA - shows that BGA simultaneously exhibits the useful metalogical properties of being (a) semantically and syntactically consistent, (b) semantically complete, and (c) sufficiently powerful to express and prove the termination of arbitrary closed Turing-complete computations. This combination is impossible in classical logic due to G\"oel's incompleteness theorems, but our results do not contradict G\"odel's theorems because BGA is paracomplete, not classical. Leveraging BGA's power of computation and reflection, we find that grounded logical operators including quantifiers are definable as non-primitive computations in BGA, despite not being included as primitives.</description>
