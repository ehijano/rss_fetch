      <title>Non-linear Phillips Curve for India: Evidence from Explainable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional linear Phillips curve model, while widely used in policymaking, often struggles to deliver accurate forecasts in the presence of structural breaks and inherent nonlinearities. This paper addresses these limitations by leveraging machine learning methods within a New Keynesian Phillips Curve framework to forecast and explain headline inflation in India, a major emerging economy. Our analysis demonstrates that machine learning-based approaches significantly outperform standard linear models in forecasting accuracy. Moreover, by employing explainable machine learning techniques, we reveal that the Phillips curve relationship in India is highly nonlinear, characterized by thresholds and interaction effects among key variables. Headline inflation is primarily driven by inflation expectations, followed by past inflation and the output gap, while supply shocks, except rainfall, exert only a marginal influence. These findings highlight the ability of machine learning models to improve forecast accuracy and uncover complex, nonlinear dynamics in inflation data, offering valuable insights for policymakers.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Data-driven Weights In Multidimensional Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional indexes are ubiquitous, and popular, but present non-negligible normative choices when it comes to attributing weights to their dimensions. This paper provides a more rigorous approach to the choice of weights by defining a set of desirable properties that weighting models should meet. It shows that Bayesian Networks is the only model across statistical, econometric, and machine learning computational models that meets these properties. An example with EU-SILC data illustrates this new approach highlighting its potential for policies.</description>

      <title>Randomization Inference in Two-Sided Market Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized experiments are increasingly employed in two-sided markets, such as buyer-seller platforms, to evaluate treatment effects from marketplace interventions. These experiments must reflect the underlying two-sided market structure in their design (e.g., sellers and buyers), making them particularly challenging to analyze. In this paper, we propose a randomization inference framework to analyze outcomes from such two-sided experiments. Our approach is finite-sample valid under sharp null hypotheses for any test statistic and maintains asymptotic validity under weak null hypotheses through studentization. Moreover, we provide heuristic guidance for choosing among multiple valid randomization tests to enhance statistical power, which we demonstrate empirically. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our methodology through a series of simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Faster estimation of dynamic discrete choice models using index invertibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02171v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many estimators of dynamic discrete choice models with persistent unobserved heterogeneity have desirable statistical properties but are computationally intensive. In this paper we propose a method to quicken estimation for a broad class of dynamic discrete choice problems by exploiting semiparametric index restrictions. Specifically, we propose an estimator for models whose reduced form parameters are invertible functions of one or more linear indices (Ahn, Ichimura, Powell and Ruud 2018), a property we term index invertibility. We establish that index invertibility implies a set of equality constraints on the model parameters. Our proposed estimator uses the equality constraints to decrease the dimension of the optimization problem, thereby generating computational gains. Our main result shows that the proposed estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the unconstrained, computationally heavy estimator. In addition, we provide a series of results on the number of independent index restrictions on the model parameters, providing theoretical guidance on the extent of computational gains. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Inference for Interval-Identified Parameters Selected from an Estimated Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interval identification of parameters such as average treatment effects, average partial effects and welfare is particularly common when using observational data and experimental data with imperfect compliance due to the endogeneity of individuals' treatment uptake. In this setting, the researcher is typically interested in a treatment or policy that is either selected from the estimated set of best-performers or arises from a data-dependent selection rule. In this paper, we develop new inference tools for interval-identified parameters chosen via these forms of selection. We develop three types of confidence intervals for data-dependent and interval-identified parameters, discuss how they apply to several examples of interest and prove their uniform asymptotic validity under weak assumptions.</description>

      <title>Functional Linear Projection and Impulse Response Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes econometric methods for studying how economic variables respond to function-valued shocks. Our methods are developed based on linear projection estimation of predictive regression models with a function-valued predictor and other control variables. We show that the linear projection coefficient associated with the functional variable allows for the impulse response interpretation in a functional structural vector autoregressive model under a certain identification scheme, similar to well-known Sims' (1972) causal chain, but with nontrivial complications in our functional setup. A novel estimator based on an operator Schur complement is proposed and its asymptotic properties are studied. We illustrate its empirical applicability with two examples involving functional variables: economy sentiment distributions and functional monetary policy shocks.</description>
