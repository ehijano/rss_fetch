      <title>Multi-time scale-invariance of turbulence in a shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When time and velocities are dynamically rescaled relative to the instantaneous turnover time, the Sabra shell model acquires another (hidden) form of scaling symmetry. It has been shown previously that this symmetry is statistically restored in the inertial interval of developed turbulence. In this paper we answer the question: what is the general consequence of the restored hidden symmetry for the original variables? We derive the self-similarity rule stating that any (single or multi-time) observable that is time-scale homogeneous of degree $p$ is self-similar with the Holder exponent $h = \zeta_p/p$, where $\zeta_p$ is the usual anomalous exponent. As applications, we formulate self-similarity rules for multi-time structure functions and multi-time Kolmogorov multipliers and verify them numerically.</description>

      <title>OpenFOAMGPT: a RAG-Augmented LLM Agent for OpenFOAM-Based Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a large language model (LLM)-based agent OpenFOAMGPT tailored for OpenFOAM-centric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, leveraging two foundation models from OpenAI: the GPT-4o and a chain-of-thought (CoT)-enabled o1 preview model. Both agents demonstrate success across multiple tasks. While the price of token with o1 model is six times as that of GPT-4o, it consistently exhibits superior performance in handling complex tasks, from zero-shot case setup to boundary condition modifications, turbulence model adjustments, and code translation. Through an iterative correction loop, the agent efficiently addressed single- and multi-phase flow, heat transfer, RANS, LES, and other engineering scenarios, often converging in a limited number of iterations at low token costs. To embed domain-specific knowledge, we employed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, demonstrating how preexisting simulation setups can further specialize the agent for sub-domains such as energy and aerospace. Despite the great performance of the agent, human oversight remains crucial for ensuring accuracy and adapting to shifting contexts. Fluctuations in model performance over time suggest the need for monitoring in mission-critical applications. Although our demonstrations focus on OpenFOAM, the adaptable nature of this framework opens the door to developing LLM-driven agents into a wide range of solvers and codes. By streamlining CFD simulations, this approach has the potential to accelerate both fundamental research and industrial engineering advancements.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fluctuations Inhibit Intermittency in Compressible Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard picture of fully-developed turbulence, highly intermittent hydrodynamic fields are nonlinearly coupled across scales, where local energy cascades from large scales into dissipative vortices and large density gradients. Microscopically, however, constituent fluid molecules are in constant thermal (Brownian) motion, but the role of molecular fluctuations on large-scale turbulence is largely unknown, and with rare exceptions, it has historically been considered irrelevant at scales larger than the molecular mean free path. Recent theoretical and computational investigations have shown that molecular fluctuations can impact energy cascade at Kolmogorov length scales. Here we show that molecular fluctuations not only modify energy spectrum at wavelengths larger than the Kolmogorov length in compressible turbulence, but they also significantly inhibit spatio-temporal intermittency across the entire dissipation range. Using large-scale direct numerical simulations of computational fluctuating hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the extreme intermittency characteristic of turbulence models is replaced by nearly-Gaussian statistics in the dissipation range. These results demonstrate that the compressible Navier-Stokes equations should be augmented with molecular fluctuations to accurately predict turbulence statistics across the dissipation range. Our findings have significant consequences for turbulence modeling in applications such as astrophysics, reactive flows, and hypersonic aerodynamics, where dissipation-range turbulence is approximated by closure models.</description>

      <title>CNN-powered micro- to macro-scale flow modeling in deformable porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel application for predicting the macroscopic intrinsic permeability tensor in deformable porous media, using a limited set of micro-CT images of real microgeometries. The primary goal is to develop an efficient, machine-learning (ML)-based method that overcomes the limitations of traditional permeability estimation techniques, which often rely on time-consuming experiments or computationally expensive fluid dynamics simulations. The novelty of this work lies in leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict pore-fluid flow behavior under deformation and anisotropic flow conditions. Particularly, the described approach employs binarized CT images of porous micro-structure as inputs to predict the symmetric second-order permeability tensor, a critical parameter in continuum porous media flow modeling. The methodology comprises four key steps: (1) constructing a dataset of CT images from Bentheim sandstone at different volumetric strain levels; (2) performing pore-scale simulations of single-phase flow using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate permeability data; (3) training the CNN model with the processed CT images as inputs and permeability tensors as outputs; and (4) exploring techniques to improve model generalization, including data augmentation and alternative CNN architectures. Examples are provided to demonstrate the CNN's capability to accurately predict the permeability tensor, a crucial parameter in various disciplines such as geotechnical engineering, hydrology, and material science. An exemplary source code is made available for interested readers.</description>

      <title>Elasto-visco-plastic flows in benchmark geometries: II. Flow around a Confined Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine computationally the two-dimensional flow of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids around a cylinder symmetrically placed between two plates parallel to its axis. The Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley fluid model is solved via the finite-volume method using the OpenFOAM software. As in viscoplastic materials, unyielded regions arise around the plane of symmetry well ahead or behind the cylinder, as two small islands located above and below the cylinder and as polar caps at the two stagnation points on the cylinder. Most interestingly, under certain conditions, an elongated yielded area around the midplane is predicted downstream of the cylinder, sandwiched between two unyielded areas. This surprising result appears, for example, with Carbopol 0.1% when considering a blockage ratio of 0.5 (the ratio of the cylinder's diameter to the channel's width) and above a critical elastic modulus (G&gt;30 Pa). An approximate semi-analytical solution in the region mentioned above, reveals that it is caused by the intense variation of the stress magnitude there, which may approach the yield stress asymptotically either from above or below, depending on material elasticity. The drag coefficient on the cylinder increases with yield stress and blockage ratio but decreases with material elasticity. The unyielded regions expand as the yield stress increases. They also expand when material elasticity increases because this allows the material to elastically deform more before yielding. Furthermore, by decreasing the elastic modulus or increasing the yield stress beyond a critical value, the yield surface may exhibit damped oscillations, or irregular shapes even without a plane of symmetry, all under creeping flow conditions.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Pitching NACA 0018 Airfoil in Low Reynolds Number Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the aerodynamic performance of the symmetric NACA 0018 airfoil under harmonic pitching motions at low Reynolds numbers, a regime characterized by the presence of laminar separation bubbles and their impact on aerodynamic forces. The analysis encompasses oscillation frequencies of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, and 13.3 Hz, with amplitudes of 4{\deg} and 8{\deg}, along with steady-state simulations conducted for angles of attack up to 20{\deg} to validate the numerical model. The results reveal that the Transition SST turbulence model provides improved predictions of aerodynamic forces at higher Reynolds numbers but struggles at lower Reynolds numbers, where laminar flow effects dominate. The inclusion of the 13.3 Hz frequency, relevant to Darrieus vertical-axis wind turbines, demonstrates the model's effectiveness in capturing dynamic hysteresis loops and reduced oscillations, contrasting with the \(k-\omega\) SST model. Comparisons with XFOIL further highlight challenges in accurately modeling laminar-to-turbulent transitions and dynamic flow phenomena. These findings offer valuable insights into the aerodynamic behavior of thick airfoils under low Reynolds number conditions and contribute to advancing the understanding of turbulence modeling, particularly in applications involving vertical-axis wind turbines.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Continuous Transition in a Fast Rotating Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the saturation of three-dimensional unstable perturbations on a fast rotating turbulent flow using direct numerical simulations (DNSs). Under the effect of Kolmogorov forcing, a transition between states dominated by coherent two-dimensional modes to states with three-dimensional variations (quasi-two-dimensional) is observed as we change the global rotation rate. We find this akin to a critical phenomenon, wherein the order parameter scales with the distance to the critical point raised to an exponent. The exponent itself deviates from the predicted mean field value. Also, the nature of the fluctuations of the order parameter near the critical point indicate the presence of on-off intermittency. The critical rotation rate at which the transition occurs exhibits a linear scaling behaviour with the forcing wave number. A reduced model based on linear stability analysis is used to find the linear threshold estimates; we find these to be in good agreement with the 3D nonlinear DNS results.</description>

      <title>Non-unique self-similar blowups in Sabra models: insights from dynamical systems and machine-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong numerical hints exist in favor of a universal blowup scenario in the Sabra shell model, perhaps the most popular cascade models of 3D turbulence, which features complex velocity variables on a geometric progression of scales $\ell_n \propto \lambda ^{-n}$. The blowup is thought to be of self-similar type and characterized by the finite-time convergence towards a universal profile with non-Kolmogorov (anomalous) small-scale scaling $\propto \ell_n^{x}$. Solving the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem has however proven challenging, and prior insights mainly used the Dombre-Gilson renormalization scheme, transforming self-similar solutions into solitons propagating over infinite rescaled time horizon. Here, we further characterize Sabra blowups by implementing two strategies targeting the eigenvalue problem. The first involves formal expansion in terms of the bookkeeping parameter $\delta = (1-x)\log \lambda$, and interpretes the self-similar solution as a (degenerate) homoclinic bifurcation. Using standard bifurcation toolkits, we show that the homoclinic bifurcations identified under finite-truncation of the series converge to the observed Sabra solution. The second strategy uses machine-learning optimization to solve directly for the Sabra eigenvalue. It reveals an intricate phase space, with the presence of a continuous family of non-universal blowup profiles, characterized by various number $N$ of pulses and exponents $x_N\ge x$.</description>

      <title>Neural equilibria for long-term prediction of nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Discrete Equilibrium (NeurDE), a machine learning (ML) approach for long-term forecasting of flow phenomena that relies on a "lifting" of physical conservation laws into the framework of kinetic theory. The kinetic formulation provides an excellent structure for ML algorithms by separating nonlinear, non-local physics into a nonlinear but local relaxation to equilibrium and a linear non-local transport. This separation allows the ML to focus on the local nonlinear components while addressing the simpler linear transport with efficient classical numerical algorithms. To accomplish this, we design an operator network that maps macroscopic observables to equilibrium states in a manner that maximizes entropy, yielding expressive BGK-type collisions. By incorporating our surrogate equilibrium into the lattice Boltzmann (LB) algorithm, we achieve accurate flow forecasts for a wide range of challenging flows. We show that NeurDE enables accurate prediction of compressible flows, including supersonic flows, while tracking shocks over hundreds of time steps, using a small velocity lattice-a heretofore unattainable feat without expensive numerical root finding.</description>

      <title>Large charge operators at large spin from relativistically rotating vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ground states of CFTs with a global $U(1)$ symmetry on $\mathbb{R}\times S^2$ in the regime of large charge $Q$ and large angular momentum $J$, using large charge EFT. We find that in the range $Q \ll J \ll Q^2$, the ground state solution is a superfluid densely populated with vortices rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. This is a relativistic generalization of the known (non-relativistic) rigid rotation phase, which corresponds to the small $\Omega$ limit of our solution. In the regime $Q^{3/2}\ll J\ll Q^2$, our solution achieves lower energy than previously identified states. In this regime, most of the vortices move near the speed of light, and we obtain the chiral fluctuation modes propagating at the speed of light. Interestingly, we find that our ground state can be interpreted as a zero temperature charged normal fluid rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. We rederive this solution purely from the fluid dynamics. Based on the (already established) applicability of fluid description to large non-supersymmetric extremal AdS black holes, we find that the boundary stress tensor and $U(1)$ current of extremal AdS Kerr-Newman black hole align with those of our solution.</description>

      <title>Review and analysis of thermophysical properties of a sulfuric acid-water electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed a critical review of the thermophysical properties of sulfuric acid-water mixtures. The thermophysical properties analyzed are density, viscosity, refraction index, thermal expansion coefficient, and mass expansion coefficient. The density of the sulfuric acid-water mixture has been measured for different mass fractions, w = 0.1-0.4, over a broad temperatura range, T = 273.15-333.15 K. A new parametrization of the density has been performed using a least-squares method. In this parametrization, the number of coefficients has been reduced with respect to previous works. Moreover, this new equation has been analyzed in an extended region of temperature and concentration in the following ranges: w = 0-0.1 and T = 233.15-373.15 K. The coefficients of thermal and mass expansion have also been calculated experimentally, and a linear relation of the density has been determined as a function of the variations in temperature and concentration. In addition, viscosity and refraction index measurements have been performed at 298.15 and 293.15 K, respectively. Our results have been checked against measurements in the literature (review) and show good correspondence.</description>

      <title>Capillary Pressure-Saturation relation derived from the Pore Morphology Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method to calculate the capillary pressure-saturation relations of immiscible multiphase flow on two-dimensional pore morphologies is presented here. The method is an extension of the Pore Morphology Method that includes wetting angle and trapped mechanism of the displaced fluid, and calculation of material properties by density functional theory. After validating the method with micro-chip fluid injection experiments, the method is used to relate pore morphology to capillary pressure-saturation relation using square-lattice pore morphologies. Because the method uses only morphological binary operations, it is more efficient than well-established high-resolution voxel dynamics methods such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods and Level-set computational fluid dynamics. Apart from pore morphology, only the material parameters related to contact angle (wettability) and interfacial tension are required to connect the pore-saturation relation and pore throat distribution. We investigate the effect on interfacial tension, wettability, sample size, and pore throat distribution on entry pressure and residual saturation.</description>

      <title>Dusty disk as a safe haven for terrestrial planets: Effect of back-reaction of solid material on gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the dust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing growth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted by the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio of protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often neglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the torques felt by low-mass planets. We perform locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the range of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations are compared with and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on the gas. The solid component is assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the range 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater number of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect back-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth and migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas back-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized planetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk containing coupled solid components St&lt;=0.01. Earth-mass planets also experience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid components 2&lt;=St&lt;=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to increase the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results suggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial to the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young planet being engulfed by the central star.</description>

Abstract: Using techniques from many-body quantum theory, we propose a framework for representing the evolution of observables of measure-preserving ergodic flows through infinite-dimensional rotation systems on tori. This approach is based on a class of weighted Fock spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ generated by a 1-parameter family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H_\tau$, and endowed with commutative Banach algebra structure under the symmetric tensor product using a subconvolutive weight $w$. We describe the construction of the spaces $F_w(\mathcal H_\tau)$ and show that their Banach algebra spectra, $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$, decompose into a family of tori of potentially infinite dimension. Spectrally consistent unitary approximations $U^t_\tau$ of the Koopman operator acting on $\mathcal H_\tau$ are then lifted to rotation systems on these tori akin to the topological models of ergodic systems with pure point spectra in the Halmos--von Neumann theorem. Our scheme also employs a procedure for representing observables of the original system by polynomial functions on finite-dimensional tori in $\sigma(F_w(\mathcal H_\tau))$ of arbitrarily large degree, with coefficients determined from pointwise products of eigenfunctions of $U^t_\tau$. This leads to models for the Koopman evolution of observables on $L^2$ built from tensor products of finite collections of approximate Koopman eigenfunctions. Numerically, the scheme is amenable to consistent data-driven implementation using kernel methods. We illustrate it with applications to Stepanoff flows on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system. Connections with quantum computing are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent nonlinear gravity-capillary surface waves with viscous dissipation and wind forcing</title>

Abstract: We develop a time-dependent conformal method to study the effect of viscosity on steep surface waves. When the effect of surface tension is included, numerical solutions are found that contain highly oscillatory parasitic capillary ripples. These small amplitude ripples are associated with the high curvature at the crest of the underlying viscous-gravity wave, and display asymmetry about the wave crest. Previous inviscid studies of steep surface waves have calculated intricate bifurcation structures that appear for small surface tension. We show numerically that viscosity suppresses these. While the discrete solution branches still appear, they collapse to form a single smooth branch in limit of small surface tension. These solutions are shown to be temporally stable, both to small superharmonic perturbations in a linear stability analysis, and to some larger amplitude perturbations in different initial-value problems. Our work provides a convenient method for the numerical computation and analysis of water waves with viscosity, without evaluating the free-boundary problem for the full Navier-Stokes equations which becomes increasingly challenging at larger Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>How turbulence increases the bubble-particle collision rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of turbulence on collisions between a finite-size bubble and small inertial particles based on interface-resolved simulations. Our results show that the interaction with the flow field around the bubble remains the dominant effect. Nonlinear dependencies in this process can enhance the turbulent collision rate by up to 100\% compared to quiescent flow. Fluctuations in the bubble slip velocity during the interaction with the particle additionally increase the collision rate. We present a frozen-turbulence model that captures the relevant effects providing a physically consistent framework to model collisions of small inertial particles with finite-sized objects in turbulence.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplications. The main interface of software libraries for matrix multiplications for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs demonstrated that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the vanilla implementations by several orders of magnitude. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a vanilla implementation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Path of a pair of deformable bubbles rising initially in line and close to a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that in an unbounded fluid, the inline configuration of a freely rising bubble pair is often unstable with respect to lateral disturbances. This work numerically examines the stability of this configuration in the presence of a nearby vertical wall. The focus is on moderately inertial regimes, where two bubbles rising initially in line typically separate laterally from each other under unbounded conditions. In the presence of the wall, our results indicate that while the path of the bubble pair predominantly separates laterally, the plane of separation largely depends on the wall bubble interaction. This interaction involves a competition between two distinct effects, with the dominance determined by the ratios of buoyancy to viscous and buoyancy to capillary forces, which define the Galilei (Ga) and Bond (Bo) numbers, respectively. When Bo is below a critical Ga-dependent threshold, irrotational effects dominate, initially stabilizing both bubbles near the wall until horizontal separation among them occurs in the wall parallel plane. Conversely, at higher Bo, vortical effects dominate such that both bubbles migrate away from the wall. During the departure, asymmetric interactions cause the wall normal velocities of the two bubbles to differ, leading to horizontal separation in the wall-normal plane. These two separation motions, both newly identified in the present study, are found to result from two distinct mechanisms: one associated with the shear flow generated in the gap separating the wall and the leading bubble, which attracts the trailing bubble toward the wall, and the other linked to vortex shedding from the leading bubble, which promotes the trailing bubble's faster escape from the wall.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of a Water Droplet on a Horizontally Vibrating Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Advection-based multiframe iterative correction for pressure estimation from velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method to improve the accuracy of pressure field estimation from time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry data is proposed. This method generates several new time-series of velocity field by propagating in time the original one using an advection-based model, which assumes that small-scale turbulence is advected by large-scale motions. Then smoothing is performed at the corresponding positions across all the generated time-series. The process is repeated through an iterative scheme. The proposed technique smears out spatial noise by exploiting time information. Simultaneously, temporal jitter is repaired using spatial information, enhancing the accuracy of pressure computation via the Navier-Stokes equations. We provide a proof of concept of the method with synthetic datasets based on a channel flow and the wake of a 2D wing. Different noise models are tested, including Gaussian white noise and errors with some degree of spatial coherence. Additionally, the filter is evaluated on an experimental test case of the wake of an airfoil, where pressure field ground truth is not available. The result shows the proposed method performs better than conventional filters in velocity and pressure field estimation, especially when spatially coherent errors are present. The method is of direct application in advection-dominated flows, although its extension with more advanced models is straightforward.</description>

      <title>A Novel Training Framework for Physics-informed Neural Networks: Towards Real-time Applications in Ultrafast Ultrasound Blood Flow Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast ultrasound blood flow imaging is a state-of-the-art technique for depiction of complex blood flow dynamics in vivo through thousands of full-view image data (or, timestamps) acquired per second. Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is one of the most preeminent solvers of the Navier-Stokes equations, widely used as the governing equation of blood flow. However, that current approaches rely on full Navier-Stokes equations is impractical for ultrafast ultrasound. We hereby propose a novel PINN training framework for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It involves discretizing Navier-Stokes equations into steady state and sequentially solving them with test-time adaptation. The novel training framework is coined as SeqPINN. Upon its success, we propose a parallel training scheme for all timestamps based on averaged constant stochastic gradient descent as initialization. Uncertainty estimation through Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian is then used as an indicator of generalizability of the initialization. This algorithm, named SP-PINN, further expedites training of PINN while achieving comparable accuracy with SeqPINN. The performance of SeqPINN and SP-PINN was evaluated through finite-element simulations and in vitro phantoms of single-branch and trifurcate blood vessels. Results show that both algorithms were manyfold faster than the original design of PINN, while respectively achieving Root Mean Square Errors of 0.63 cm/s and 0.81 cm/s on the straight vessel and 1.35 cm/s and 1.63 cm/s on the trifurcate vessel when recovering blood flow velocities. The successful implementation of SeqPINN and SP-PINN open the gate for real-time training of PINN for Navier-Stokes equations and subsequently reliable imaging-based blood flow assessment in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition From Turbulence To Zonal Flows In The Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition between two-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence and quasi-one-dimensional zonostrophic turbulence is examined in the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system, which is considered as a minimal model of $\beta$-plane-like drift-wave turbulence with an intrinsic instability. Extensive parameter scans were performed across a wide range of values for the adiabaticity parameter $C$ describing the strength of coupling between the two equations. A sharp transition from 2D isotropic turbulence to a quasi-1D system, dominated by zonal flows, is observed using the fraction of the kinetic energy of the zonal modes as the order parameter, at $C\approx0.1$. It is shown that this transition exhibits a hysteresis loop around the transition point, where the adiabaticity parameter plays the role of the control parameter of its non-linear self-organisation. It was also observed that the radial particle flux scales with the adiabaticity parameter following two different power law dependencies in the two regimes. A simple quasi-linear saturation rule which accounts for the presence of zonal flows is proposed, and is shown to agree very well with the observed nonlinear fluxes. Motivated by the phenomenon of quasi-one dimensionalisation of the system at high $C$, a number of reduction schemes based on a limited number of modes were investigated and the results were compared to direct numerical simulations. In particular, it was observed that a minimal reduced model consisting of $2$ poloidal and $2$ radial modes was able to replicate the phase transition behaviour, while any further reduction failed to capture it.</description>

      <title>Does Yakhot's growth law for turbulent burning velocity hold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using formal renormalization theory, Yakhot derived in ([32], 1988) an $O\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{\log A}}\right)$ growth law of the turbulent flame speed with respect to large flow intensity $A$ based on the inviscid G-equation. Although this growth law is widely cited in combustion literature, there has been no rigorous mathematical discussion to date about its validity. As a first step towards unveiling the mystery, we prove that there is no intermediate growth law between $O\left(\frac{A}{\log A}\right)$ and $O(A)$ for two dimensional incompressible Lipschitz continuous periodic flows with bounded swirl sizes. In particular, we do not assume the non-degeneracy of critical points. Additionally, other examples of flows with lower regularity, Lagrangian chaos, and related phenomena are also discussed.</description>
