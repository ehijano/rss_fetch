      <title>Estimation of the Acoustic Field in a Uniform Duct with Mean Flow using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of sound propagation in a uniform duct having a mean flow has many applications, such as in the design of gas turbines, heating, ventilation and air conditioning ducts, automotive intake and exhaust systems, and in the modeling of speech. In this paper, the convective effects of the mean flow on the plane wave acoustic field inside a uniform duct were studied using artificial neural networks. The governing differential equation and the associated boundary conditions form a constrained optimization problem. It is converted to an unconstrained optimization problem and solved by approximating the acoustic field variable to a neural network. The complex-valued acoustic pressure and particle velocity were predicted at different frequencies, and validated against the analytical solution and the finite element models. The effect of the mean flow is studied in terms of the acoustic impedance. A closed-form expression that describes the influence of various factors on the acoustic field is derived.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Dynamics Framework with Neural Fields for 3D Spatio-temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a neural framework that predicts 3D vehicle collision dynamics by independently modeling global rigid-body motion and local structural deformation. Unlike approaches directly predicting absolute displacement, this method explicitly separates the vehicle's overall translation and rotation from its structural deformation. Two specialized networks form the core of the framework: a quaternion-based Rigid Net for rigid motion and a coordinate-based Deformation Net for local deformation. By independently handling fundamentally distinct physical phenomena, the proposed architecture achieves accurate predictions without requiring separate supervision for each component. The model, trained on only 10% of available simulation data, significantly outperforms baseline models, including single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep operator networks (DeepONet), with prediction errors reduced by up to 83%. Extensive validation demonstrates strong generalization to collision conditions outside the training range, accurately predicting responses even under severe impacts involving extreme velocities and large impact angles. Furthermore, the framework successfully reconstructs high-resolution deformation details from low-resolution inputs without increased computational effort. Consequently, the proposed approach provides an effective, computationally efficient method for rapid and reliable assessment of vehicle safety across complex collision scenarios, substantially reducing the required simulation data and time while preserving prediction fidelity.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of calibration techniques for finite strain elastoplasticity: Numerically-exact sensitivities for FEMU and VFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of material parameters is crucial for predictive modeling in computational mechanics. The two primary approaches in the experimental mechanics' community for calibration from full-field digital image correlation data are known as finite element model updating (FEMU) and the virtual fields method (VFM). In VFM, the objective function is a squared mismatch between internal and external virtual work or power. In FEMU, the objective function quantifies the weighted mismatch between model predictions and corresponding experimentally measured quantities of interest. It is minimized by iteratively updating the parameters of an FE model. While FEMU is seen as more flexible, VFM is commonly used instead of FEMU due to its considerably greater computational expense. However, comparisons between the two methods usually involve approximations of gradients or sensitivities with finite difference schemes, thereby making direct assessments difficult. Hence, in this study, we rigorously compare VFM and FEMU in the context of numerically-exact sensitivities obtained through local sensitivity analyses and the application of automatic differentiation software. To this end, both methods are tested on a finite strain elastoplasticity model. We conduct a series of test cases to assess both methods' robustness under practical challenges.</description>

      <title>Characteristic boundary conditions for Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the concept of characteristic boundary conditions (CBCs) within the framework of Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods, including both the Navier-Stokes characteristic boundary conditions (NSCBCs) and a novel approach to generalized characteristic relaxation boundary conditions (GRCBCs). CBCs are based on the characteristic decomposition of the compressible Euler equations and are designed to prevent the reflection of waves at the domain boundaries. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method for weakly compressible flows through a series of numerical experiments by comparing the results with common boundary conditions in the HDG setting and reference solutions available in the literature. In particular, HDG with CBCs show superior performance minimizing the reflection of vortices at artificial boundaries, for both inviscid and viscous flows.</description>

      <title>Mechanical State Estimation with a Polynomial-Chaos-Based Statistical Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Statistical Finite Element Method (statFEM) offers a Bayesian framework for integrating computational models with observational data, thus providing improved predictions for structural health monitoring and digital twinning. This paper presents an efficient sampling-free statFEM tailored for non-conjugate, non-Gaussian prior probability densities. We assume that constitutive parameters, modeled as weakly stationary random fields, are the primary source of uncertainty and approximate them using Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansion. The resulting stochastic solution field, i.e., the displacement field, is a non-stationary, non-Gaussian random field, which we approximate via Polynomial Chaos (PC) expansion. The PC coefficients are determined through projection using Smolyak sparse grids. Additionally, we model the measurement noise as a stationary Gaussian random field and the model misspecification as a mean-free, non-stationary Gaussian random field, which is also approximated using KL expansion. The coefficients of the KL expansion are treated as hyperparameters. The PC coefficients of the stochastic posterior displacement field are computed using the Gauss-Markov-K\'alm\'an filter, while the hyperparameters are determined by maximizing the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate the efficiency and convergence of the proposed method through one- and two-dimensional elastostatic problems.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Placement Optimization in Vietnam Using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vietnam is viewed as one of the promising markets for electric vehicles (EVs), especially automobiles, when it is predicted to reach 1 million in 2028 and 3.5 million in 2040. However, the lack of charging station infrastructure has hindered the growth rate of EVs in this country. This study aims to propose an optimization model using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming to implement an optimal location strategy for EVs charging stations in Ho Chi Minh City. The problem is solved by Gurobi using the Brand-and-Cut method. There are two perspectives, including Charging Station Operators and EV users. In addition, 7 kinds of costs are considered. From 1509 Point of Interest and 199 residential areas, 134 POIs were chosen with 923 charging stations to fully satisfy the customer demand. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed model is proved by a minor MIP Gap and running in a short time with full feasibility.</description>
