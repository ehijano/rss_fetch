      <title>Spin hierarchy in van der Waals molecule formation via ultracold three-body recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the product-state distribution of weakly bound diatomic van der Waals molecules via ultracold three-body recombination of bosonic alkali atoms. We find a two-level hierarchy of spin propensity rules at zero magnetic field. The primary propensity rule states that nearly all molecular products conserve the total hyperfine spin of reactant atomic pairs, while molecular products not conserving the total spin are highly suppressed. For the dominant molecular products, there is a secondary propensity to conserve certain spin components of the reactant pair such as the atomic hyperfine spins, or the total electronic or nuclear spins. The second propensity varies across species and depends fundamentally on the interplay between effective electronic exchange and hyperfine interactions. The spin sensitivity of product-state distribution can potentially open up new avenues for controlling state-to-state reaction rates in ultracold three-body recombination.</description>

      <title>Continuous cavity-QED with an atomic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atoms coupled to cavities provide an exciting playground for the study of fundamental interactions of atoms mediated through a common channel. Many of the applications of cavity-QED and cold-atom experiments more broadly, suffer from limitations caused by the transient nature of an atomic loading cycle. The development of continuous operation schemes is necessary to push these systems to the next level of performance. Here we present a machine designed to produce a continuous flux of collimated atoms that traverse an optical cavity. The atom-light interaction is enhanced by a fast-decaying cavity optimal for studying phenomena where atomic properties dominate. We demonstrate the transition to a collective strong coupling regime heralded by a normal-mode splitting. We observe a second phase with a binary normal-mode splitting born from an offset in the mean velocity of the atoms. Inverting the atomic ensemble in the collective strong coupling regime, we measure continuous optical gain. This work sets the stage for studying threshold conditions for continuous collective phenomena, such as continuous superradiant lasing.</description>

      <title>Probing molecular photophysics in a matter-wave interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</description>

      <title>Preserving Surface Strain in Nanocatalysts via Morphology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering strain critically affects the properties of materials and has extensive applications in semiconductors and quantum systems. However, the deployment of strain-engineered nanocatalysts faces challenges, particularly in maintaining highly strained nanocrystals under reaction conditions. Here, we introduce a morphology-dependent effect that stabilizes surface strain even under harsh reaction conditions. Employing four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we discovered that core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles with sharp-edged morphologies sustain coherent heteroepitaxial interfaces with designated surface strain. This configuration inhibits dislocation due to reduced shear stress at corners, as molecular dynamics simulations indicate. Demonstrated in a Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction, our approach achieves a fourfold increase in activity over conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the enhanced stability of surface strain. These findings contribute to advancing the development of advanced nanocatalysts and indicate broader applications for strain engineering in various fields.</description>

      <title>Scars of Kramers-Henneberger atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron motion in an atom driven by an intense linearly polarized laser field can exhibit a laser-dressed stable state, referred to as the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) state or KH atom. Up to now, the existence conditions of this state rely on the presence of a double well in the KH potential, obtained by averaging the motion over one period of the laser. However, the approximation involved in the averaging is largely invalid in the region of the double well structure; therefore this raises the question of its relevance for identifying signatures of these exotic states. Here we present a method to establish conditions for the existence of the KH atom based on a nonperturbative approach. We show that the KH atom is structured by an asymmetric periodic orbit with the same period as the laser field in a wide range of laser parameters. Its imprint is clearly visible on the wavefunction in quantum simulations. We identify the range of parameters for which this KH state is effective, corresponding to an elliptic periodic orbit.</description>

      <title>Measuring a single atom's position with extreme sub-wavelength resolution and force measurements in the yoctonewton range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The center-of-mass position of a single trapped atomic ion is measured and tracked in time with high precision. Employing a near-resonant radio frequency field of wavelength 2.37 cm and a static magnetic field gradient of 19 T/m, the spatial location of the ion is determined with an unprecedented wavelength-relative resolution of 5 $\times$ 10$^{-9}$, corresponding to an absolute precision of 0.12 nm. Measurements of an electrostatic force on a single ion demonstrate a sensitivity of 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{-23} ~\text{N}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. The real-time measurement of an atom's position complements the well-established technique of scanning near-field radio frequency transmission microscopy and opens up a novel route to using this method with path breaking spatial and force resolution.</description>

      <title>Collective flow of fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting mixtures of bosons and fermions are ubiquitous in nature. They form the backbone of the standard model of physics, provide a framework for understanding quantum materials and are of technological importance in helium dilution refrigerators. However, the description of their coupled thermodynamics and collective behaviour is challenging. Bose-Fermi mixtures of ultracold atoms provide a platform to investigate their properties in a highly controllable environment, where the species concentration and interaction strength can be tuned at will. Here we characterize the collective oscillations of spin-polarized fermionic impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the interaction strength and temperature. For strong interactions, the Fermi gas perfectly mimics the superfluid hydrodynamic modes of the condensate, from low-energy quadrupole modes to high-order Faraday excitations. With an increasing number of bosonic thermal excitations, the dynamics of the impurities cross over from the collisionless to the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional electron fluids.</description>

      <title>Mollow-like triplets in ultra-fast resonant absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric, which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic physics.</description>
