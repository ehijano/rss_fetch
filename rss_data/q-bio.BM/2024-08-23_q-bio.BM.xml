      <title>Dynamic PDB: A New Dataset and a SE(3) Model Extension by Integrating Dynamic Behaviors and Physical Properties in Protein Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in static protein structure collection and prediction, the dynamic behavior of proteins, one of their most vital characteristics, has been largely overlooked in prior research. This oversight can be attributed to the limited availability, diversity, and heterogeneity of dynamic protein datasets. To address this gap, we propose to enhance existing prestigious static 3D protein structural databases, such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), by integrating dynamic data and additional physical properties. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale dataset, Dynamic PDB, encompassing approximately 12.6K proteins, each subjected to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations lasting 1 microsecond to capture conformational changes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive suite of physical properties, including atomic velocities and forces, potential and kinetic energies of proteins, and the temperature of the simulation environment, recorded at 1 picosecond intervals throughout the simulations. For benchmarking purposes, we evaluate state-of-the-art methods on the proposed dataset for the task of trajectory prediction. To demonstrate the value of integrating richer physical properties in the study of protein dynamics and related model design, we base our approach on the SE(3) diffusion model and incorporate these physical properties into the trajectory prediction process. Preliminary results indicate that this straightforward extension of the SE(3) model yields improved accuracy, as measured by MAE and RMSD, when the proposed physical properties are taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Crossing New Frontiers: Knowledge-Augmented Large Language Model Prompting for Zero-Shot Text-Based De Novo Molecule Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule design is a multifaceted approach that leverages computational methods and experiments to optimize molecular properties, fast-tracking new drug discoveries, innovative material development, and more efficient chemical processes. Recently, text-based molecule design has emerged, inspired by next-generation AI tasks analogous to foundational vision-language models. Our study explores the use of knowledge-augmented prompting of large language models (LLMs) for the zero-shot text-conditional de novo molecular generation task. Our approach uses task-specific instructions and a few demonstrations to address distributional shift challenges when constructing augmented prompts for querying LLMs to generate molecules consistent with technical descriptions. Our framework proves effective, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Hairygami: Analysis of DNA Nanostructures' Conformational Change Driven by Functionalizable Overhangs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DNA origami is a widely used method to construct nanostructures by self-assembling designed DNA strands. These structures are often used as "pegboards" for templated assembly of proteins, gold nanoparticles, aptamers, and other molecules, with applications ranging from therapeutics and diagnostics to plasmonics and photonics.
  Imaging these structures using AFM or TEM does not capture their full conformation ensemble as they only show their shape flattened on a surface. However, certain conformations of the nanostructure can position guest molecules into distances unaccounted for in their intended design, thus leading to spurious interactions between guest molecules that are designed to be separated. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to capture conformational ensemble of 2D DNA origami tiles and show that introducing single-stranded overhangs, which are typically used for functionalization of the origami with guest molecules, induces a curvature of the tile structure in the bulk. We show that the shape deformation is of entropic origin, with implications for design of robust DNA origami breadboards as well as potential approach to modulate structure shape by introducing overhangs. We then verify experimentally that the DNA overhangs introduce curvature into the DNA origami tiles in divalent as well as monovalent salt buffer conditions. We further experimentally verify that DNA origami functionalized with attached proteins also experience such induced curvature. We provide the developed simulation code implementing the enhanced sampling to characterize conformational space of DNA origami as open source software.</description>

      <title>Corrected Hill Function in Stochastic Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03057v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Describing reaction rates in stochastic bio-circuits is commonly done by directly introducing the deterministically deduced Hill function into the master equation. However, when fluctuations in enzymatic reaction rates are not neglectable, the Hill function must be derived, considering all the involved stochastic reactions. In this work, we derived the stochastic version of the Hill function from the master equation of the complete set of reactions that, in the macroscopic limit, lead to the Hill function reaction rate. We performed a series expansion around the average values of the concentrations, which allowed us to find corrections for the deterministic Hill function. This process allowed us to quantify the fluctuations of enzymatic reactions. We found that the underlying variability in propensity rates of gene regulatory networks has an important non-linear effect that reduces the intrinsic fluctuations of the mRNA and protein concentrations.</description>

      <title>Reshaping and Enzymatic Activity may allow Viruses to move through the Mucus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentous viruses like influenza and torovirus often display systematic bends and arcs of mysterious physical origin. We propose that such viruses undergo an instability from a cylindrically symmetric to a toroidally curved state. This ``toro-elastic'' state emerges via spontaneous symmetry breaking under prestress due to short range spike protein interactions magnified by %the filament's surface topography. Once surface stresses are sufficiently large, the filament buckles and the curved state constitutes a soft mode that can potentially propagate through the filament's material frame around a mexican-hat-type potential. In the mucus of our airways, which constitutes a soft, porous 3D network, glycan chains are omnipresent and influenza's spike proteins are known to efficiently bind and cut them. We next show that such a non-equilibrium enzymatic reaction can induce spontaneous rotation of the curved state, leading to a whole body reshaping propulsion similar to -- but different from -- eukaryotic flagella and spirochetes.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Molecular Property Prediction: A Survey of Single and Multimodal Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, spanning drug discovery, material science, and environmental chemistry. Fueled by the exponential growth of chemical data and the evolution of artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed remarkable strides in MPP. However, the multifaceted nature of molecular data, such as molecular structures, SMILES notation, and molecular images, continues to pose a fundamental challenge in its effective representation. To address this, representation learning techniques are instrumental as they acquire informative and interpretable representations of molecular data. This article explores recent AI/-based approaches in MPP, focusing on both single and multiple modality representation techniques. It provides an overview of various molecule representations and encoding schemes, categorizes MPP methods by their use of modalities, and outlines datasets and tools available for feature generation. The article also analyzes the performance of recent methods and suggests future research directions to advance the field of MPP.</description>
