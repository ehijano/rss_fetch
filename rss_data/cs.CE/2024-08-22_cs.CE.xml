      <title>The continuous accumulation of civilization core in the cycle of elements-creature, benefits and weapons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comprehensive strength of a country varies from strong to weak, divided into three condition: descending, periodicity destruction or rapidly rising, Exploring the differences can solve the development crisis. the most important things for a country are interests, weapons and creature, corresponding to money, technology and people. The ship industry has two attribute of financial benefits and technological weapons. Commercial ships can transport massive commodity and warships carry updating of massive technological weapons; But a new core: equity incentives have emerged, and it has helped the rapid development of the computer industry. This article uses comparative analysis and comparative historical analysis to observe the changes in the United States and China after the mutual circulation of two elements and the double circulation of three elements in history, such as the growth rates of GDP and patent applications. Then, it summarizes the changes brought by the core of civilization to the country.Through this article, it can be concluded that the core of civilization consists of ships and equity incentives; Through the circulation of new elements, a country can transform into civilizations with three cycles, achieving mutual circulation among the three and enhancing endogenous power; The core of civilization can enhance the stability of economic development, prevent economic crises, and achieve a more balanced civilization.</description>

      <title>ProteinGPT: Multimodal LLM for Protein Property Prediction and Structure Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires detailed analysis of protein structures and sequences, a task in protein research that is inherently complex and time-consuming when performed manually. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation adaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures accurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying protein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising responses to proteins and their corresponding questions.</description>

      <title>GTFS2STN: Analyzing GTFS Transit Data by Generating Spatiotemporal Transit Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is an open standard format for recording transit information, utilized by thousands of transit agencies worldwide. This study introduces GTFS2STN, a novel tool that converts static GTFS transit networks into spatiotemporal networks, connecting bus stops across space and time. This transformation enables comprehensive analysis of transit system accessibility. Additionally, we present a web-based application version of the GTFS2STN tool that allows users to generate spatiotemporal networks online and perform basic analyses, including the creation of isochrone maps from a given origin and the calculation of travel time variability between origin-destination pairs over time. Comparative analysis demonstrates that GTFS2STN produces results similar to those of Mapnificent, an existing open-source tool for generating isochrone maps from GTFS inputs. Compared with Mapnificent, GTFS2STN offers enhanced flexibility for researchers and planners to evaluate transit plans, as it allows users to upload and analyze historical or suggested GTFS feeds from any transit agency. This feature facilitates the assessment of accessibility and travel time variability in transit networks over extended periods, making GTFS2STN a valuable tool for the planning and research for the transit systems.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Material Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials, with their symmetrical and periodic structures, possess a diverse array of properties and have been widely used in various fields, e.g., sustainable development. To discover crystalline materials, traditional experimental and computational approaches are often time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and force field development; these tasks are essential for scientific research and development in crystalline materials science. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic research to summarize their correlations, distinctions, and limitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in deep learning-based material discovery in recent years. We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in material discovery tasks. We also point out the remaining challenges and propose several future directions. The main goal of this review is to offer comprehensive and valuable insights and foster progress in the intersection of artificial intelligence and material science.</description>
