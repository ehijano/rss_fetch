      <title>Self-Dual Cone Systems and Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of self-dual tensor products for finite-dimensional convex cones and operator systems. This is a consequence of a more general result: Every cone system, which is contained in its dual, can be enlarged to a self-dual cone system. Using the setup of cone systems, we further describe how all functorial tensor products of finite-dimensional cones and operator systems explicitly arise from the minimal and maximal tensor product.</description>

      <title>Moment property and positivity for some algebras of fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T. M. Bisgaard proved that the $*$-algebra ${\bf C}[z,\overline{z},1/z\overline{z}]$ has the moment property, that is, each positive linear functional on this $*$-algebra is a moment functional. We generalize this result to polynomials in $d$ variables $z_1,...,z_d$. We prove that there exist $3d-2$ linear polynomials as denominators such that the corresponding $*$-algebra has the moment property, while for 3 linear polynomials in case $d=2$ the moment property always fails. Further, it is shown that for the real algebras ${\bf R}[x,y,1/(x^2+y^2)]$ (the hermitean part of ${\bf C}[z,\overline{z},1/z\overline{z}]$) and ${\bf R}[x,y,x^2/(x^2+y^2),xy/(x^2+y^2)]$, all positive semidefinite elements are sums of squares. These results are used to prove that for the semigroup $*$-algebras of ${\bf Z}^2$, ${\bf N}_0\times{\bf Z}$ and ${\mathsf N}_+:=\{(k,n)\in{\bf Z}^2:k+n\geq 0\}$, all positive semidefinite elements are sums of hermitean squares.</description>

      <title>On relations between some types of convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show how the superquadratic functions can be used as a tool for researching other types of convex functions like $\phi $-convexity, strong-convexity and uniform convexity. We show how to use inequalities satisfied by superquadratic functions and how to adapt the technique used to get them in order to obtain new results satisfied by uniformly convex functions and to $\phi $-convex functions.
  Also, we show examples that emphasize relations between superquadracity and some other types of convex functions</description>

      <title>Lifting MGARD: construction of (pre)wavelets on the interval using polynomial predictors of arbitrary order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MGARD (MultiGrid Adaptive Reduction of Data) is an algorithm for compressing and refactoring scientific data, based on the theory of multigrid methods. The core algorithm is built around stable multilevel decompositions of conforming piecewise linear $C^0$ finite element spaces, enabling accurate error control in various norms and derived quantities of interest. In this work, we extend this construction to arbitrary order Lagrange finite elements $\mathbb{Q}_p$, $p \geq 0$, and propose a reformulation of the algorithm as a lifting scheme with polynomial predictors of arbitrary order. Additionally, a new formulation using a compactly supported wavelet basis is discussed, and an explicit construction of the proposed wavelet transform for uniform dyadic grids is described.</description>

      <title>Fading memory and the convolution theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several topological and analytical notions of continuity and fading memory for causal and time-invariant filters are introduced, and the relations between them are analysed. A significant generalization of the convolution theorem that establishes the equivalence between the fading memory property and the availability of convolution representations of linear filters is proved. This result extends a previous such characterization to a complete array of weighted norms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally, the main theorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can be characterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by the fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological notions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property. Finally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are Hilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading memory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and approximation results of solutions of kernel regressions in the presence of finite data sets.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems consisting of non-invertible continuous maps on an interval are studied. It is proved that if they satisfy the recently introduced so-called $\mu$-injectivity and some mild assumptions, then proximality, asymptotic stability and a central limit theorem hold.</description>

      <title>Probability graphons and P-variables: two equivalent viewpoints for dense weighted graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop further the graph limit theory for dense weighted graph sequences. In particular, we consider probability graphons, which have recently appeared in graph limit theory as continuum representations of weighted graphs, and we introduce P-variables, which also appear in the context of the Aldous-Hoover theorem for exchangeable infinite random arrays, as an alternative continuum representation for weighted graphs. In particular, we explain how P-variables are related to probability graphons in a similar way in which random variables are related to probability measures. We define a metric for P-variables (inspired by action convergence in the graph limit theory of sparse graph sequences) and show that convergence of P-variables in this metric is equivalent to probability graphons convergence. We exploit this equivalence to translate several results from the theory of probability graphons to P-variables. In addition, we prove several properties of P-variables convergence, thus showing new properties also for probability graphons convergence and demonstrating the power of the connection between probability graphons and P-variables. Furthermore, we show how P-variables convergence can be easily modified and generalised to cover other combinatorial structures such as bipartite graphs and hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A characterization of joint completely alternating nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize joint completely alternating nets in terms of joint completely monotonic nets. We also discuss completely alternating sequences induced by a class of rational functions. Using the elementary techniques, we obtain a set of conditions sufficient to determine completely alternating sequences interpolated by a class of rational functions. As an application, we obtain a complete characterization of several classes of joint completely monotonic nets induced by rational functions in two variables.</description>

      <title>Characterization of fractional Sobolev--Poincar\'e and (localized) Hardy inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06636v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove capacitary versions of the fractional Sobolev--Poincar\'e inequalities. We characterize localized variant of the boundary fractional Sobolev--Poincar\'e inequalities through uniform fatness condition of the domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Existence type results on the fractional Hardy inequality are established in the supercritical case $sp&gt;n$ for $s\in(0,1)$, $p&gt;1$. Characterization of the fractional Hardy inequality through weak supersolution of the associate problem is also addressed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove extension results for functions in Besov spaces. Our results are new in the homogeneous setting, while our technique applies equally in the inhomogeneous setting to obtain new proofs of classical results. While our results include $p&gt;1$, of principle interest is the case $p=1$, where we show that \begin{equation*} \int_{\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n+1}}t^{a}|\nabla^{m+1}u(x,t)|\;dtdx\lesssim\left\vert f\right\vert _{B^{m-a,1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})} \end{equation*} for all $f \in \dot{B}^{m-a,1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ (the homogeneous Besov space) where $u$ is a suitably scaled heat extension of $f$.</description>

      <title>$BMO$ and gradient estimates for solutions of critical elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore several applications of the recently introduced spaces of functions of bounded $\beta$-dimensional mean oscillation for $\beta \in (0,n]$ to regularity theory of critical exponent elliptic equations.
  We first show that functions with gradient in weak-$L^n$ are in $BMO^\beta$ for any $\beta \in (0,n]$, improving the classical result $\nabla u\in L^n$ implies $u\in BMO$. We apply this result to the Poisson equation $-\Delta u = \operatorname*{div} F$ with zero boundary conditions in a bounded $C^1$ domain to show that $u\in BMO^{\beta}$ when $F$ is in weak-$L^n$. Next, we consider the $n$-Laplace equation \begin{align*} -\operatorname*{div}( |\nabla U|^{n-2} \nabla U) &amp;= F \text{ in } \Omega, \newline
  U &amp;=0 \text{ on }\partial \Omega. \end{align*} with $F\in L^1(\Omega)$ and show that the classical result $u\in BMO$ can be improved to $u\in BMO^\beta$. Finally, we consider the $n$-Laplace equation in the case when $F \in L^1$, $\operatorname*{div} F=0$ and prove that for smooth domains $\Omega$ we have the estimate \begin{align*} \|\nabla U \|_{L^n} \mathbb \leq C \, \|F\|^{1/(n-1)}_{L^1}, \end{align*} where the constant $C$ is independent of $F$.</description>
