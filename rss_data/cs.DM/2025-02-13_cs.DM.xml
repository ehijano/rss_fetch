      <title>Low-temperature Sampling on Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider sampling in the so-called low-temperature regime, which is typically characterised by non-local behaviour and strong global correlations. Canonical examples include sampling independent sets on bipartite graphs and sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model. Low-temperature sampling is computationally intractable for general graphs, but recent advances based on the polymer method have made significant progress for graph families that exhibit certain expansion properties that reinforce the correlations, including for example expanders, lattices and dense graphs.
  One of the most natural graph classes that has so far escaped this algorithmic framework is the class of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs whose expansion only manifests for sufficiently large subsets of vertices; small sets of vertices on the other hand have vanishing expansion which makes them behave independently from the bulk of the graph and therefore weakens the correlations. At a more technical level, the expansion of small sets is crucial for establishing the Kotecky-Priess condition which underpins the applicability of the framework.
  Our main contribution is to develop the polymer method in the low-temperature regime for sparse random graphs. As our running example, we use the Potts and random-cluster models on $G(n,d/n)$ for $d=\Theta(1)$, where we show a polynomial-time sampling algorithm for all sufficiently large $q$ and $d$, at all temperatures. Our approach applies more generally for models that are monotone. Key to our result is a simple polymer definition that blends easily with the connectivity properties of the graph and allows us to show that polymers have size at most $O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Minimum stationary values of sparse random directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.07246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the stationary distribution of the simple random walk on the directed configuration model with bounded degrees. Provided that the minimum out-degree is at least $2$, with high probability (whp) there is a unique stationary distribution. We show that the minimum positive stationary value is whp $n^{-(1+C+o(1))}$ for some constant $C \ge 0$ determined by the degree distribution. In particular, $C$ is the competing combination of two factors: (1) the contribution of atypically "thin" in-neighbourhoods, controlled by subcritical branching processes; and (2) the contribution of atypically "light" trajectories, controlled by large deviation rate functions. Additionally, our proof implies that whp the hitting and the cover time are both $n^{1+C+o(1)}$. Our results complement those of Caputo and Quattropani who showed that if the minimum in-degree is at least 2, stationary values have logarithmic fluctuations around $n^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representation via Axis-Aligned Point-Subspace Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new representation of $k$-partite, $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, a hypergraph with a partition of vertices into $k$ parts such that each hyperedge contains exactly one vertex of each type; we call them $k$-hypergraphs for short. Given positive integers $\ell, d$, and $k$ with $\ell\leq d-1$ and $k={d\choose\ell}$, any finite set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ represents a $k$-hypergraph $G_P$ as follows. Each point in $P$ is covered by $k$ many axis-aligned affine $\ell$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we call $\ell$-subspaces for brevity and which form the vertex set of $G_P$. We interpret each point in $P$ as a hyperedge of $G_P$ that contains each of the covering $\ell$-subspaces as a vertex. The class of \emph{$(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs} is the class of $k$-hypergraphs that can be represented in this way. The resulting classes of hypergraphs are fairly rich: Every $k$-hypergraph is a $(k,k-1)$-hypergraph. On the other hand, $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs form a proper subclass of the class of all $k$-hypergraphs for $\ell&lt;d-1$.
  In this paper we give a natural structural characterization of $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs based on vertex cuts. This characterization leads to a poly\-nomial-time recognition algorithm that decides for a given $k$-hypergraph whether or not it is a $(d,\ell)$-hypergraph and that computes a representation if existing. We assume that the dimension $d$ is constant and that the partitioning of the vertex set is prescribed.</description>

      <title>The degree-restricted random process is far from uniform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree-restricted random process is a natural algorithmic model for generating graphs with degree sequence D_n=(d_1, \ldots, d_n): starting with an empty n-vertex graph, it sequentially adds new random edges so that the degree of each vertex v_i remains at most d_i. Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.
  In this paper we show that, for degree sequences D_n that are not nearly regular, the final graph of the degree-restricted random process differs substantially from a uniform random graph with degree sequence D_n. The combinatorial proof technique is our main conceptual contribution: we adapt the switching method to the degree-restricted process, demonstrating that this enumeration technique can also be used to analyze stochastic processes (rather than just uniform random models, as before).</description>

      <title>Directed Capacity-Preserving Subgraphs: Hardness and Exact Polynomial Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and discuss the Minimum Capacity-Preserving Subgraph (MCPS) problem: given a directed graph and a retention ratio $\alpha \in (0,1)$, find the smallest subgraph that, for each pair of vertices $(u,v)$, preserves at least a fraction $\alpha$ of a maximum $u$-$v$-flow's value. This problem originates from the practical setting of reducing the power consumption in a computer network: it models turning off as many links as possible while retaining the ability to transmit at least $\alpha$ times the traffic compared to the original network.
  First we prove that MCPS is NP-hard already on a restricted set of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with unit edge capacities. Our reduction also shows that a closely related problem (which only considers the arguably most complicated core of the problem in the objective function) is NP-hard to approximate within a sublogarithmic factor already on DAGs. In terms of positive results, we present two algorithms that solve MCPS optimally on directed series-parallel graphs (DSPs): a simple linear-time algorithm for the special case of unit edge capacities and a cubic-time dynamic programming algorithm for the general case of non-uniform edge capacities. Further, we introduce the family of laminar series-parallel graphs (LSPs), a generalization of DSPs that also includes cyclic and very dense graphs. Their properties allow us to solve MCPS on LSPs by employing our DSP-algorithms as subroutines. In addition, we give a separate quadratic-time algorithm for MCPS on LSPs with unit edge capacities that also yields straightforward quadratic time algorithms for several related problems such as Minimum Equivalent Digraph and Directed Hamiltonian Cycle on LSPs.</description>
