      <title>Randomly measured quantum particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We show that a freely moving particle measured in this way undergoes superdiffusion, while a charged particle moving in a magnetic field confined to the lowest Landau level undergoes conventional diffusion. We also look at a particle moving in one dimensional space in a random time-independent potential, so that it is Anderson localized, which is also measured at random points in space and randomly in time. We find that random measurements break localization and this particle also undergoes diffusion. To address these questions, we develop formalism similar to that employed when studying classical and quantum problems with time-dependent noise.</description>

      <title>The Interconnection Tensor Rank and the Neural Network Storage Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network properties are considered in the case of the interconnection tensor rank being higher than two. This sort of interconnection tensor occurs in realization of crossbar-based neural networks. It is intrinsic for a crossbar design to suffer from parasitic currents. It is shown that the interconnection tensor of a certain form makes the neural network much more efficient: the storage capacity and basin of attraction of the network increase considerably. A network like the Hopfield one is used in the study.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09196v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Molecular Dynamics and TEM Analysis of Platinum Crystal Growth on Graphene and Reactive Hydrogen-Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pt-functionalized graphene harnesses graphene's exceptional carrier mobility with Pt's catalytic activity for hydrogen sensing, yet the mechanisms of Pt crystal growth, its interaction with graphene, and the consequent impact on hydrogen sensitivity remain incompletely understood. We develop a high-fidelity equivariant machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) to perform large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. Our simulations capture key growth stages-including Pt nucleation, coalescence, and the formation of either polycrystalline clusters or epitaxial thin films-under varying deposition loadings and rates. Transmission electron microscopy and Raman measurements validate the predicted morphologies, revealing small approximately spherical clusters at lower Pt loadings that evolve into slightly thicker, more planar domains with increased loading. Reactive MD shows hydrogen dissociates predominantly on Pt nanostructures at room temperature, with minimal spillover onto pristine graphene. Furthermore, hydrogen uptake increases with Pt loading at a diminishing rate, while reaction kinetics are significantly faster at lower coverages and rapidly decline with increasing loading. DFT calculations indicate undercoordinated Pt clusters induce $n$-type doping in graphene, which is diminished when hydrogen adsorption depletes Pt electron density, thereby transducing the adsorption events from Pt-surfaces to the Pt-graphene interface. By correlating deposition conditions, nanostructure morphology, and hydrogen sensing dynamics, our findings suggest that moderate Pt loadings can effectively balance sufficient doping with a pronounced Pt-mediated electronic response to graphene. These insights underscore the importance of combining DFT and MLIP simulations with experiments to guide next-generation chemiresistive gas sensor design.</description>

      <title>Improved Inference of Inverse Ising Problems under Missing Observations in Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are energy-based models analogous to the Ising model and are widely applied in statistical machine learning. The standard inverse Ising problem with a complete dataset requires computing both data and model expectations and is computationally challenging because model expectations have a combinatorial explosion. Furthermore, in many applications, the available datasets are partially incomplete, making it difficult to compute even data expectations. In this study, we propose a approximation framework for these expectations in the practical inverse Ising problems that integrates mean-field approximation or persistent contrastive divergence to generate refined initial points and spatial Monte Carlo integration to enhance estimator accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and accurately tunes the model parameters in comparison to the conventional method.</description>

      <title>Mass-Spring Models for Passive Keyword Spotting: A Springtronics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical systems played a foundational role in computing history, and have regained interest due to their unique properties, such as low damping and the ability to process mechanical signals without transduction. However, recent efforts have primarily focused on elementary computations, implemented in systems based on pre-defined reservoirs, or in periodic systems such as arrays of buckling beams. Here, we numerically demonstrate a passive mechanical system -- in the form of a nonlinear mass-spring model -- that tackles a real-world benchmark for keyword spotting in speech signals. The model is organized in a hierarchical architecture combining feature extraction and continuous-time convolution, with each individual stage tailored to the physics of the considered mass-spring systems. For each step in the computation, a subsystem is designed by combining a small set of low-order polynomial potentials. These potentials act as fundamental components that interconnect a network of masses. In analogy to electronic circuit design, where complex functional circuits are constructed by combining basic components into hierarchical designs, we refer to this framework as springtronics. We introduce springtronic systems with hundreds of degrees of freedom, achieving speech classification accuracy comparable to existing sub-mW electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Exact results for spin glass criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years scale invariant scattering theory provided the first exact access to the magnetic critical properties of two-dimensional statistical systems with quenched disorder. We show how the theory extends to the overlap variables entering the characterization of spin glass properties. The resulting exact fixed point equations yield both the magnetic and, for the first time, the spin glass renormalization group fixed points. For the case of the random bond Ising model, on which we focus, the spin glass subspace of solutions is found to contain a line of fixed points. We discuss the implications of the results for Ising spin glass criticality and compare with the available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The Mutual information has been broadly applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data, and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information in arbitrary orders in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single binss. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</description>

      <title>Dual-Space Invariance as a Definitive Signature of Critical States in Anderson Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical states represent a fundamental and fascinating research frontier in Anderson localization physics, known for their non-ergodic properties, including multifractal structure and self-similarity. However, exactly characterizing critical states continues to pose a significant challenge up to now. In this work, we establish a universal mechanism demonstrating that critical states must maintain dual-space invariance in both position and momentum representations, leading to delocalized dynamics in both spaces. Therefore, our discovery soundly answers this long-standing unsolved puzzle regarding the definition of the critical state and its rigorous characterization. Furthermore, keeping pace with the idea of Liu-Xia criterion, we prove rigorously that physical quantities being directly observed in experiments, such as the inverse participation ratio and information entropy, exhibit invariance in both position and momentum spaces as expected. Subsequent numerical simulations provide the smoking gun for the correctness of the dual-space invariance, thereby not only highlighting the universality of the rigorous mechanism, but also establishing a robust foundation for future experimental validation of critical states.</description>

      <title>Active and transfer learning with partially Bayesian neural networks for materials and chemicals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active learning, an iterative process of selecting the most informative data points for exploration, is crucial for efficient characterization of materials and chemicals property space. Neural networks excel at predicting these properties but lack the uncertainty quantification needed for active learning-driven exploration. Fully Bayesian neural networks, in which weights are treated as probability distributions inferred via advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, offer robust uncertainty quantification but at high computational cost. Here, we show that partially Bayesian neural networks (PBNNs), where only selected layers have probabilistic weights while others remain deterministic, can achieve accuracy and uncertainty estimates on active learning tasks comparable to fully Bayesian networks at lower computational cost. Furthermore, by initializing prior distributions with weights pre-trained on theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that PBNNs can effectively leverage computational predictions to accelerate active learning of experimental data. We validate these approaches on both molecular property prediction and materials science tasks, establishing PBNNs as a practical tool for active learning with limited, complex datasets.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect: Orbital Skew Scattering and Crossover Between Diffusive and Intrinsic Orbital Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent success of identifying experimental signatures of the orbital Hall effect (OHE), the research on the microscopic mechanisms behind this unique phenomenon is still in its infancy. Here, using a gapped 2D Dirac material as a model system of the OHE, we develop a microscopic theory of orbital transport which captures extrinsic disorder effects non-perturbatively. We show that it predicts several hitherto unknown effects, including (i) a strong dependence of the orbital Hall conductivity with the strength and symmetry of the impurity scattering potential, and (ii) a smooth crossover from intrinsic to extrinsic OHE as a function of the Fermi energy and impurity density. In contrast to previous (perturbative) studies, the OHE is found to exhibit bona fide diffusive behavior in the dilute impurity limit, which we trace back to the dominance of skew scattering-type processes. More generally, we argue that the newly unveiled orbital skew scattering mechanism governs the diffusive OHEs of a large class of 2D materials even when the crystal structure is inversion-symmetric. Our work unveils the crucial nature of non-perturbative vertex corrections for a complete description of orbital transport and confirms common short-range impurities as key enablers of the OHE.</description>

      <title>Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are the leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, the standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a generalized Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict, using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase in the presence of disorder, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P&gt;0.9998$) in classifying a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. We demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This is relevant since topology may not be uniquely defined by the scattering invariant in short disordered wires. This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.</description>
