      <title>Composition Operators on the Little Lipschitz space of a rooted tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the composition operators on the little Lipschitz space ${\mathcal L}_0$ of a rooted tree $T$ defined as the subspace of the Lipschitz space ${\mathcal L}$, introduced in Colonna and Easley [4], that consists of the complex-valued functions $f$ on $T$ such that $$ \lim_{|v|\to\infty}|f(v)-f(v^-)|=0, $$ where $v^-$ is the vertex adjacent to the vertex $v$ in the path from the root to $v$ and $|v|$ denotes the number of edges from the root to $v$. Specifically, we give several sufficient conditions on a Lipschitz self-map $\varphi$ on $T$ for which the composition operator $C_\varphi$ maps ${\mathcal L}_0$ into itself, and estimate its operator norm. In addition we study the spectrum of $C_\varphi$ and the hypercyclicity of a constant multiple of $C_\varphi$.</description>

      <title>Surjectivity of convolution operators on harmonic $NA$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a radial compactly supported distribution on a harmonic $NA$ group. We prove that the right convolution operator $c_{\mu}:f \mapsto f* \mu$ maps the space of smooth $\mathfrak{v}$-radial functions onto itself if and only if the spherical Fourier transform $\widetilde{\mu}(\lambda)$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, is slowly decreasing. As an application, we prove that certain averages over spheres are surjective on the space of smooth $\mathfrak{v}$-radial functions.</description>

      <title>A Complex Geometric Approach to the Discrete Gabor Transform and Localization Operators on the Flat Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the discrete Gabor transform was connected to a Gabor transform with a time frequency domain given by the flat torus. We show that the corresponding Bargmann spaces can be expressed as theta line bundles on Abelian varieties. We give applications of this viewpoint to frame results for the discrete Gabor transform. In particular, we get results which hold in higher dimension. We also give an application to asymptotics of restriction operators which arises from the asymptotic behavior of Bergman kernels for high tensor powers.</description>

      <title>Vector Fourier analysis on compact groups and Assiamoua spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows how a family of function spaces (coined as Assiamoua spaces) plays a fundamental role in the Fourier analysis of vector-valued functions compact groups. These spaces make it possible to transcribe the classic results of Fourier analysis in the framework of analysis of vector-valued functions and vector measures. The construction of Sobolev spaces of vector-valued functions on compact groups rests heavily on the members of the aforementioned family.</description>

      <title>Projections in L2 and L1 normed spaces and SVDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the essential properties of projections in the L2 and L1 normed spaces by two methods: Projection operators and by minimization of the distance. In Euclidean geometry the orthogonality (L2- conjugacy) plays central role; while in L1 normed space L1- conjugacy (the sign function) plays central role. Furthermore, this fact appears in the Pythagorean Theorem and its Taxicab analogue. We also compare three singular value decompositions: SVD, Taxicab SVD and L1min-SVD.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Sobolev functions via Besov-type energy functionals in fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of the ground-breaking result of Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu, we establish some characterizations of Sobolev functions in metric measure spaces including fractals like the Vicsek set, the Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket and the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. As corollaries of our characterizations, we present equivalent norms on the Korevaar--Schoen--Sobolev space, and show that the domain of a $p$-energy form is identified with a Besov-type function space under a suitable $(p,p)$-Poincar\'e inequality, capacity upper bound and the volume doubling property.</description>

      <title>G-strong subdifferentiability and applications to norm attaining subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reflexivity and strong subdifferentiability within the framework of group invariant mappings. We show that a Banach space is G-reflexive if the norm of its dual is G-strong subdifferentiable. To do this, we extend numerous classical concepts in functional analysis such as weak and weak-star topologies, the polar of a set, duality mapping, to the framework of group invariant mappings. We also extend many classical results in functional analysis including Banach-Alaoglu-Bourbaki's theorem, James' theorem, Moreau's maximum formula, and Krein-Smulian's theorem, to this context. To conclude, we provide an application of these new results by providing sufficient conditions to ensure the existence of closed Banach spaces inside the set of norm-attaining functionals of a Banach space.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the boundedness of periodic Fourier integral operators in Lebesgue spaces with variable exponent $L^{p(\cdot)}$ on the $n$-dimensional torus. We deal with operators of type $(\rho, \delta)$ which symbols belong to the H\"{o}rmander class $S^{m}_{\rho, \delta}(\mathbb{T}^{n}\times\mathbb{Z}^{n})$ for $0\leq\delta&lt;\rho\leq1.$</description>

      <title>Classification and dilation for $q$-commuting $2 \times 2$ scalar matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tuple $\underline{T}=(T_1, \dotsc, T_k)$ of operators on a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ is said to be \textit{$q$-commuting with} $\|q\|=1$ or simply $q$-\textit{commuting} if there is a family of scalars $q=\{q_{ij} \in \mathbb C : |q_{ij}|=1, \ q_{ij}=q_{ji}^{-1}, \ 1 \leq i &lt; j \leq k \}$ such that $T_i T_j =q_{ij}T_j T_i$ for $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq k$. Moreover, if each $q_{ij}=-1$, then $\underline{T}$ is called an \textit{anti-commuting tuple}. A well-known result due to Holbrook \cite{Holbrook} states that a commuting $k$-tuple consisting of $2 \times 2$ scalar matrix contractions always dilates to a commuting $k$-tuple of unitaries for any $k\geq 1$. To find a generalization of this result for a $q$-commuting $k$-tuple of $2\times 2$ scalar matrix contractions, we first classify such tuples into three types upto similarity. Then we prove that a $q$-commuting tuple which is unitarily equivalent to any of these three types, admits a $\widetilde{q}$-unitary dilation, where $\widetilde q \subseteq q \cup \{1\}$. A special emphasis is given to the dilation of an anti-commuting tuple of $2 \times 2$ scalar matrix contractions.</description>

      <title>Extreme Points of Spectrahedrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of characterizing extreme points of the convex set of positive linear operators on a possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space under linear constraints. We show that even perturbations of points in such sets admit what resembles a Douglas factorization. Using this result, we prove that an operator is extreme iff a corresponding set of linear operators is dense in the space of trace-class self-adjoint operators with range contained in the closure of the range of that operator. If the number of constraints is finite, we show that the extreme point must be of low-rank relative to the number of constraints and derive a purely rank-based characterization of the extreme points.
  In the finite-dimensional setting, our results lead to a remarkably simple characterization of the elliptope, that is, the set of correlation matrices, in terms of the Hadamard product which allows us to characterize the set of matrices which constitute the equality case of the Hadamard rank inequality when the involved matrices are equal and positive semi-definite. We illustrate the importance of our results using examples from statistics and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of product systems of Hilbert spaces derived from Banach space-valued L\'evy processes. We establish conditions under which these product systems are completely spatial and show that Gaussian L\'evy processes with non-degenerate covariance always give rise to product systems of type I. Furthermore, we construct a continuum of non-isomorphic product systems of type \(\rm{II}\sb\infty\) from pure jump L\'evy processes.</description>

      <title>Discarding Lavrentiev's Gap in Non-automonous and Non-Convex Variational Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14995v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that the Lavrentiev gap between Sobolev and Lipschitz maps does not occur for a scalar variational problem of the form: \[ \textrm{to minimize} \qquad u \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\text{d}x \,, \] under a Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz open set in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 1$ and the function $f$ is required to be measurable with respect to the spacial variable, continuous with respect to the second one, and continuous and comparable to convex with respect to the last variable. Moreover, we assume that $f$ satisfies a natural condition balancing the variations with respect to the first variable and the growth with respect to the last one. Remarkably, typical conditions that are usually imposed on $f$ to discard the Lavrentiev gap are dropped here: we do not require $f$ to be bounded or convex with respect to the second variable, nor impose any condition of $\Delta_2$-kind with respect to the last variable.</description>

      <title>Radii of Euclidean sections of $\ell_p$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Dvoretzky theorem asserts that every $N$-dimensional convex body admits central sections of dimension $d = \Omega(\log N)$, which is nearly spherical. For many instances of convex bodies, typically unit balls with respect to some norm, much better lower bounds on $d$ have been obtained, with most research focusing on such lower bounds and on the degree of approximation of the section by a $k$-dimensional Euclidean ball. In this note we focus on another parameter, namely the radius of the approximating ball. We focus on the case of the unit ball of the space $\ell_1^N$ (the so-called cross-polytope), which is relevant to various questions of interest in theoretical computer science. We will also survey other instances where similar questions for other normed spaces (most often $\ell_p$-spaces or their non-commutative analogues) were found relevant to problems in various areas of mathematics and its applications, and state some open problems. Finally, in view of the computer science ramifications, we will comment on the algorithmic aspects of finding nearly spherical sections.</description>

      <title>Deformations of nearby subgroups and approximate Jordan constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{U}$ be a Banach Lie group and $S\subseteq \mathbb{U}$ an ad-bounded subset thereof, in the sense that there is a uniform bound on the adjoint operators induced by elements of $S$ on the Lie algebra of $\mathbb{U}$. We prove that (1) $S$-valued continuous maps from compact groups to $\mathbb{U}$ sufficiently close to being morphisms are uniformly close to morphisms; and (2) for any Lie subgroup $\mathbb{G}\le \mathbb{U}$ there is an identity neighborhood $U\ni 1\in \mathbb{U}$ so that $\mathbb{G}\cdot U\cap S$-valued morphisms (embeddings) from compact groups into $\mathbb{U}$ are close to morphisms (respectively embeddings) into $\mathbb{G}$.
  This recovers and generalizes results of Turing's to the effect that (a) Lie groups arbitrarily approximable by finite subgroups have abelian identity component and (b) if a Lie group is approximable in this fashion and has a faithful $d$-dimensional representation then it is also so approximable by finite groups with the same property. Another consequence is a strengthening of a prior result stating that finite subgroups in a Banach Lie group sufficiently close to a given compact subgroup thereof admit a finite upper bound on the smallest indices of their normal abelian subgroups (an approximate version of Jordan's theorem on finite subgroups of linear groups).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that van Suijlekom's technique of imposing a set of conditions on operator system spectral triples ensures Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of sequences of sets of unital completely positive maps (equipped with the BW-topology which is metrizable). This implies that even when only a part of the spectrum of the Dirac operator is available together with a certain truncation of the $C^*$-algebra, information about the geometry can be extracted.</description>

Abstract: We establish a direct log-epiperimetric inequality for Yang--Mills fields in arbitrary dimension and we leverage on it to prove uniqueness of tangent cones with isolated singularity for energy minimizing Yang--Mills fields and $\omega$-ASD connections (where $\omega$ is not necessarily closed) satisfying some suitable regularity assumptions. En route to this we establish a Luckhaus type lemma for Yang--Mills connections to exclude curvature concentration along blow-up sequences.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharp defective log-Sobolev inequality on H-type groups. Then we use such an inequality to show exponential integrability of Lipschitz functions with respect to the heat kernel measure. A defective log-Sobolev-type inequality for the Gaussian-like measure with respect to the sub-Riemannian distance is also proved on arbitrary H-type groups.</description>

      <title>Restricted weighted weak boundedness for product type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a bilinear (or sub-bilinear) operator $B$, we prove restricted weighted weak type inequalities of the form $$ ||B(f_1, f_2)||_{L^{p, \infty}(w_1^{p/p_1}w_2^{p/p_2})}\lesssim ||f_1||_{L^{p_1, 1}(w_1)}||f_2||_{L^{p_2, 1}(w_2)}, $$ whenever $B(f_1, f_2)= (T_1f_1) (T_2 f_2)$ is the product of two singular integral operators satisfying Dini conditions. Additionally, we also establish, as an application, the boundedness of a certain class of bounded variation bilinear Fourier multipliers solving a question posted in [Bilinear Fourier multipliers of bounded variation; Int. Math. Res. Not. (2023), no.24, 21943--21975 by Baena-Miret, Carro, Luque and Sanchez-Pascuala].</description>

      <title>The essential m-dissipativity for degenerate infinite dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a degenerate infinite dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian system with multiplicative noise and establish the essential m-dissipativity on $L^2(\mu^{\Phi})$ of the corresponding Kolmogorov (backwards) operator. Here, $\Phi$ is the potential and $\mu^{\Phi}$ the invariant measure with density $e^{-\Phi}$ with respect to an infinite dimensional non-degenerate Gaussian measure. The main difficulty, besides the non-sectorality of the Kolmogorov operator, is the coverage of a large class of potentials. We include potentials that have neither a bounded nor a Lipschitz continuous gradient. The essential m-dissipativity is the starting point to establish the hypocoercivity of the strongly continuous contraction semigroup $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ generated by the Kolmogorov operator. By using the refined abstract Hilbert space hypocoercivity method of Grothaus and Stilgenbauer, originally introduced by Dolbeault, Mouhot and Schmeiser, we construct a $\mu^{\Phi}$-invariant Hunt process with weakly continuous paths and infinite lifetime, whose transition semigroup is associated with $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$. This process provides a stochastically and analytically weak solution to the degenerate infinite dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian system with multiplicative noise. The hypocoercivity of $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ and the identification of $(T_t)_{t\geq 0}$ with the transition semigroup of the process leads to the exponential ergodicity. Finally, we apply our results to degenerate second order in time stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with multiplicative noise. A discussion of the class of applicable potentials and coefficients governing these equations completes our analysis.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic functions on the quantum polydisk and on the quantum ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:1508.05768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study noncommutative (or ``quantized'') versions of the algebras of holomorphic functions on the polydisk and on the ball in $\mathbb C^n$. Specifically, for each $q\in\mathbb C\setminus\{ 0\}$ we construct Fr\'echet algebras $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb D^n)$ and $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb B^n)$ such that for $q=1$ they are isomorphic to the algebras of holomorphic functions on the open polydisk $\mathbb D^n$ and on the open ball $\mathbb B^n$, respectively. In the case where $0&lt;q&lt;1$, we establish a relation between our holomorphic quantum ball algebra $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb B^n)$ and L. L. Vaksman's algebra $C_q(\bar{\mathbb B}^n)$ of continuous functions on the closed quantum ball. Finally, we show that $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb D^n)$ and $\mathcal O_q(\mathbb B^n)$ are not isomorphic provided that $|q|=1$ and $n\ge 2$. This result can be interpreted as a $q$-analog of Poincar\'e's theorem, which asserts that $\mathbb D^n$ and $\mathbb B^n$ are not biholomorphically equivalent unless $n=1$.

      <title>Ces\`aro operators associated with Borel measures acting on weighted spaces of holomorphic functions with sup-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive finite Borel measure on $[0,1).$ Ces\`aro-type operators $C_{\mu}$ when acting on weighted spaces of holomorphic functions are investigated. In the case of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc we prove that $C_\mu$ is continuous if and only if it is compact. In the case of weighted Banach spaces of holomorphic function defined by general weights, we give sufficient and necessary conditions for the continuity and compactness. For standard weights, we characterize the continuity and compactness on classical growth Banach spaces of holomorphic functions. We also study the point spectrum and the spectrum of $C_\mu$ on the space of holomorphic functions on the disc, on the space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disc, and on the classical growth Banach spaces of holomorphic functions. All characterizations are given in terms of the sequence of moments $(\mu_n)_{n\in\N_0}$. The continuity, compactness and spectrum of $C_\mu$ acting on Fr\'echet and (LB) Korenblum type spaces are also considered.</description>

Abstract: Recent results concerning the linear dynamics and mean ergodicity of compact operators in Banach spaces, together with additional new results, are employed to investigate various spectral properties of generalized Ces\`aro operators acting in large classes of classical BK-sequence spaces. Of particular interest is to determine the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of such operators and to decide whether (or not) the operators are power bounded, mean ergodic and supercyclic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the inherent structural properties of Krylov subspaces, in particular for the self-adjoint class of operators, and how they relate with the important phenomenon of `Krylov solvability' of linear inverse problems. Owing to the complexity of the problem in the unbounded setting, recently developed perturbative techniques are used that exploit the use of the weak topology on $\mathcal{H}$. We also make a strong connection between the approximation properties of the Krylov subspace and the famous Hamburger problem of moments, in particular the determinacy condition.</description>

Abstract: We establish inverse and direct theorems on best approximations in quasi-normed Abelian groups through bilateral Bernstein-Jackson inequalities with exact constants. Using integral representations for quasi-norms of functions $f$ in Lebesgue's spaces by decreasing rearrangements $f^*$ with the help of approximation $E$-functionals, error estimates are found. Examples of numerical calculations and spectral approximations of self-adjoint operators obtained by obtained estimates are given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work about band projections on spaces of regular operators over a Banach lattice, given a Banach lattice algebra $A$, we will say an element $a \in A_+$ is a band projection if the multiplication operator $L_aR_a\in \mathcal L_r(A)$ is a band projection. Our aim in this note is to explore the relations between this and the notion of order idempotent (those elements $a$ in a Banach lattice algebra $A$ with identity $e$ such that $0\leq a\leq e$ and $a^2=a$). We also revisit the properties of the ideal generated by the identity on a Banach lattice algebra, motivated by those of the centre of a Banach lattice.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Grand Wiener Amalgam Spaces and the boundedness of Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \cite{g5}, we defined and investigated the grand Wiener amalgam space $W(L^{p),\theta_1}(\Omega), L^{q),\theta_2}(\Omega))$ , where $1&lt;p,q&lt;\infty, \theta_1&gt;0, \theta_2&gt;0$, $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^{n} $ and the Lebesgue measure of $\Omega$ is finite. In the present paper we generalize this space and define the generalized grand Wiener amalgam space $W(L_{a}^{p)}(\mathbb R^{n}), L_{b}^{q)}(\mathbb R^{n})),$ where $L_{a}^{p)}(\mathbb R^{n})$ and $L_{b}^{q)}(\mathbb R^{n}),$ are the generalized grand Lebesgue spaces, (see \cite{u}, \cite{su3}). Later we investigate some basic properties. Next we study embeddings for these spaces and we discuss boundedness and unboundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator between some generalized grand Wiener amalgam spaces.</description>

      <title>Excess of Fusion Frames: A Comprehensive Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the excess as a method of measuring the redundancy of frames was recently introduced to address certain issues in frame theory. In this paper, the concept of excess for fusion frames is studied. Then, several explicit methods are provided to compute the excess of fusion frames and their $Q$-duals. In particular, some upper bounds for the excess of $Q$-dual fusion frames are established. It turns out that, unlike ordinary frames, for every $n \in \Bbb{N}$ we can provide a fusion frame with its $Q$-dual whose the difference of their excess is $n$. Furthermore, the connection between the excess of fusion frames and their orthogonal complement is completely characterized. Finally, several examples are exhibited to confirm the obtained results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the relationship of symmetric operators with Hermitian symmetric spaces, we introduce the notion of \emph{Weyl curve} for a symmetric operator $T$, which is the geometric abstraction and generalization of the well-known Weyl functions. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between unitary equivalence classes of simple symmetric operators and congruence classes of Nevanlinna curves (the geometric analogue of operator-valued Nevanlinna functions). To prove this result, we introduce a \emph{canonical} functional model for $T$ in terms of its \emph{characteristic vector bundles}. In this geometric formalism, when the deficiency indices are $(n,n)$ ($n\leq +\infty$) we also introduce the notion of \emph{entire operators}, whose Weyl curves are entire in the Grassmannian $Gr(n,2n)$. If $n$ is finite, this makes it possible to introduce modern value distribution theory of entire curves into the picture and to demonstrate that the distribution of eigenvalues of a \emph{generic} abstract boundary value problem is the same thing as the value distribution of the Weyl curve with respect to the Cartier divisor induced by the corresponding boundary condition. Many other new concepts are introduced and many new results are obtained as well.</description>

      <title>On the limiting Horn inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Horn inequalities characterise the possible spectra of triples of $n$-by-$n$ Hermitian matrices $A+B=C$. We study integral inequalities that arise as limits of Horn inequalities as $n \to \infty$. These inequalities are parametrised by the points of an infinite-dimensional convex body, the asymptotic Horn system $\mathscr{H}$, which can be regarded as a topological closure of the countable set of Horn inequalities for all finite $n$.
  We prove three main results. The first shows that arbitrary points of $\mathscr{H}$ can be well approximated by specific sets of finite-dimensional Horn inequalities. The second is a quantitative result on the redundancy of the Horn inequalities in an infinite-dimensional setting. Concretely, the Horn inequalities for finite $n$ are indexed by certain sets $T^n_r$ with $1 \le r \le n-1$; we show that if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ and $(r_k)_{k \ge 1}$ are any sequences such that $(r_k / n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a dense subset of $(0,1)$, then the Horn inequalities indexed by the sets $T^{n_k}_{r_k}$ are sufficient to imply all of the others.
  Our third main result shows that $\mathscr{H}$ has a remarkable self-characterisation property. Namely, membership in $\mathscr{H}$ is determined by the very inequalities corresponding to the points of $\mathscr{H}$ itself. To illuminate this phenomenon, we sketch a general theory of sets that characterise themselves in the sense that they parametrise their own membership criteria, and we consider the question of what further information would be needed in order for this self-characterisation property to determine the Horn inequalities uniquely.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Molecular Dynamics Optimization: A Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize molecular dynamics by focusing on the entire trajectory rather than just the final molecular configuration. Leveraging a stochastic version of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, our framework effectively explores non-convex molecular energy landscapes, escaping local minima to stabilize in low-energy states. Our approach operates in continuous state and action spaces without relying on labeled data, making it applicable to a wide range of molecular systems. Through extensive experimentation on six distinct molecules, including Bradykinin and Oxytocin, we demonstrate competitive performance against other unsupervised physics-based methods, such as the Greedy and NEMO-based algorithms. Our method's adaptability and focus on dynamic trajectory optimization make it suitable for applications in areas such as drug discovery and molecular design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show several variants of concentration inequalities on the sphere stated as subgaussian estimates with optimal constants. For a Lipschitz function, we give one-sided and two-sided bounds for deviation from the median as well as from the mean. For example, we show that if $\mu$ is the normalized surface measure on $S^{n-1}$ with $n\geq 3$, $f : S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$ is $1$-Lipschitz, $M$ is the median of $f$, and $t &gt;0$, then $\mu\big(f \geq M +t\big) \leq \frac 12 e^{-nt^2/2}$. If $M$ is the mean of $f$, we have a two-sided bound $\mu\big(|f - M| \geq t\big) \leq e^{-nt^2/2}$. Consequently, if $\gamma$ is the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f : \mathbb{R}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ (again, $1$-Lipschitz, with the mean equal to $M$), then $\gamma \big(|f - M| \geq t\big) \leq e^{-t^2/2}$. These bounds are slightly better and arguably more elegant than those available elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic dynamics on amenable groups and van der Corput sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Bergelson and Lesigne by showing that the notion of van der Corput set does not depend on the F\o lner sequence used to define it. This result has been discovered independently by Sa\'ul Rodr\'iguez Mart\'in. Both ours and Rodr\'iguez's proofs proceed by first establishing a converse to the Furstenberg Correspondence Principle for amenable groups.
  This involves studying the distributions of Reiter sequences over congruent sequences of tilings of the group.
  Lastly, we show that many of the equivalent characterizations of van der Corput sets in $\mathbb{N}$ that do not involve F\o lner sequences remain equivalent for arbitrary countably infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Generic continuity of the perturbed minima of certain parametric optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in a quite general framework, the parameterized optimization problem can be so perturbed as to be generically well-posed. As an application, we provide a contribution to Stechkin theory.</description>
