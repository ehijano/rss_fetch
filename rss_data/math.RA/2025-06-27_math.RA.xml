      <title>On the PI-exponent of matrix algebras and algebras with generalized actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the PI-exponent of the matrix ring with coefficients in an associative algebra. As a consequence, we prove the following. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a PI-algebra with a positive PI-exponent. If $M_n(\mathcal{R})$ and $M_m(\mathcal{R})$ satisfy the same set of polynomial identities then $n=m$. We provide examples where this result fails if either $\mathcal{R}$ is not PI or has zero exponent. We obtain the same statement for certain finite-dimensional algebras with generalized action over an algebraically closed field of zero characteristic.</description>

      <title>Conjugate L-Subgroups of an L-group and their Applications to Normality and Normalizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the notion of the conjugate of an L-subgroup by an L-point has been introduced. Then, several properties of conjugate L-subgroups have been studied analogous to their group-theoretic counterparts. Also, the notion of conjugacy has been investigated in the context of normality of L-subgroups. Furthermore, some important relationships between conjugate L-subgroups and normalizer have also been established. Finally, the normalizer of an L-subgroup of an L-group has been defined by using the notion of conjugate L-subgroups.</description>

      <title>On a minimal free resolution of the residue field over a local ring of codepth 3 of class T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be any local ring with residue field $k$, and $A$ the homology of the Koszul complex on a minimal set of generators of the maximal ideal of $R$. In this paper, we show that a minimal free resolution of $k$ over $R$ can be obtained from a graded minimal free resolution of $k$ over $A$. More precisely, this is done by the iterated mapping cone construction, introduced by the authors in a previous work, using specific choices of ingredients. As applications, using this general perspective, we exhibit a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a complete intersection ring of any codepth, and explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of $k$ over a local ring of codepth 3 of class $T$ in terms of Koszul blocks.</description>

      <title>Classical Yang-Baxter equations and Nijenhuis operators for Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the conditions that when a Lie algebra is Nijenhuis are investigated. Furthermore all the Nijenhuis operators on $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ under the standard Cartan-Weyl basis are given. On the other hand, the notion of classical $P$-Nijenhuis Yang-Baxter equations is introduced by means of the bialgebraic theory for Nijenhuis Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Anti-pre-Novikov algebras, quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firstly, we introduce a notion of anti-pre-Novikov algebras as a new framework for decomposing Novikov algebras. Anti-O-operators on Novikov algebras are developed to provide an algebraic framework for constructing anti-pre-Novikov algebras. Secondly, we introduce a notion of anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as the bialgebra structures corresponding to a double construction of symmetric quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras, which is characterized by certain matched pairs of Novikov algebras as well as the compatible anti-pre-Novikov algebras. The study of the coboundary case induces the anti-pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation (APN-YBE), whose skew-symmetric solutions yield coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The notion of O-operators on anti-pre-Novikov algebras is studied to construct skew-symmetric solutions of the APN-YBE. Thirdly, we investigate quasi-triangular and factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras as a special class of coboundary anti-pre-Novikov bialgebras. The solutions of the APN-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant give rise to a quasi-triangular anti-pre-Novikov bialgebra. Moreover, relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights are introduced to demonstrate solutions of the APN-YBE whose symmetric parts are invariant. Finally, we introduce a notion of quadratic Rota-Baxter anti-pre-Novikov algebras, which is one to one correspondence to a factorizable anti-pre-Novikov bialgebra.</description>

      <title>The Graded Classification Conjecture holds for graphs with disjoint cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Graded Classification Conjecture (GCC) states that the pointed $K_0^{\operatorname{gr}}$-group is a complete invariant of the Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs when these algebras are considered with their natural grading by $\mathbb Z.$ The conjecture has previously been shown to hold in some special cases. The main result of the paper shows that the GCC holds for a significantly more general class of graphs included in the class of graphs with disjoint cycles. In particular, our result holds for finite graphs with disjoint cycles. We show the main result also for graph $C^*$-algebras. As a consequence, the graded version of the Isomorphism Conjecture holds for the class of graphs we consider.
  Besides showing the conjecture for the class of graphs we consider, we realize the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-group isomorphism by a specific graded $*$-isomorphism. In particular, we introduce a series of graph operations which preserve the graded $*$-isomorphism class of their algebras. After performing these operations on a graph, we obtain well-behaved ``representative'' graphs, which we call canonical forms. We define an equivalence $\approx$ on graphs such that $E\approx F$ holds when there are isomorphic canonical forms of $E$ and $F$ and we show that the condition $E\approx F$ is equivalent to the existence of an isomorphism $f$ of the Grothendieck $\mathbb Z$-groups of the algebras of $E$ and $F$ in the appropriate category. As $E\approx F$ can be realized by a finite series of specific graph operations, any such isomorphism $f$ can be realized by an explicit graded $*$-algebra isomorphism. Thus, we describe the graded ($*$-)isomorphism classes of the algebras of graphs we consider. Besides the ties to symbolic dynamics and Williams' Problem, such a description is relevant for the active program of classification of graph $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every $n$-tuple in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ has a first non-zero entry and a last non-zero entry. What do the positions of such entries in the elements of a subspace W of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ reveal about W? It turns out, a great deal! This insight offers a beeline to the fundamental results on general bases and dimension (including dimensions of complements, rank of a transpose, Rank-Nullity Theorem, Full Rank Factorization, and existence/uniqueness of RREF), bypassing some of the traditional stumbling blocks and time sinks.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>Minimal generating sets of large powers of bivariate monomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a monomial ideal $I$, it is known that for increasing $n$ the number of minimal generators $\mu(I^n)$ eventually follows a polynomial pattern. In general, little is known about the power at which this pattern emerges. Even less is known about the exact form of the minimal generators after this power. We show that for sufficiently large $s\in\mathbb{N}$, every higher power $I^{s+\ell}$ can be constructed from certain subideals of $I^s$. We further show that such an $s$ can be chosen to satisfy $s\le\mu(I)(d^2-1)+1$, where $d$ is a constant bounded above by the maximal $x$- or $y$-degree appearing in the set $\mathsf{G}(I)$ of minimal generators of $I$. This provides an explicit description of $\mathsf{G}(I^n)$ in terms of $\mathsf{G}(I^s)$, significantlyreducing computational complexity in determining high powers of bivariate monomial ideals. This further enables us to explicitly compute $\mu(I^n)$ for all $n\ge s$ in terms of a linear polynomial in $n$. We include runtime measurements for the attached implementation in SageMath.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (Co)homology of D-modules on rigid analytic spaces I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism of Hochschild (co)-homology for $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules on smooth rigid analytic spaces based on the homological tools of Ind-Banach $\mathcal{D}$-cap modules. We introduce several categories of $\mathcal{D}$-cap bimodules for which this theory is well-behaved. Among these, the most important example is the category of diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes. We give an explicit calculation of the Hochschild complex for diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complexes, and show that the Hochschild complex of $\mathcal{D}$-cap is canonically isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. In particular, we obtain a Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence converging to the Hochschild cohomology groups of $\mathcal{D}$-cap. We obtain explicit formulas relating the Hochschild cohomology and homology of a given diagonal $\mathcal{C}$-complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth $p$-adic Stein space with free tangent sheaf. We use the notion of Hochschild cohomology for sheaves of Ind-Banach algebras developed in our previous work to study the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra of infinite order differential operators $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap. In particular, we show that the Hochschild cohomology complex of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap is a strict complex of nuclear Fr\'echet spaces which is quasi-isomorphic to the de Rham complex of $X$. We then use this to compare the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with a wide array of Ext functors. Finally, we investigate the relation of the Hochschild cohomology of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap with the deformation theory of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap. Assuming some finiteness conditions on the de Rham cohomology of $X$, we define explicit isomorphisms between the first Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of bounded outer derivations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap, and between the second Hochschild cohomology group of $\mathcal{D}_X$-cap and the space of infinitesimal deformations of $\mathcal{D}_X(X)$-cap.</description>
