      <title>General two-component long-wave short-wave resonance interaction system: Non-degenerate vector solitons and their collision dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the emergence of non-degenerate bright solitons and summarize their several interesting features in a completely integrable two-component long-wave-short-wave resonance interaction model with a general form of nonlinearity coefficients. Through the classical Hirota's bilinear method, we obtain a fully non-degenerate $N$-soliton solution in Gram determinant form for this LSRI model. Depending on the choice of velocity conditions, the obtained non-degenerate fundamental soliton is classified into two types, namely ($1,1,1$)- and ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate one solitons. We then show that the basic ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate soliton exhibits novel profile structures, including a double-hump, a special flat-top, and a conventional single-hump profile, and ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate soliton admits two-soliton like oblique collision, a behavior akin to KP line soliton interaction with a short stem structure. A detailed asymptotic analysis is carried out to study the long time behavior of ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate solitons and it reveals that they undergo both shape-preserving and shape-changing collisions. However, our analysis confirms that the shape changing collision between these solitons become elastic in nature after appropriate shift of time coordinates. Further, we identified that the ($1,1,2$)-non-degenerate solitons also undergo elastic collision. In addition, we have also investigated the formation or suppression of breathing phenomena during collision between a degenerate soliton and a ($1,1,1$)-non-degenerate soliton. For completeness, we also point out the collision scenario between the completely degenerate solitons. The results presented in this paper are broadly applicable to Bose-Einstein condensates, nonlinear optics, plasma physics, and other closely related fields.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of soliton gas primitive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a class of soliton gas primitive potentials for the Korteweg--de Vries equation that arise from the accumulation of solitons on an infinite interval in the physical domain, extending to $-\infty$. This accumulation results in an associated Riemann--Hilbert problem on a number of disjoint intervals. In the case where the jump matrices have specific square-root behavior, we describe an efficient and accurate numerical method to solve this Riemann--Hilbert problem and extract the potential. The keys to the method are, first, the deformation of the Riemann--Hilbert problem, making numerical use of the so-called $g$-function, and, second, the incorporation of endpoint singularities into the chosen basis to discretize and solve the associated singular integral equation.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Evolution of a Dense Ensemble of Optically Pumped Excitons to a Charge Transfer State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses are mainstream in studies on the dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as in, e.g., organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground state ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt, for the phase transition, a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor that appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state that then evolves, while interacting with other degrees of freedom which are prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density, which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains that evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</description>
