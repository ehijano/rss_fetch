      <title>Generalized Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg-Nash null controllability for stochastic parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a hierarchical control problem for stochastic parabolic equations involving gradient terms. We employ the Stackelberg-Nash strategy with two leaders and two followers. The leaders are responsible for selecting the policy targeting null controllability, while the followers solve a bi-objective optimal control problem which consists of maintaining the solution process close to prefixed targets. Once the Nash equilibrium is determined, the problem reduces to achieving null controllability of a coupled forward-backward stochastic system. To solve this problem, via Carleman estimates, we establish a suitable observability inequality. Subsequently, we achieve the desired controllability result.</description>

      <title>Mixed Newton Method for Optimization in Complex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we modify and apply the recently introduced Mixed Newton Method, which is originally designed for minimizing real-valued functions of complex variables, to the minimization of real-valued functions of real variables by extending the functions to complex space. We show that arbitrary regularizations preserve the favorable local convergence properties of the method, and construct a special type of regularization used to prevent convergence to complex minima. We compare several variants of the method applied to training neural networks with real and complex parameters.</description>

      <title>English version of "Screen-line counter location problem with O/D cut selection approach"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an efficient solution approach to the screen-line counter location problem (SCLP), which is a counter location problem with the constraint that the traffic between OD pairs must be observed at least once. This paper formulates the SCLP using a graph cut approach, which consists of an enumeration of cuts and a cut selection problem. These problems can be reduced to a concise formulation that extends the maximum weight closure problem for two problems: finding the minimum number of links that observe all OD pairs and finding the maximum number of observed OD pairs with a budget-constrained number of links. Insights into the characteristics of cuts give superior upper bounds on the problem of finding the minimum number of links that observe all OD pairs. The proposed method is evaluated on the Sioux-Falls network. It shows that it is possible to derive a solution equivalent to the optimal solution found in previous studies in a very short computation time.</description>

      <title>Accelerated forward-backward and Douglas-Rachford splitting dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of continuous-time variants of accelerated Forward-Backward (FB) and Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting algorithms for nonsmooth composite optimization problems. When the objective function is given by the sum of a quadratic and a nonsmooth term, we establish accelerated sublinear and exponential convergence rates for convex and strongly convex problems, respectively. Moreover, for FB splitting dynamics, we demonstrate that accelerated exponential convergence rate carries over to general strongly convex problems. In our Lyapunov-based analysis we exploit the variable-metric gradient interpretations of FB and DR splittings to obtain smooth Lyapunov functions that allow us to establish accelerated convergence rates. We provide computational experiments to demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Static and dynamic SABR stochastic volatility models: calibration and option pricing using GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the calibration of the parameters in static and dynamic SABR stochastic volatility models, we propose the application of the GPU technology to the Simulated Annealing global optimization algorithm and to the Monte Carlo simulation. This calibration has been performed for EURO STOXX 50 index and EUR/USD exchange rate with an asymptotic formula for volatility or Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, in the dynamic model we propose an original more general expression for the functional parameters, specially well suited for the EUR/USD exchange rate case. Numerical results illustrate the expected behavior of both SABR models and the accuracy of the calibration. In terms of computational time, when the asymptotic formula for volatility is used the speedup with respect to CPU computation is around $200$ with one GPU. Furthermore, GPU technology allows the use of Monte Carlo simulation for calibration purposes, the computational time with CPU being prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Generalized replicator dynamics based on mean-field pairwise comparison dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairwise comparison dynamic is a forward ordinary differential equation in a Banach space whose solution is a time-dependent probability measure to maximize utility based on a nonlinear and nonlocal protocol. It contains a wide class of evolutionary game models, such as replicator dynamics and its generalization. We present an inverse control approach to obtain a replicator-type pairwise comparison dynamic from the large discount limit of a mean field game (MFG) as a coupled forward-backward system. This methodology provides a new interpretation of replicator-type dynamics as a myopic perception limit of the dynamic programming. The cost function in the MFG is explicitly obtained to derive the generalized replicator dynamics. We present a finite difference method to compute these models such that the conservation and nonnegativity of the probability density and bounds of the value function can be numerically satisfied. We conduct a computational convergence study of a large discount limit, focusing on potential games and an energy management problem under several conditions.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Boost the Vehicle-2-Grid Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) are emerging as battery energy storage systems (BESSs) of increasing importance for different power grid services. However, the unique characteristics of EVs makes them more difficult to operate than dedicated BESSs. In this work, we apply a data-driven learning approach to leverage EVs as a BESS to provide capacity-related services to the grid. The approach uses machine learning to predict how to charge and discharge EVs while satisfying their operational constraints. As a paradigm application, we use flexible energy commercialization in the wholesale markets, but the approach can be applied to a broader range of capacity-related grid services. We evaluate the proposed approach numerically and show that when the number of EVs is large, we can obtain comparable objective values to CPLEX and approximate dynamic programming, but with shorter run times. These reduced run times are important because they allow us to (re)optimize frequently to adapt to the time-varying system conditions.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Extremum Seeking Control for Dynamic Maps through Sliding Modes and Periodic Switching Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of an extremum seeking controller based on sliding modes and cyclic search for real-time optimization of non-linear multivariable dynamic systems. These systems have arbitrary relative degree, compensated by the technique of time-scaling. The resulting approach guarantees global convergence of the system output to a small neighborhood of the optimum point. To corroborate with the theoretical results, numerical simulations are presented considering a system with two inputs and one output, which rapidly converges to the optimal parameters of the objective function.</description>

      <title>A time adaptive optimal control approach for 4D-var data assimilation problems governed by parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We interpret the 4D-var data assimilation problem for a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in the context of optimal control and revisit the process of deriving optimality conditions for an initial control problem. This is followed by a reformulation of the optimality conditions into an elliptic PDE, which is only dependent on the adjoint state and can therefore be solved directly without the need for e.g. gradient methods or related iterative procedures. Furthermore, we derive an a-posteriori error estimation for this system as well as its initial condition. We utilize this estimate to formulate a procedure for the creation of an adaptive grid in time for the adjoint state. This is used for 4D-var data assimilation in order to identify suitable time points to take measurements.</description>

      <title>Explicit solution to an optimal two-player switching game in infinite horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a problem in which two decision makers have each, a set of possible decisions they can make at each time. Each decision implies a given random payoff. We choose the payoff to be a functional of a one-dimensional It\^o diffusion. At each time, they can switch from a decision to another, and switching incurs a cost. The first decision maker's objective is to select a sequence of switching times that maximizes the associated expected discounted payoff flow, while the second decision maker's objective is to select a sequence of switching times that minimizes the associated expected discounted payoff flow. The strategies of both decision makers are interconnected in the sense that the random payoff flow of one of the decision makers depends on the strategy of the other decision maker. We characterize the switching regions which reduce the switching problem into one of finding a finite number of threshold values in state process that would trigger switchings and then derive an explicit solution to this problem in the case where the functional of the diffusion process is identical for each regime, while the diffusion operators are different together with the assumption of possibly negative costs. We extend our work by giving a numerical procedure to compute threshold values in case we know their qualitative structure and finally we illustrate our results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Sampling-based Progressive Hedging Algorithm for Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is a cornerstone among algorithms for large-scale stochastic programming problems. However, its traditional implementation is hindered by some limitations, including the requirement to solve all scenario subproblems in each iteration, reliance on an explicit probability distribution, and a convergence process that is highly sensitive to the choice of certain penalty parameters. This paper introduces a sampling-based PHA which aims to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs a dynamic selection process for the number of scenario subproblems solved per iteration. It incorporates adaptive sequential sampling for determining sample sizes, a stochastic conjugate subgradient method for direction finding, and a line-search technique to update the dual variables. Experimental results demonstrate that this novel algorithm not only addresses the bottlenecks of the conventional PHA but also potentially surpasses its scalability, representing a substantial improvement in the field of stochastic programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of domain reduction techniques has significantly enhanced the performance of solvers in mathematical programming. This paper delves into the impact of integrating convexification and domain reduction techniques within the Outer- Approximation method. We propose a refined convexification-based Outer-Approximation method alongside a Branch-and-Bound method for both convex and nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming problems. These methods have been developed and incorporated into the open-source Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Decomposition Toolbox for Pyomo-MindtPy. Comprehensive benchmark tests were conducted, validating the effectiveness and reliability of our proposed algorithms. These tests highlight the improvements achieved by incorporating convexification and domain reduction techniques into the Outer-Approximation and Branch-and-Bound methods.</description>

      <title>A priori error estimates for optimal control problems governed by the transient Stokes equations and subject to state constraints pointwise in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a state constrained optimal control problem governed by the transient Stokes equations. The state constraint is given by an L2 functional in space, which is required to fulfill a pointwise bound in time. The discretization scheme for the Stokes equations consists of inf-sup stable finite elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin method in time, for which we have recently established best approximation type error estimates. Using these error estimates, for the discrete control problem we establish error estimates and as a by-product we show an improved regularity for the optimal control. We complement our theoretical analysis with numerical results.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the question of whether the outcome of an oligopoly exploiting a nonrenewable resource can be replicated by a related monopoly, within the framework of continuous time and Markov Perfect Nash Equilibrium. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions and find explicit solutions in some cases. Also, very simple models with externalities are shown which Nash equilibrium cannot be replicated in a monopoly.</description>

      <title>Distributed Adaptive Time-Varying Optimization with Global Asymptotic Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study distributed time-varying optimization for a multi-agent system. We first focus on a class of time-varying quadratic cost functions, and develop a new distributed algorithm that integrates an average estimator and an adaptive optimizer, with both bridged by a Dead Zone Algorithm. Based on a composite Lyapunov function and finite escape-time analysis, we prove the closed-loop global asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Particularly, the introduction of the estimator relaxes the requirement for the Hessians of cost functions, and the integrated design eliminates the waiting time required in the relevant literature for estimating global parameter during algorithm implementation. We then extend this result to a more general class of time-varying cost functions. Two numerical examples verify the proposed designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.00216v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book aims to give an introduction to generalized derivative concepts useful in deriving necessary optimality conditions and numerical algorithms for infinite-dimensional nondifferentiable optimization problems that arise in inverse problems, imaging, and PDE-constrained optimization. They cover convex subdifferentials, Fenchel duality, monotone operators and resolvents, Moreau--Yosida regularization as well as Clarke and (briefly) limiting subdifferentials. Both first-order (proximal point and splitting) methods and second-order (semismooth Newton) methods are treated. In addition, differentiation of set-valued mapping is discussed and used for deriving second-order optimality conditions for as well as Lipschitz stability properties of minimizers. Applications to inverse problems and optimal control of partial differential equations illustrate the derived results and algorithms. The required background from functional analysis and calculus of variations is also briefly summarized.</description>

      <title>A Restless Bandit Model for Dynamic Ride Matching with Reneging Travelers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a large-scale ride-matching problem with a large number of travelers who are either drivers with vehicles or riders looking for sharing vehicles. Drivers can match riders that have similar itineraries and share the same vehicle; and reneging travelers, who become impatient and leave the service system after waiting a long time for shared rides, are considered in our model. The aim is to maximize the long-run average revenue of the ride service vendor, which is defined as the difference between the long-run average reward earned by providing ride services and the long-run average penalty incurred by reneging travelers. The problem is complicated by its scale, the heterogeneity of travelers (in terms of origins, destinations, and travel preferences), and the reneging behaviors. To this end, we formulate the ride-matching problem as a specific Markov decision process and propose a scalable ride-matching policy, referred to as Bivariate Index (BI) policy. The BI policy prioritizes travelers according to a ranking of their bivariate indices, which we prove, in a special case, leads to an optimal policy to the relaxed version of the ride-matching problem. For the general case, through extensive numerical simulations for systems with real-world travel demands, it is demonstrated that the BI policy significantly outperforms baseline policies.</description>

      <title>Developing Optimization Models with Cognitive Systems Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One goal of applied operations research is to improve decisions in practice. This requires modelers and stakeholders to have a shared understanding of the system and for the developed model to reflect the system's core dynamics. There are four areas to address: the underlying problem must be understood, the mathematical formulation of the problem must be representative of the system at hand, the data must be appropriate, and the model-generated recommendations must be understandable by the stakeholders. While developing models, operations researchers may primarily rely on past experience in model development, rather than underlying theory, to guide decisions on how to include stakeholders in the modeling process. In parallel, the field of Cognitive Systems Engineering has developed methodologies and practices to understand systems, stakeholder needs, and environments. To improve the rigor of the "application" in applied operations research, we present a framework to integrate Cognitive Systems Engineering methods with optimization model development. We apply the integrated framework to a case study of locating hand sanitizer stations in response to COVID-19 at a large academic institution.</description>

      <title>Best-response algorithms for a class of monotone Nash equilibrium problems with mixed-integer variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the convergence properties of traditional best-response (BR) algorithms in computing solutions to mixed-integer Nash equilibrium problems (MI-NEPs) that turn into a class of monotone Nash equilibrium problems (NEPs) once relaxed the integer restrictions. We show that the sequence produced by a Jacobi/Gauss-Seidel BR method always approaches a bounded region containing the entire solution set of the MI-NEP, whose tightness depends on the problem data, and it is related to the degree of strong monotonicity of the relaxed NEP. When the underlying algorithm is applied to the relaxed NEP, we establish data-dependent complexity results characterizing its convergence to the unique solution of the NEP. In addition, we derive one of the very few sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions to MI-NEPs. The theoretical results developed bring important practical benefits, illustrated on a numerical instance of a smart building control application.</description>

      <title>Mean-field stochastic linear quadratic control problem with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that the mean-field stochastic linear quadratic (MFSLQ) control problem with random coefficients has a unique optimal control and derive a preliminary stochastic maximum principle to characterize this optimal control by an optimality system. However, because of the term of the form $\mathbb{E}[A(\cdot)X(\cdot)] $ in the adjoint equation, which cannot be represented in the form $\mathbb{E}[A(\cdot)]\mathbb{E} [X(\cdot)] $, we cannot solve this optimality system explicitly. To this end, we decompose the MFSLQ control problem into two constrained SLQ control problems without the mean-field terms. These constrained SLQ control problems can be solved explicitly by an extended LaGrange multiplier method developed in this article.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Decentralized Control for Large-scale Inverter-based Resources for Active Power Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs) which lack the intrinsic characteristics such as the inertial response of the traditional synchronous-generator (SG) based sources presents a new challenge in the form of analyzing the grid stability under their presence. While the dynamic composition of IBRs differs from that of the SGs, the control objective remains similar in terms of tracking the desired active power. This letter presents a decentralized primal-dual-based fault-tolerant control framework for the power allocation in IBRs. Overall, a hierarchical control algorithm is developed with a lower level addressing the current control and the parameter estimation for the IBRs and the higher level acting as the reference power generator to the low level based on the desired active power profile. The decentralized network-based algorithm adaptively splits the desired power between the IBRs taking into consideration the health of the IBRs transmission lines. The proposed framework is tested through a simulation on the network of IBRs and the high-level controller performance is compared against the existing framework in the literature. The proposed algorithm shows significant performance improvement in the magnitude of power deviation and settling time to the nominal value under faulty conditions as compared to the algorithm in the literature.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Droop-based Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Control of Inverter-based Resources in Islanded AC Microgrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved droop control method to ensure effective power sharing, voltage regulation, and frequency stabilization of inverter-based resources (IBRs) connected in parallel in an islanded AC microgrid. In the contemporary droop control algorithm, the distance between connected inverters affects the effectiveness of the active power-frequency and the reactive power-voltage droop characteristics which results in poor power sharing at the primary level of the microgrid. That is, high impedance emanating from long transmission lines results in instability, poor voltage tracking, and ineffective frequency regulation. Hence, in this work, we use a finite-control-set model predictive controller (FCS-MPC) in the inner loop, which gives efficient voltage tracking, good frequency regulation, and faster performance response. FCS-MPC is easy to implement in fast switching converters and does not suffer from computational burden unlike the continuous-set MPC and is also devoid of issues of multiple-loop, parameter variation, and slow response associated with conventional droop control methods. We derived the condition for bounded stability for the FCS-MPC and the proposed method is tested via a numerical simulation on three IBRs. The results show effective power sharing, capacitor voltage tracking, and efficient frequency regulation with reduced oscillations to changes in load.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model-Predictive Energy Management Strategy for Shipboard Power Systems Considering Battery Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the integration of loads such as pulse power loads, a new control challenge is presented in meeting their high ramp rate requirements. Existing onboard generators are ramp rate limited. The inability to meet the load power due to ramp rate limitation may lead to instability. The addition of energy storage elements in addition to the existing generators proves a viable solution in addressing the control challenges presented by high ramp rate loads. A distributed energy management strategy maximizing generator efficiency and minimizing energy storage degradation is developed that facilitates an optimal adaptive power split between generators and energy storage elements. The complex structure of the energy storage degradation model makes it tough for its direct integration into the optimization problem and is not practical for real-time implementation. A degradation heuristic to minimize absolute power extracted from the energy storage elements is proposed as a degradation heuristic measure. The designed strategy is tested through a numerical case study of a consolidated shipboard power system model consisting of a single generator, energy storage element, and load model. The results show the impact of the designed energy management strategy in effectively managing energy storage health.</description>

      <title>Fair Incentives for Repeated Engagement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a decision-maker's problem of finding optimal monetary incentive schemes for retention when faced with agents whose participation decisions (stochastically) depend on the incentive they receive. Our focus is on policies constrained to fulfill two fairness properties that preclude outcomes wherein different groups of agents experience different treatment on average. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem, and study it through the use of a closely related deterministic variant. We show that the optimal static solution to this deterministic variant is asymptotically optimal for the dynamic problem under fairness constraints. Though solving for the optimal static solution gives rise to a non-convex optimization problem, we uncover a structural property that allows us to design a tractable, fast-converging heuristic policy. Traditional schemes for retention ignore fairness constraints; indeed, the goal in these is to use differentiation to incentivize repeated engagement with the system. Our work (i) shows that even in the absence of explicit discrimination, dynamic policies may unintentionally discriminate between agents of different types by varying the type composition of the system, and (ii) presents an asymptotically optimal policy to avoid such discriminatory outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal solution of the classical problem of detecting the location of multiple image occurrences in a two-dimensional, noisy measurement. Assuming the image occurrences do not overlap, we formulate this task as a constrained maximum likelihood optimization problem. We show that the maximum likelihood estimator is equivalent to an instance of the winner determination problem from the field of combinatorial auction and that the solution can be obtained by searching over a binary tree. We then design a pruning mechanism that significantly accelerates the runtime of the search. We demonstrate on simulations and electron microscopy data sets that the proposed algorithm provides accurate detection in challenging regimes of high noise levels and densely packed image occurrences.</description>

      <title>Prescribed exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network with delayed feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides control-oriented delay-based modeling of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield-type subject to an external input designed as delayed feedback. The specificity of such a model is that it makes the considered neuron less susceptible to seizure caused by its inherent dynamic instability. This modeling exploits a recently set partial pole placement for linear functional differential equations, which relies on the coexistence of real spectral values, allowing the explicit prescription of the closed-loop solution's exponential decay. The proposed framework improves some pioneering and scarce results from the literature on the characterization of the exact solution's exponential decay when a simple real spectral value exists. Indeed, it improves neural stability when the inherent dynamic is stable and provides insights into the design of a one-layer neural network that can be stabilized exponentially with delayed feedback and with a prescribed decay rate regardless of whether the inherent neuron dynamic is stable or unstable.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on one of the cornerstone problems in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a given membrane. Our approach allows to give a complete solution of the problem for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms on R^2, including the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of all anisotropic extremizers. Such achievements demand that isoanisotropic type problems be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies and involve a deep and fine analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy. As a central outcome we find out a key close relation between shapes and fundamental frequencies for rather degenerate elliptic operators. Our findings also permit to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. This particularly proves the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-laplacian for any p other than 2. Our new sharp lower estimate is just the planar isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality and for the associated optimal constant we provide optimal geometric controls through isodiametric and isoperimetric shape optimization.</description>

      <title>cDVAE: Multimodal Generative Conditional Diffusion Guided by Variational Autoencoder Latent Embedding for Virtual 6D Phase Space Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging the 6D phase space of a beam in a particle accelerator in a single shot is currently impossible. Single shot beam measurements only exist for certain 2D beam projections and these methods are destructive. A virtual diagnostic that can generate an accurate prediction of a beam's 6D phase space would be incredibly useful for precisely controlling the beam. In this work, a generative conditional diffusion-based approach to creating a virtual diagnostic of all 15 unique 2D projections of a beam's 6D phase space is developed. The diffusion process is guided by a combination of scalar parameters and images that are converted to low-dimensional latent vector representation by a variational autoencoder (VAE). We demonstrate that conditional diffusion guided by VAE (cDVAE) can accurately reconstruct all 15 of the unique 2D projections of a charge particle beam's 6 phase space for the HiRES compact accelerator.</description>
