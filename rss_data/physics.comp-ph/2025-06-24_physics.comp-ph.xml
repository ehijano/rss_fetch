      <title>XtalOpt Version 14: Variable-Composition Crystal Structure Search for Functional Materials Through Pareto Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Version 14 of XtalOpt, evolutionary multi-objective global optimization algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from its official website https://xtalopt.github.io. The new version of the code is designed to perform ground state search for novel crystal structures with variable composition by integrating a suite of ab initio methods alongside classical and machine-learning potentials for structural relaxation. The multi-objective search framework has been further enhanced through the introduction of Pareto optimization, enabling efficient discovery of functional materials. Here, we describe the implemented methodologies, provide detailed instructions for their use, and present an overview of additional improvements included in XtalOpt version 14.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Bernoulli-Trial Collisions Families in Treating Rarefied Micro Flows and Hypersonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collision process is essential to the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, as it incorporates the fundamental principles of the Boltzmann and Kac stochastic equations. A series of collision algorithms, known as the Bernoulli-trials (BT) family schemes, have been proposed based on the Kac stochastic equation. The impetus of this paper is to present a comprehensive evaluation of different BT-based collision partner selection schemes, including the simplified Bernoulli-trials (SBT), generalized Bernoulli-trials (GBT), symmetrized and simplified Bernoulli-trials (SSBT), and newly proposed symmetrized and generalized Bernoulli-trials (SGBT), in treating some standard rarefied gas dynamics problems. In these algorithms, the first particle is chosen in a specific order from the list of particles in the cell. For the SBT and GBT, the second particle is chosen from the remaining particles in the list placed after the first particle; however, for SSBT and SGBT, the second particle is chosen from all particles in the list. This means that the SBT and GBT select pairs from the upper triangle of the collision probability matrix, while symmetrized algorithms such as SSBT and SGBT utilize the entire matrix. The results show that the BT-based collision algorithms, compared to the standard "No Time Counter (NTC)" and "Nearest Neighbor (NN)", successfully maintain the collision frequency as the number of particles per cell decreases. Simulation of the Bobylev-Krook-Wu (BKW) exact solution of the Boltzmann equation indicates that, like the GBT, the SGBT algorithm produces the same results as the theory for the average of the 4th moment of the velocity distribution function (VDF).</description>

      <title>Refining Tc Prediction in Hydrides via Symbolic-Regression-Enhanced Electron-Localization-Function-Based Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based materials are able to possess extremely high superconducting critical temperatures, \tc s, due to hydrogen's low atomic mass and strong electron-phonon interaction. Recently, a descriptor based on the Electron Localization Function (ELF) has enabled the rapid estimation of the \tc\ of hydrogen-containing compounds from electronic networking properties, but its applicability has been limited by the small size and homogeneity of the training dataset used. Herein, the model is re-examined compiling a publicly available combined dataset of 244 binary and ternary hydride superconductors. Our analysis shows that though ELF-based networking remains a valuable descriptor, its predictive power declines with increasing compositional complexity. However, by introducing the molecularity index, defined as the highest value of the ELF at which two hydrogen atoms connect, and applying symbolic regression, the accuracy of the predictions can be substantially enhanced. These results establish a more robust framework for assessing superconductivity in hydride materials, facilitating accelerated screening of novel candidates through integration with crystal structure prediction methods or high-throughput searches.</description>

      <title>JAX-LaB: A High-Performance, Differentiable, Lattice Boltzmann Library for Modeling Multiphase Fluid Dynamics in Geosciences and Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JAX-LaB, a differentiable, Python-based Lattice Boltzmann library for simulating multiphase and multiphysics flows in hydrologic, geologic, and engineered porous media. Built as an extension of the XLB library, JAX-LaB utilizes JAX for computations and offers a performant, hardware-agnostic implementation that integrates seamlessly with machine learning workflows and scales efficiently across CPUs, GPUs, and distributed systems. Multiphase interactions are modeled using the Shan-Chen pseudopotential method, which is coupled with an equation of state and an improved forcing scheme to obtain liquid-vapor densities that are consistent with Maxwell's construction, enabling simulations of systems with very large density ratios while maintaining minimal spurious currents. Wetting is handled using the "improved" virtual density scheme, which allows precise control of contact angles and eliminates non-physical films seen in other Shan-Chen wetting methods. We validate the library through several analytical benchmarks, such as Laplace's law, capillary rise, and cocurrent multicomponent flow, and demonstrate some exemplary use cases for the library. We also report single- and multi-GPU performance scaling of the library. The library is open-source under the Apache license and available at https://github.com/piyush-ppradhan/JAX-LaB.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics simulation of the focused electron beam induced deposition process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports on the development of a new approach to the multiscale computational modelling of the focused electron beam-induced deposition (FEBID), realised using the advanced software packages: MBN Explorer and MBN Studio. Our approach is based on stochastic dynamics (SD), which describes the probabilistic evolution of complex systems. The parameters for the new SD-based FEBID model were determined using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A new methodology was developed for this purpose and is described in detail. This methodology can be applied to many other case studies of the dynamics of complex systems. Our work focuses on the FEBID process involving W(CO)$_6$ precursor molecules deposited on a hydroxylated SiO$_2$-H substrate. Simulations and a detailed analysis of a growing W-rich nanostructure were performed. This new approach was shown to provide essential atomistic insights into the complex FEBID process, including the elemental composition and morphology of the deposit at each stage of growth. The derived results were then compared with experimental observations and validated. The multiscale methods developed in this study can be further upgraded and applied to important technological developments, such as 3D nanoprinting.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</description>

      <title>LFR-PINO: A Layered Fourier Reduced Physics-Informed Neural Operator for Parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by 28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution fidelity.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Ti-V Phase Diagram Discrepancy with First-Principles Calculations and Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range, together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting recent CALPHAD reassessments.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions (IRFs). Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The presented methodology is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a finite-element software library, IRENE, for numerically solving the steady state and dynamics of a two-dimensional viscous fluid layer embedded in three-dimensional space, on multiple physical scales. The library is designed to handle a wide range of physical regimes -- both low-Reynolds-number and turbulent ones -- and geometries, capturing the coupling between in-plane flows, out-of-plane deformations, surface tension, and elastic response. In addition, the software can treat complex geometries, including those with intra-layer obstacles or arbitrary layer boundaries. We validate IRENE against known analytical and numerical results and demonstrate its capabilities through examples relevant to biological membranes and macroscopic air flows.</description>

      <title>Corner Topology Makes Woven Baskets into Stiff, yet Resilient Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Basket weaving is a traditional craft used to create practical three-dimensional (3D) structures. While the geometry and aesthetics of baskets have received considerable attention, the underlying mechanics and modern engineering potential remain underexplored. This work shows that 3D woven structures offer similar stiffness yet substantially higher resilience than their non-woven continuous counterparts. We explore corner topologies that serve as building blocks to convert 2D woven sheets into 3D metamaterials that can carry compressive loads. Under small deformations, the woven corners exhibit axial stiffness similar to continuous structures because the woven ribbons are engaged with in-plane loads. Under large deformations, the woven corners can be compressed repeatedly without plastic damage because ribbons can undergo elastic local buckling. We present a modular platform to assemble woven corners into complex spatial metamaterials and demonstrate applications including damage-resilient robotic systems and metasurfaces with tailorable deformation modes. Our results explain the historic appeal of basket weaving, where readily available ribbons are crafted into 3D structures with comparable stiffness yet far superior resilience to continuous systems. The modular assembly of woven metamaterials can further revolutionize design of next-generation automotive components, consumer devices, soft robots, and more where both resilience and stiffness are essential.</description>

      <title>Conservative data-driven finite element formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new data-driven finite element framework derived with mixed finite element formulation. The standard approach to diffusion problems requires the solution of the mathematical equations that describe both the conservation law and the constitutive relations, where the latter is traditionally obtained after fitting experimental data to simplified material models. To exploit all available information and avoid bias in the material model, we follow a data-driven approach. While the conservation laws and boundary conditions are satisfied by means of the finite element method, the experimental data is used directly in the numerical simulations, avoiding the need of fitting material model parameters. In order to satisfy the conservation law a priori in the strong sense, we introduce a mixed finite element formulation. This relaxes the regularity requirements on approximation spaces while enforcing continuity of the normal flux component across all of the inner boundaries. This weaker mixed formulation provides a posteriori error indicators tailored for this data-driven approach, enabling adaptive hp-refinement. The relaxed regularity of the approximation spaces makes it easier to observe how the variation in the datasets results in the non-uniqueness of the solution, which can be quantified to predict the uncertainty of the results. The capabilities of the formulation are demonstrated in an example of the nonlinear heat transfer in nuclear graphite using synthetically generated material datasets.</description>

      <title>Intercalation-Altermagnet-Driven Ferrimagnetic-Ferroelastic Multiferroics and Anomalous and Spin Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin splitting in emerging altermagnets is non-relativistic and momentum-dependent, yet energy-independent and localized, posing challenges for practical applications. Here, we propose a paradigm of intercalation-driven altermagnets to attain ameliorative electronic structures, multiferroic characteristics, and anomalous and spin transport functionalities. As a representative system, we investigate electrochemistry- and self-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers, building on the recently reported room-temperature K- and Rb-intercalated V2Se2O family, utilizing density functional theory, Wannier function analyses, Monte Carlo simulations, and non-equilibrium Green function methods. Intercalation induces room-temperature intralayer ferrimagnetic and interlayer ferromagnetic couplings (358 K for Li-intercalation and 773 K for V-intercalation), ferroelasticity (~1 % signal intensity), in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and metallization, while modifying the anomalous Hall effect. Notably, Li- and V-intercalated V2Se2O bilayers exhibit enhanced spin splitting and half-metallic behavior, respectively, yielding near-perfect spin filtering efficiencies. Intercalation substantially boosts spin transport in V2Se2O-based devices, enabling giant magnetoresistance (877 %), ultra-high thermal tunneling magnetoresistance (~12000 %), and observable spin Seebeck and temperature negative differential resistance effects. Such intercalation-altermagnet-driven paradigm pioneers the expansion of altermagnetic functionalities through multifunctional integration, offering promising avenues for advanced, miniaturized, room-temperature utilization of anomalous, electron, and spin transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-spatial-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. Our results indicate a potential reduction of required data points by at least a factor of 3, while maintaining the current error level. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Equations for Well-Conditioned Direct Numerical Simulations of Rapidly Rotating Convection</title>

Abstract: Convection is a ubiquitous process driving geophysical/astrophysical fluid flows, which are typically strongly constrained by planetary rotation on large scales. A celebrated model of such flows, rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, has been extensively studied in direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory experiments, but the parameter values attainable by state-of-the-art methods are limited to moderately rapid rotation (Ekman numbers $Ek\gtrsim10^{-8}$), while realistic geophysical/astrophysical $Ek$ are significantly smaller. Asymptotically reduced equations of motion, the nonhydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations (NHQGE), describing the flow evolution in the limit $Ek\to 0$, do not apply at finite rotation rates. The geophysical/astrophysical regime of small but finite $Ek$ therefore remains currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce a new, numerically advantageous formulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to0$, the \textit{Rescaled Rapidly Rotating incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations} (RRRiNSE). We solve the RRRiNSE using a spectral quasi-inverse method resulting in a sparse, fast algorithm to perform efficient DNS in this previously unattainable parameter regime. We validate our results against the literature across a range of $Ek$ and demonstrate that the algorithmic approaches taken remain accurate and numerically stable at $Ek$ as low as $10^{-15}$. Like the NHQGE, the RRRiNSE derive their efficiency from adequate conditioning, eliminating spurious growing modes that otherwise induce numerical instabilities at small $Ek$. We show that the time derivative of the mean temperature is inconsequential for accurately determining the Nusselt number in the stationary state, significantly reducing the required simulation time, and demonstrate that full DNS using RRRiNSE agree with the NHQGE at very small $Ek$.</description>

      <title>Development and validation of a high-fidelity full-spectrum Monte Carlo model for the Swiss airborne gamma-ray spectrometry system</title>

Abstract: Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS) is a critical tool for radiological emergency response, enabling the rapid identification and quantification of hazardous terrestrial radionuclides over large areas. However, existing calibration methods are limited to a few gamma-ray sources, excluding most radionuclides released in severe nuclear accidents and nuclear weapon detonations, compromising effective response and risk assessment. Here, we present a high-fidelity Monte Carlo model that overcomes these limitations, offering full-spectrum calibration for any gamma-ray source. Unlike previous approaches, our model integrates a detailed mass model of the aircraft and a calibrated non-proportional scintillation model, enabling accurate event-by-event predictions of the spectrometer's response to arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. Validation in near-, mid-, and far-field scenarios demonstrates that the model not only addresses major deficiencies of previous approaches but also achieves the accuracy required to supersede empirical calibration methods. This advancement enables high-fidelity spectral signature generation for any gamma-ray source, reduces calibration time and costs, minimizes reliance on high-intensity sources, and eliminates related radioactive waste. The approach presented here is a critical step toward integrating advanced full-spectrum data reduction methods for AGRS, unlocking new capabilities beyond emergency response, such as atmospheric cosmic-ray flux quantification for geophysics and trace-level airborne radionuclide identification for nuclear security.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Above-room-temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with altermagnetic CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>

Abstract: Altermagnets with non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room-temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, non-ferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308 %, TER of 707 %, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic-sensing and quantum logic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>
