      <title>Modeling of Real and Imaginary Phase Shifts for $\alpha-\alpha$ Scattering using Malfliet-Tjon Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real and imaginary scattering phase shifts (SPS) and potentials for $\ell=0,2,4$ partial waves have been obtained by developing a novel algorithm$^{\ref{Fig1}}$ to derive inverse potentials using a phenomenological approach. The phase equation, which is a Riccati-type non-linear differential equation, is coupled with the Variational Monte Carlo method. Comparisons between the resulting SPS for various $\ell$ channels and experimental data are made using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as a cost function. Model parameters are fine-tuned through an appropriate optimization technique to minimize MAPE. The results for $\ell=0^+$, $2^+$, and $4^+$ partial waves are generated to align with experimental SPS with mean absolute error (MAE) calculated with respect to experimental data is 3.19, 8.74, 13.06 respectively corresponding to real part and 0.76, 0.76, 0.59 corresponding to imaginary parts of scattering phase shifts.</description>

      <title>The IBM hypothesis and the boson number odd-even effect in $^{196-204}$Hg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the SU3-IBM the oblate shape is described by the \textrm{SU(3)} third-order Casimir operator in the large-$N$ limit. However for finite $N$, this interaction can produce a boson number odd-even effect. In this Letter, the unique odd-even effect is really found in the nuclei $^{196-204}$Hg. This finding implies that realistic low-lying excitations are sensitive to certain boson number $N$. The IBM hypothesis is verified for the first time since the advent of the interacting boson model. This also proves the accuracy and validity of the SU3-IBM directly. The SU(3) symmetry and the higher-order interactions are both indispensable for understanding the nuclear deformations.</description>

      <title>Thermal dilepton polarization and dynamics of the QCD plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical study of the polarization of lepton pairs produced in $\sqrts = 5.02 $ TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, using next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rates. These calculations employ a multi-stage framework to simulate the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and to explore the sensitivity of polarization to early times. It is found that the intermediate invariant-mass dileptons are indeed probes of the thermal equilibration process, and go beyond the reach of hadronic observables. We compute the polarization anisotropy coefficient obtained with LO dilepton rates, and show that the LO and NLO results differ radically, both in trend and in magnitude, at low and intermediate lepton pair invariant masses.</description>

      <title>Higher-order dissipative anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the method of moments to the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and derive the equations of motion for the irreducible moments of arbitrary tensor-rank of the invariant single-particle distribution function. We study two cases, in the first of which the moments are taken to be irreducible with respect to the little group associated with the time-like fluid four-velocity, while in the second case they are assumed to be also irreducible with respect to a space-like four-vector orthogonal to the fluid four-velocity, which breaks the spatial isotropy to a rotational symmetry in the plane transverse to this vector. A systematic truncation and closure of the general moment equations leads, in the first case, to a theory of relativistic higher-order dissipative resistive magnetohydrodynamics. In the second case, we obtain a novel theory of dissipative resistive anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics, where the momentum anisotropy is in principle independent from that introduced by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Secondary Lund jet plane as a gluon enriched sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new strategy to obtain a high-purity sample of gluon-initiated jets at the LHC. Our approach, inspired by the Lund jet plane picture, is to perform a dijet selection where the two jets are collinear to each other and their momentum fraction share is highly asymmetric, and to measure the primary Lund plane density of emissions of the subleading jet. The subleading jet in this topology is practically equivalent to a secondary Lund jet plane. We demonstrate by means of fixed-order calculations that such a simple setup yields gluon jet fractions of around 90% for the subleading jet for both quark- and gluon-initiated jets. This observation is confirmed using hadron-level Monte Carlo generated events. We also show that the extracted gluon purities are highly resilient to the overall colour structure of the event, to the flavour of the hard-scattering process, and to the parton distribution functions. This strategy is well-suited for constraining the radiation pattern of gluon-initiated jets using a set of fiducial cuts that can readily be tested at the LHC, without relying on taggers or statistical demixing.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy and QCD factorization for low-$Q^2$ $\nu$DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is an essential process for exploring the structure of visible matter and testing the standard model. At the same time, the theoretical interpretation of DIS measurements depends on QCD factorization theorems whose validity deteriorates at the lower values of $Q^2$ and $W^2$ typical of neutrino DIS in accelerator-based oscillation searches. For this reason, progress in understanding the origin and limits of QCD factorization is invaluable to the accuracy and precision of predictions for these upcoming neutrino experiments. In these short proceedings, we introduce a novel approach based on the quantum entropy associated with continuous distributions in QCD, using it to characterize the limits of factorization theorems relevant for the description of neutrino DIS. This work suggests an additional avenue for dissecting factorization-breaking dynamics through the quantum entropy, which could also play a role in quantum simulations of related systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical catalysis constrained by LQCD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidences of vortical effects have been recently found by experiments in heavy ion collisions, instigating new insights into the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics. Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD data shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant effects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be essential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions, which predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the angular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating rigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation. To circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective coupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical temperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data. Our results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the chiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking of chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis. For the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the transition temperature when we consider the running coupling. The phase diagram is affected by these findings shifting the critical end point (CEP) to higher temperatures and chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Correlations Between the Neutron Star Mass-Radius Relation and the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic method of inverting the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) relations to high accuracy. This method is developed from the strong correlations that are shown to exist between the neutron star mass-radius curve and the equation of state (EOS) or pressure-energy density relation. Selecting points that have masses equal to fixed fractions of the maximum mass, we find a semi-universal power-law relation between the central energy densities, pressures, sound speeds, chemical potentials and number densities of those stars, with the maximum mass and the radii of one or more fractional maximum mass points. Root-mean-square fitting accuracies, for EOSs without large first-order phase transitions, are typically 0.5\% for all quantities at all mass points. The method also works well, although less accurately, in reconstructing the EOS of hybrid stars with first-order phase transitions. These results permit, in effect, an analytic method of inverting an arbitrary mass-radius curve to yield its underlying EOS. We discuss applications of this inversion technique to the inference of the dense matter EOS from measurements of neutron star masses and radii as a possible alternative to traditional Bayesian approaches.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <title>Screening masses of positive- and negative-parity hadron ground-states, including those with strangeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction (SCI) at nonzero temperature, we compute the screening masses of flavour-SU(3) ground-state $J^P=0^\pm$, $1^\pm$ mesons, and $J^P=1/2^\pm$, $3/2^\pm$ baryons. We find that all correlation channels allowed at $T=0$ persist when the temperature increases, even above the QCD phase transition. The results for mesons qualitatively agree with those obtained from the contemporary lattice-regularised quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) simulations. One of the most remarkable features is that each parity-partner-pair degenerates when $T&gt;T_c$, with $T_c$ being the critical temperature. For each pair, the screening mass of the negative parity meson increases monotonously with temperature. In contrast, the screening mass of the meson with positive parity is almost invariant on the domain $T\lesssim T_c/2$; when $T$ gets close to $T_c$, it decreases but soon increases again and finally degenerates with its parity partner, which signals the restoration of chiral symmetry. We also find that the $T$-dependent behaviours of baryon screening masses are quite similar to those of the mesons. For baryons, the dynamical, nonpointlike diquark correlations play a crucial role in the screening mass evolution. We further calculate the evolution of the fraction of each kind of diquark within baryons respective to temperature. We observe that, at high temperatures, only $J=0$ scalar and pseudoscalar diquark correlations can survive within $J^P=1/2^\pm$ baryons.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking effects in pion couplings to constituent quarks currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudoscalar and axial neutral and charged pion-constituent quark coupling constants are investigated with nondegenerate quark masses in different kinematical points, off shell and on shell pions and constituent quarks. For the neutral pion, mixing effects are introduced by means of the pion mixing to states $P_0$ and $P_8$, that give rise to the $\pi^0-\eta-\eta'$ meson mixing, and mixing of quark currents via corresponding mixing interactions. The relative behavior of charged and neutral pion coupling constants to quarks may be nearly the same - in the framework of the constituent quark model - as the pion-nucleon coupling constants if mixings are introduced. A very small pion coupling to strange quark current is also obtained. The dependence of the positive and negative pion-constituent quark coupling constant on the non-degeneracy of quark masses, for emission and absorption processes, is identified.</description>

      <title>On Determining $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from Dijets in $e^+e^-$ Thrust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We update a previous N$^3$LL$^\prime$+${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$ determination of the strong coupling from a global fit to thrust data by including newly available perturbative ingredients, upgrading the renormalization scales to include a fully canonical scaling region, and implementing the log resummation in a way which ensures the integrated cross section is unaffected by the the leading $1/Q$ hadronization power corrections. Detailed discussions are provided concerning the stability of the results under variations of the fit range and the importance of summing up higher-order logarithmic terms for convergence and stability. We show that high-precision results can be achieved even when carrying out a more conservative fit by restricting the dataset to a region which is more clearly dominated by dijet events. This leads to $\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.1136 \pm 0.0012$ with $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=0.86$, fully compatible with earlier results using a larger fit range. We also demonstrate that a number of additional effects associated to power corrections have a small impact on this fit result, including modifications to the renormalon substraction scheme for dijet power corrections and the inclusion of three-jet power correction models. The fit is also shown to provide very good agreement with data outside the fit range.</description>

      <title>Impact of the pre-equilibrium phase for the determination of nuclear geometry in high-energy isobar collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic isobar collisions have been proposed as a useful tool to investigate nuclear structure. These systems are not created in equilibrium, rather undergo a pre-thermalization stage. In this stage, some of the initial structure information may be lost and additional effects introduced. The objective of this paper is to study this possibility in the extreme case of a "free-streaming" pre-equilibrium stage. We do this by computing estimators for ratios of various measured (or measurable) quantities (elliptic and triangular flows, mean transverse momentum and associated cumulants, correlators between elliptic or triangular flows and mean transverse momentum, symmetric cumulant and two-plane correlator) and study their sensitivity to the duration of the free-streaming stage. We find that the correlators between elliptic or triangular flows and mean transverse momentum, the so-called $\rho_2$ and $\rho_3$, are indeed sensitive to the duration of the free-streaming stage and that the normalized symmetric cumulant, $\varepsilon NSC(2,3)$ might also depend on this duration.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with pions in the neutrino-trapped regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work [B. Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown that the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and transport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new reaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their impact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped regime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find that the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by modifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction pathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the bulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak at temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of tens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the bulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the bulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by an order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller than its peak value.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence for two peaks in the sound speed in cold dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that in addition to the well-known peak inside massive neutron stars, the sound speed in cold dense QCD matter likely exhibits another peak above neutron star densities before it asymptotes to $c_s=\sqrt{C_s}=\sqrt{1/3}$. Based on the framework reported in arxiv:2408.16738, this approach does not rely on any assumption about the ultra-dense matter not realized in nature. Current multimessenger observation of neutron stars favors the two-peak scenario with a Bayes factor $5.1_{-0.7}^{+0.9}$, where the uncertainties are systematics due to models of neutron star inner cores. This evidence grows to $27_{-8}^{+11}$ if the $2.6M_\odot$ component of GW190814 is a neutron star. The trough in $C_s$ separating the two peaks is inferred to be below $0.05^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ (at the $50\%$ level) if $2.6M_\odot$ neutron stars exist. The second peak above $1/3$ beyond baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=1.6-1.9$ GeV most likely signals non-perturbative effects in cold quark matter, for instance color superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Repercussions of the Peccei-Quinn axion on QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The axion, originally postulated by Peccei and Quinn to solve the strong CP problem, has become of great interest in particle and astroparticle phenomenology. Yet it has a problem. It is widely assumed that the axion leaves the nonperturbative features of QCD unscathed. This is, however, not the case. On the contrary, the axion extension is found to be in conflict with seminal results on the low-energy properties of QCD. The key is that the anomalous coupling of the axion to the gauge bosons can be integrated out, leaving behind a path integral over topologically trivial gauge potentials.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of fragmentation functions to charged hadrons with high-precision data from the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation functions (FFs) are essential non-perturbative QCD inputs for predicting hadron production cross sections in high energy scatterings. In this study, we present a joint determination of FFs for light charged hadrons through a global analysis at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. Our analysis incorporates a wide range of precision measurements from the LHC, as well as data from electron-positron collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings. By including measurements of jet fragmentation at the LHC in our global analysis, we are able to impose strong constraints on the gluon FFs. A careful selection of hadron kinematics is applied to ensure the validity of factorization and perturbative calculations of QCD. In addition, we introduce several methodological advances in fitting, resulting in a flexible parametrization form and the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties from perturbative calculations. Our best-fit predictions show very good agreement with the global data, with $\chi^2/N_{pt}\sim 0.90$. We also generate a large number of Hessian error sets to estimate uncertainties and correlations of the extracted FFs. FFs to charged pions (kaons and protons) are well constrained for momentum fractions down to 0.01 (0.1). Total momentum of partons carried by light charged hadrons are determined precisely. Their values for $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon saturate at about 50\% for a lower cut of the momentum fraction of 0.01. Pulls from individual datasets and impact of various choices of the analysis are also studied in details. Additionally, we present an update of the FMNLO program used for calculating hadron production cross sections. Our FFs, including the error sets (denoted as NPC23), are publicly available in the form of LHAPDF6 grids.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors in kinetic theory with two different relaxation times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a Boltzmann equation for massless quark and gluon fluids in a transversally homogeneous, longitudinally boost-invariant expansion. Quarks can be out of chemical equilibrium and the relaxation times of the two species are assumed to be connected by Casimir scaling. We numerically calculate moments of the distribution functions, identifying their early- and late-time attractors and reconstructing also the full distributions. These attractors appear when the system is still far from local thermalization, before hydrodynamics traditionally would be expected to apply. We also analyze the evolution of entropy production for different initial momentum anisotropies and quark abundances.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>Investigating the role of nuclear parameters in Neutron Star oscillations: a model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on the relativistic mean field (RMF) model found certain nuclear empirical parameters, in particular the nucleon effective mass, to be strongly correlated with observable properties of Neutron Stars (NSs), such as the frequencies of $f-$mode oscillations. This shows the potential to constrain the values of effective mass from future observations of $f-$modes. One of our primary goals of this work is to investigate whether such correlations are physical or an artifact of the underlying nuclear model. To test this, we perform a comparative study of the correlations between NS astrophysical observables and nuclear physics parameters using two different equation of state models based on RMF theory and non-relativistic Meta-Modelling (MM) scheme. The nuclear meta-model does not assume any underlying nuclear model and therefore allows us to test the model dependence of the results. The calculations of the $f-$mode characteristics are performed within the relativistic Cowling approximation. We use state-of-the-art nuclear microscopic calculations at low density and multi-messenger astrophysical data at high-density within a Bayesian-inspired scheme to constrain the parameter space of the nuclear models. From the posterior distribution, we probe the underlying correlations among nuclear parameters and with NS observables. We find that the correlation between the symmetry energy and its slope is physical, while that of the nucleon effective mass with NS observables is model-dependent. The study shows that the effective mass governs the high density behaviour in RMF models, while in the MM it is controlled by the higher order saturation parameters, and hence the effective mass in the MM is not correlated with NS observables. The findings of this investigation are interesting both for astrophysics as well as nuclear physics communities.</description>
