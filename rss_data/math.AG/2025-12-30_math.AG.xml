      <title>Orbifold Chern classes and Bogomolov-Gieseker inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that $X$ is a compact complex analytic variety which has quotient singularities in codimension 2, and that $\mathcal{F}$ is a reflexive sheaf on $X$. Using orbifold modifications, we can define first and second homological Chern classes for $\mathcal{F}$. If in addition $X$ has a K\"ahler form $\omega$ and $\mathcal{F}$ is $\omega$-stable, then we deduce Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality on the orbifold Chern classes of $\mathcal{F}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized K-theoretic invariants and wall-crossing via non-abelian localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an abelian category and a stability condition satisfying appropriate conditions, we define generalized $K$-theoretic invariants and prove that they satisfy wall-crossing formulas. For this, we introduce a new associative algebra structure on the $K$-homology of the stack of objects of an abelian category, which we call the $K$-Hall algebra. We first define $\delta$-invariants directly coming from the stack of semistable objects and use the $K$-Hall algebra to take a formal logarithm and construct $\varepsilon$-invariants. We prove that these satisfy appropriate wall-crossing formulas using the non-abelian localization theorem. Based on work of Joyce in the cohomological setting, Liu had previously defined similar invariants assuming the existence of a framing functor; we show that when their definition of invariants makes sense it agrees with ours. Our results extend Joyce--Liu wall-crossing to non-standard hearts of $D^b(X)$, for which framing functors are not known to exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a algebro-geometric combinatorial description of geometrically integral geometrically normal varieties endowed with an effective action of an algebraic torus over arbitrary fields. This description is achieved in terms of divisorial fans endowed with a Galois semilinear action. This work concludes the description of normal $T$-varieties over fields.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of local height pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the asymptotics of the Archimedean part of the Arakelov intersection number. The theorem is motivated by recent conjectures and their proof strategy by Gao and Zhang on the Northcott property of the Beilinson--Bloch height pairing. Our method involves a homological algebra interpretation of the Archimedean height by Hain. This interpretation allows us to introduce motivic viewpoints using Deligne cohomology, cycle class maps and higher Chow groups.
  Especially, we compare the biextension by Hain and Brosnan--Pearlstein over $\mathbb{C}$ based on Poincar\'e line bundle and Hodge theory with the $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}$-biextension of Bloch and Seibold defined by two families of homologically trivial cycles on a generically smooth family of projective varieties over a smooth curve. Our comparison, a relative version of the work of Gorchinskiy, enhances his derived viewpoint on these biextensions. Especially when the family of varieties are smooth, the two constructions are related via derived regulator maps to Deligne cohomology, reinterpreted similarly to Beilinson's absolute Hodge cohomology, as well as the derived description of Hardouin's biextension that generalizes Poincar\'e line bundle by Hain. The comparison when the family defined over a smooth curve has a strongly semistable reduction further involves a simple monodromy computation using mixed Hodge modules.
  Along our discussion, we simplify the discussion of Bloch and Seibold, partly in the style of Gorchinskiy. For example, the symmetry of their biextension is proved more easily than their work.</description>

      <title>Resurgence and perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a point of view on resurgence theory based on the study of perverse sheaves on the complex line carrying an algebraic structure with respect to additive convolution. In particular, we lift the concept of alien derivatives introduced originally by J. \'Ecalle, to the framework of perverse sheaves and study its behavior under sheaf-theoretic convolution. The full fledged resurgence theory needs a (yet undeveloped) generalization of the concept of perverse sheaves allowing infinite, possibly dense, sets of singularities. We discuss possible approaches to defining such objects and some potential examples of them coming from Cohomological Hall Algebras, wall-crossing structures and Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Degeneration of the archimedean height pairing of algebraically trivial cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the limiting behaviour of the archimedean height pairing for homologically trivial algebraic cycles in a degenerating one-parameter family of smooth projective complex varieties. We conjecture that the limit is controlled by the non-archimedean geometric height pairing of the cycles on the generic fiber and verify this for algebraically trivial cycles, assuming a conjecture of Griffiths on incidence equivalence. Our work offers a more geometric understanding of a related asymptotic result of Brosnan--Pearlstein and suggests a new perspective on the positivity of the Beilinson--Bloch height pairing over a one-variable complex function field.</description>

      <title>Wall-crossing for invariants of equivariant 3CY categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a wall-crossing framework for operational enumerative invariants of equivariant 3-Calabi--Yau categories arising from virtual cycles. The strategy follows ideas of Joyce's ``universal'' wall-crossing framework arXiv:2111.04694, using the authors' symmetrized pullback technique to preserve the symmetry of the (almost-perfect) obstruction theories throughout. As an application, we define and study wall-crossings of simple type between operational equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT), Pandharipande--Thomas (PT), and Bryan--Steinberg (BS) vertices. In particular, we give an explicit DT/PT descendent vertex correspondence in the Calabi--Yau limit. As another application, we construct and prove wall-crossing formulas for operational refined semistable Vafa--Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>q-Opers and Bethe Ansatz for Open Spin Chains I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In in a nutshell, the classical geometric $q$-Langlands duality can be viewed as a correspondence between the space of $(G,q)$-opers and the space of solutions of $^L\mathfrak{g}$ XXZ Bethe Ansatz equations. The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Semipositivity of a Nef and Big Line Bundle on Grauert's Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relation between semipositivity, nefness, and bigness of line bundles on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Every nef and big line bundle on a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ is positive when ${\rm dim}\,X = 1$. Kim constructed an explicit example of a nef and big line bundle that is not semipositive in the case ${\rm dim}\,X \ge 3$. Motivated by a conjecture of Filip and Tosatti, we then focus on the case of dimension two. In this talk, we show that the line bundle on Grauert's example is nef and big but not semipositive, by explicitly computing its first obstruction class, which was originally introduced by Koike as a generalization of the Ueda class.</description>

      <title>Bethe subspaces and wonderful models for toric arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the family of commutative subspaces in the trigonometric holonomy Lie algebra $t^{\mathrm{trig}}_{\Phi}$, introduced by Toledano Laredo, for an arbitrary root system $\Phi$. We call these subspaces \emph{Bethe subspaces} because they can be regarded as quadratic components of \emph{Bethe subalgebras} in the Yangian corresponding to the root system $\Phi$, that are responsible for integrals of the generalized XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Bethe subspaces are naturally parametrized by the complement of the corresponding toric arrangement . We prove that this family extends regularly to the minimal wonderful model $X_{\Phi}$ of the toric arrangement described by De Concini and Gaiffi, thus giving a compactification of the parameter space for Bethe subspaces. For classical types $A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n$, we show that this extension is faithful. As a special case, when $\Phi$ is of type $A_n$, our construction agrees with the main result of Aguirre--Felder--Veselov on the closure of the set of quadratic Gaudin subalgebras. Our work is also closely related to, and refines in this root system setting, a parallel compactification result of J. Peters obtained for more general toric arrangements arising from quantum multiplication on hypertoric varieties. Next, we show that the Bethe subspaces assemble into a vector bundle over $X_{\Phi}$, which we identify with the logarithmic tangent bundle of $X_{\Phi}$. Finally, we formulate conjectures extending these results to the setting of Bethe subalgebras in Yangians and to the quantum cohomology rings of Springer resolutions. We plan to address this in our next papers.</description>

      <title>Families of cyclic curve coverings with maximal monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic monodromy of families of cyclic Galois coverings of curves. Under a condition on the $G$-decomposition of the associated variation of Hodge structures, we prove a criterion for the maximality of the monodromy. The proof combines the genus-zero case with a degeneration argument involving Prym varieties of certain admissible coverings. As a consequence of our criterion, we show that for $g\geq 8$ there exists no special family of Galois covers of the type we consider, providing new evidence towards the Coleman-Oort conjecture. Finally, we determine when the loci of double and triple Galois covers are totally geodesic.</description>

      <title>Defect of projective hypersurfaces with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a hypersurface with isolated singularities defined by $f$ in ${\bf P^{n+1}}$ with $n&gt;1$. The difference ${\rm def}(X):=h^{n+1}(X)-h^{n-1}(X)$ is called the defect of $X$ (for self-duality of the cohomology of $X$). It is known that its vanishing is closely related to ${\bf Q}$-factoriality of $X$ in the rational singularity case with $n=3$. This number coincides with the dimension of the cokernel of the inclusion $H^{n-1}(X)\to{\rm IH}^{n-1}(X)$, the rank of the morphism from the vanishing cohomologies of $X$ to $H^{n+1}(X)$ for a one-parameter smoothing of $X$ with total space smooth, and also with the dimension of the unipotent monodromy part of the Milnor fiber cohomology of $f$ with degree $n$. In the case $X$ has only weighted homogeneous isolated singularities, the defect ${\rm def}(X)$ is then given by the $E_2$-term of the spectral sequence of the double complex with differentials ${\rm d}f\wedge$ and $\rm d$ by the $E_2$-degeneration of the pole order spectral sequence. It can be calculated explicitly using a computer even for analogues of the Hirzebruch quintic threefold with more than one hundred ordinary double points found by B.\ van Geemen and J.\ Werner in a compatible way with their computation. We give also an example with ${\rm def}(X)&gt;0$ and $|{\rm Sing}\,X|=1$ where $n=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After recalling the basic notions concerning Higgs-Grassmannian schemes, I review how these latter can be used to define generalisations of the notion of positivity conditions, such as numerically flatness, which "feel" the Higgs field. Then I prove several properties of Higgs bundles, over smooth projective varieties defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$, satisfying these conditions. Finally, I discuss how one can relate them to semistability of the so-called "curve semistable" Higgs bundles.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the Jacobian conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jacobian conjecture is thought to have been proposed by O. H. Keller in 1939. However, we have found that the statement of the conjecture is precisely the main result of a paper published by L. Kraus in 1884. Although the final step of Kraus's proof is flawed, the ideas he introduced anticipated approaches to the problem that would only emerge more than a century later. Interestingly, the root of Kraus's error remains the principal obstacle to algebro-geometric approaches: controlling the ramification at infinity.</description>

Abstract: For any closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, in [P.\ J.\ di\,Dio, K.\ Schm\"udgen: $K$-Positivity Preserver and their Generators, SIAM J.\ Appl.\ Algebra Geom.\ 9 (2025), 794--824] all $K$-positivity preserver have been characterized, i.e., all linear maps $T:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ such that $Tp\geq 0$ on $K$ for all $p\geq 0$ on $K$. An important extension of polynomials $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with real coefficients are polynomials $\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with matrix coefficients. Non-negativity on $K$ for matrix polynomials with Hermitian coefficients $\mathrm{Herm}_m$ is then $p(x)\succeq 0$ for all $x\in K$. In the current work, we investigate linear maps $T:\mathrm{Herm}_m[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathrm{Herm}_m[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. We focus on matrix $K$-positivity preserver, i.e., $Tp\succeq 0$ on $K$ for all $p\succeq 0$ on $K$. For $K=\mathbb{R}^n$ and compact sets $K\subseteq\mathrm{R}^n$, we give characterizations of matrix $K$-positivity preservers. We discuss the difference between the real and the matrix coefficient case and where our proof fails for general sets $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ with $K\neq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $K$ non-compact.</description>

      <title>van Hamel-Lichtenbaum duality for singular varieties over $p$-adic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the van Hamel-Lichtenbaum duality theorem to (not necessarily smooth) proper and geometrically integral varieties defined over a $p$-adic field $k$. More precisely, we prove that for such variety $X$ there exists a natural continuous perfect pairing \[ \mathrm{Br}_1(X)\times H_0(X,\mathbb{Z})_\tau^{\wedge} \to \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}, \] where $\mathrm{Br}_1(X):=\ker(\mathrm{Br}(X)\to\mathrm{Br}(\overline{X}))$ is the algebraic Brauer group of $X$, $H_0(X,\mathbb{Z})_\tau$ is the zeroth group of truncated homology $\mathrm{Hom}_{D(k_{\mathrm{sm}})}(\tau_{\leq 1}R\phi_*\mathbb{G}_{m,X},\mathbb{G}_{m,k})$, $\phi$ is the structure morphism of $X$, and $(-)^{\wedge}$ is the profinite completion functor.</description>

      <title>The Grothendieck Group of the Variety of Spanning Line Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Grothendieck group of the variety $X_{n,k}$ of spanning line configurations introduced by Pawlowski--Rhoades [arXiv:1711.08301] as a geometric model for the generalized coinvariant algebra $R_{n,k}$. Our first result is a localization statement in $K$-theory for the complements of cell closures in smooth cellular varieties. Combining with the Fulton--Lascoux degeneracy loci formula, we prove that $K_0(X_{n,k})$ is canonically isomorphic to $R_{n,k}$, extending classical isomorphisms for the flag variety. We next identify the classes of the Pawlowski--Rhoades varieties with Grothendieck polynomials associated to words $w \in [k]^n$. Motivated by this identification, we develop models of classical and bumpless pipe dreams for words. We show that Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials of words are monomial-weight generating functions for these pipe dreams, extending the classical story from permutations to words and ordered set partitions.</description>

      <title>Lov\'asz--Saks--Schrijver Ideals and the Irreducible Components of the Variety of Orthogonal Representations of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite simple graph $G$ and a positive integer $d$, one can associate to $G$ the Lov\'asz--Saks--Schrijver ideal $L_{G}(d)$, an ideal generated by quadratic polynomials coming from orthogonality conditions. The corresponding variety $\mathbb{V}(L_{G}(d))$, denoted $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$, is the variety of orthogonal representations of the complement graph $\overline{G}$: its points are maps from the vertex set of $G$ to $\mathbb{K}^{d}$ that send adjacent vertices of $G$ to orthogonal vectors. In this paper we study the irreducible decomposition of $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$ and the primary decomposition of $L_{G}(d)$. Our main focus is the case in which $G$ is a forest. Under this assumption, we determine the irreducible components of $\mathrm{OR}_{d}(\overline{G})$, compute their dimensions, and describe their defining equations, thereby obtaining the primary decomposition of $L_{G}(d)$. The key ingredient is a matroid-theoretic framework in which we associate to every forest $G$ a paving matroid $\mathcal{M}(G)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations for type $C$ flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study relations of $\lambda_{y}$-classes associated to tautological bundles over the flag manifold of type $C$ in the quantum $K$-ring. These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation.</description>

Abstract: For any smooth complex projective surface $S$, we construct semistable refined Vafa-Witten invariants of $S$ which prove the main conjecture of arXiv:1810.00078. This is done by extending part of Joyce's universal wall-crossing formalism to equivariant K-theory, and to moduli stacks with symmetric obstruction theories, particularly moduli stacks of sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds. An important technical tool which we introduce is the symmetrized pullback, along smooth morphisms, of symmetric obstruction theories.</description>

      <title>Weighted Ehrhart theory via equivariant toric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a $K$-theoretic and geometric interpretation for a generalized weighted Ehrhart theory of a full-dimensional lattice polytope $P$, depending on a given homogeneous polynomial function $\varphi$ on $P$, and with Laurent polynomial weights $f_Q(y)\in \mathbb{Z}[y^{\pm 1}]$ associated to the faces $Q \preceq P$ of the polytope. For this purpose, we calculate equivariant $K$-theoretic Hodge-Chern classes of a torus-equivariant mixed Hodge module $\mathcal{M}$ on the toric variety $X_P$ associated to $P$. For any integer $\ell$, we introduce an equivariant Hodge $\chi_y$-polynomial $\chi_y(X_P, \ell D_P; [\mathcal{M}])$, with $D_P$ the corresponding ample Cartier divisor on $X_P$ (defined by the facet presentation of $P$). Motivic properties of the Hodge-Chern classes are used to express this equivariant Hodge polynomial in terms of weighted character sums fitting with a generalized weighted Ehrhart theory. The equivariant Hodge polynomials are shown to satisfy a reciprocity and purity formula fitting with the duality for equivariant mixed Hodge modules, and implying similar properties for the generalized weighted Ehrhart polynomials. In the special case of the equivariant intersection cohomology mixed Hodge module, with the weight function given by Stanley's $g$-function of the polar polytope of $P$, we recover in geometric terms a recent combinatorial formula of Beck-Gunnells-Materov. More generally, motivated by the analogy to the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, we introduce a duality involution on the free $ \mathbb{Z}[y^{\pm 1}]$-module of weight functions corresponding to the duality of equivariant mixed Hodge modules, and prove a new reciprocity formula in terms of this duality. This unifies and generalizes the classical reciprocity formula of Brion-Vergne in Ehrhart theory as well as the above-mentioned more recent combinatorial formula of Beck-Gunnells-Materov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain lower bounds for the dimension of fixed loci of diagonalizable $p$-groups acting on smooth projective varieties. Those bounds depend on the modulo $p$ Chern numbers of the ambient variety, and are expressed in a natural way by introducing an appropriate filtration on the "modulo $p$ cobordism ring" (for $p=2$ this is Thom's unoriented cobordism ring $MO^*$). They are obtained using equivariant localization methods, via the concentration theorem for the Chow ring, and by a technique of "partition dividing". As applications we derive statements in the spirit of Boardman's Five-Halves Theorem for involutions on manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $n\geq 3$, and let $L$ be an ample line bundle on $X$. In this article, we study the algebraic hyperbolicity of a very general section of the adjoint linear series $|K_X+mL|$ when the tangent bundle $T_X$ of $X$ has suitable positivity properties. As a consequence, we show that the linear system $|K_X+mL|$ is hyperbolic (or pseudo-hyperbolic) for $m\geq 3n+1$, for various classes of polarized pairs $(X,L)$, thus providing new evidence of a conjecture that was proposed by the second and fourth authors. Moreover, when $X$ is abelian, we show that the linear system $|mL|$ is hyperbolic for $m\geq n$, and the same holds when $m\geq n-1$, if $|L|$ has no base divisors. It turns out that these bounds for abelian varieties are sharp. We also prove analogous statements for Kummer varieties and certain classes of hyperelliptic varieties.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of vector bundles and birational geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and systematically study \emph{hierarchical filtrations} of vector bundles on smooth projective varieties. These are filtrations by saturated subsheaves of equal rank whose successive quotients are torsion sheaves supported in codimension one. The associated numerical invariant, called \emph{hierarchical depth}, measures the maximal length of such filtrations.
  We establish general bounds for hierarchical depth in terms of the determinant class and provide exact formulas for smooth curves and varieties of Picard rank one. A key technical result concerns the commutativity of elementary transforms along disjoint divisors and their role in constructing filtrations.
  For surfaces, we analyze the behavior of hierarchical depth under birational morphisms and prove that it transforms additively along the steps of the minimal model program. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula relating the depth on a surface to that on its minimal model via exceptional divisor contributions.
  As an application, we connect hierarchical depth to degeneracies in algebraic--geometric codes and show that birational simplification via the MMP leads to effective improvements of code parameters. This establishes hierarchical depth as a new bridge between birational geometry, vector bundle theory, and coding theory.</description>

      <title>On the Euclidean Distance Degree of Quadratic Two-Neuron Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: We study the Euclidean Distance degree of algebraic neural network models from the perspective of algebraic geometry. Focusing on shallow networks with two neurons, quadratic activation, and scalar output, we identify the associated neurovariety with the second secant variety of a quadratic Veronese embedding. We introduce and analyze the virtual Euclidean Distance degree, a projective invariant defined as the sum of the polar degrees of the variety, which coincides with the usual Euclidean Distance degree for a generic choice of scalar product. Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian. Applying equivariant localization, we prove that this invariant depends stably polynomially on the input dimension. Numerical experiments based on homotopy continuation illustrate the dependence of the Euclidean Distance degree on the chosen metric and highlight the distinction between the generic and nongeneric cases, such as the Bombieri-Weyl metric.</description>

      <title>Moduli Spaces of Positive Curvature Metrics in Dimension Four and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct non-trivial elements in the homotopy groups of the observer moduli space of positive sectional curvature metrics on $\mathbb{C}P^n$ and non-trivial elements in the homotopy groups of the observer moduli space of positive scalar curvature metrics on $\mathbb{C}P^2 \sharp M^4$.</description>
