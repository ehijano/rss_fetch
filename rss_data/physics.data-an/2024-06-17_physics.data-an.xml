      <title>Heron: Visualizing and Controlling Chemical Reaction Explorations and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated and high-throughput quantum chemical investigations into chemical processes have become feasible in great detail and broad scope. This results in an increase in complexity of the tasks and in the amount of generated data. An efficient and intuitive way for an operator to interact with these data and to steer virtual experiments is required. Here, we introduce Heron, a graphical user interface that allows for advanced human-machine interactions with quantum chemical exploration campaigns into molecular structure and reactivity. Heron offers access to interactive and automated explorations of chemical reactions with standard electronic structure modules, haptic force feedback, microkinetic modeling, and refinement of data by automated correlated calculations including black-box complete active space calculations. It is tailored to the exploration and analysis of vast chemical reaction networks. We show how interoperable modules enable advanced workflows and pave the way for routine low-entrance-barrier access to advanced modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>Intepretative Deep Learning using Domain Adaptation for Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due mainly to the typically small and sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper and meaningful insights into the physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), showing its effectiveness in predicting quality indicators and identifying relevant spectral bands. This work describes significantly innovative results in the use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks as a tool for epileptic seizures forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</description>

      <title>Limits to extreme event forecasting in chaotic systems</title>

Abstract: Predicting extreme events in chaotic systems, characterized by rare but intensely fluctuating properties, is of great importance due to their impact on the performance and reliability of a wide range of systems. Some examples include weather forecasting, traffic management, power grid operations, and financial market analysis, to name a few. Methods of increasing sophistication have been developed to forecast events in these systems. However, the boundaries that define the maximum accuracy of forecasting tools are still largely unexplored from a theoretical standpoint. Here, we address the question: What is the minimum possible error in the prediction of extreme events in complex, chaotic systems? We derive the minimum probability of error in extreme event forecasting along with its information-theoretic lower and upper bounds. These bounds are universal for a given problem, in that they hold regardless of the modeling approach for extreme event prediction: from traditional linear regressions to sophisticated neural network models. The limits in predictability are obtained from the cost-sensitive Fano's and Hellman's inequalities using the R\'enyi entropy. The results are also connected to Takens' embedding theorem using the information can't hurt inequality. Finally, the probability of error for a forecasting model is decomposed into three sources: uncertainty in the initial conditions, hidden variables, and suboptimal modeling assumptions. The latter allows us to assess whether prediction models are operating near their maximum theoretical performance or if further improvements are possible. The bounds are applied to the prediction of extreme events in the R\"ossler system and the Kolmogorov flow.</description>
