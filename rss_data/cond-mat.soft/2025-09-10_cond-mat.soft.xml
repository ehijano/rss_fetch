      <title>Random Trajectory Models for Complex Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many models for complex phenomena use a model for strongly-interacting elements on a small scale to generate larger-scale simulations of some aspects of experimental realizations. These models may be agent-based (as in the case of discrete element method models for granular flow) or based on pattern-forming systems of PDEs (as in models for Raleigh-B\`enard convection patterns). Often these models are purely deterministic, producing a single simulation for each set of initial conditions. If observed realizations demonstrate between-realization variability for important aspects of the phenomenon, those aspects can be simulated by adding probabilistic components to the deterministic models to create random trajectory (RT) models.
  The RT model framework provides probabilistic models which can be fit to data and validated, together with a clear perspective on how difficult it can be to establish any kind of validity for a fitted model. It treats models as code with adjustable coefficients, rather than as systems of differential equations. It provides a simply stated necessary condition for these code models to be easily fit and verified, as well as an argument that this condition can almost never be checked. When the necessary condition cannot be checked, the RT model framework identifies the code models as black box models which may have the capacity for emulating the joint distributions of small collections of statistics observed on realizations, but which can only provide very weak evidence for any form of explanation for the emergence of any aspect of the phenomenon. The framework also provides a way to clearly understand why finding a useful code model and scientifically validating it may require many person-years of extra experimentation and statistical analysis undertaken after the first output-producing code model is constructed and contributed.</description>

      <title>Fast phase prediction of charged polymer blends by white-box machine learning surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compatibilized polymer blends are a complex, yet versatile and widespread category of material. When the components of a binary blend are immiscible, they are typically driven towards a macrophase-separated state, but with the introduction of electrostatic interactions, they can be either homogenized or shifted to microphase separation. However, both experimental and simulation approaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design space of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical interactions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we introduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field theory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly more accurate than conventional black-box machine learning approaches.The random phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine polymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA calculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a parallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally intensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer architecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the computational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly 100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer blend charge-compatibilization designs. More broadly, the white-box machine learning strategy offers a promising approach for dramatic acceleration of polymer field-theoretic methods for mapping out polymer phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Arrested coarsening, oscillations, and memory from a conserved phase separating nucleator in a self-straining cytoskeletal network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do phase separated cellular structures set their size? To elucidate this, we study the dynamics and steady states of a phase separating nucleator that is advected by the self-straining cytoskeletal network which it nucleates. We find (i) that the interplay between transport and the tendency of nucleators to phase separate arrests coarsening; (ii) that the system undergoes damped oscillations towards a patterned steady state with a well defined length scale; (iii) that the system supports a spectrum of patterned states of different steady length scales, enabling the retention of a mechano-chemical memory of the initial conditions. Together, our findings establish a physiologically plausible compound material made of the phase separating nucleator and the self-straining network as a paradigm for mechano-chemical scale selection and memory fixation in cells.</description>

      <title>Comparing unsupervised learning methods for local structural identification in colloidal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying local structures in self-assembled systems is a central challenge in soft matter and materials science. When no a priori knowledge of the relevant structures is available, traditional order parameters often fall short. Unsupervised machine learning provides a convenient route to autonomously uncover structural motifs directly from particle configurations. In this work, we systematically compare three popular dimensionality reduction techniques; Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders (AE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), for classifying local environments in self-assembled systems. We first apply these methods to fluid and crystal configurations of hard and charged spheres. Thereafter, we apply it to an icosahedral arrangement of spheres that self-assembled in spherical confinement, both from simulations as well as from experiments. We demonstrate that UMAP consistently outperforms the other methods in capturing complex structural features, offering a robust tool for structural classification without supervision.</description>

      <title>GRASPion: an Open-Source, Programmable Brainbot for Active Matter Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the GRASPion, a compact, open-source bristlebot designed for the controlled study of active matter systems. Built around a low-cost Arduino-compatible board and modular 3D-printed components, the GRASPion combines ease of use, programmability, and mechanical versatility. It features dual vibrating motors for self-propulsion, integrated sensors for local interaction, and customizable firmware enabling various motion modes, from ballistic to diffusive regimes. The robot is equipped with onboard IR communication, color and proximity sensors, and a magnetometer, allowing for real-time interaction and complex collective behaviors. With a runtime exceeding 90 minutes and reproducible fabrication, the GRASPion provides a robust and scalable platform for both educational and research applications in out-of-equilibrium physics. This article details the mechanical and electronic design and software architecture of the GRASPion, and illustrates its capabilities through prototypical experiments relevant to active matter.</description>

      <title>Sorting of binary active-passive mixtures in designed microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixtures of active and passive particles are ubiquitous at the microscale. Many essential microbial processes involve interactions with dead or immotile cells or passive crowders. When passive objects are immersed in active baths, their transport properties are enhanced and can be tuned by controlling active agents' spatial and orientational distribution. Active-passive mixtures provide a platform to explore fundamental questions about the emergent behaviour of passive objects under simultaneous thermal and active noise and a foundation for technological applications in cargo delivery and bioremediation. In this work, we use computational simulations to study an active-passive mixture confined in microchannels designed with funnel-like obstacles that selectively allow the passage of passive particles. Active particles follow overdamped Langevin translational dynamics and run-and-tumble rotational dynamics. We find that adjusting the tumbling rate of active agents and the microchannel geometry leads to a maximum enhancement of the transport properties of the passive particles (diffusion coefficient and advective velocity) that correlates with the highest mixture sorting efficiency and the shortest response time.</description>

      <title>Slit-snapping and multistability in buckled beams with partial cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic instabilities such as buckling and snapping have evolved into a powerful design principle, enabling memory, sequential shape morphing, and computing in metamaterials and devices. Modifying the post-buckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of post-buckling behavior: under compression, slit-beams first buckle, then snap, leading to trista-bility within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multi-slit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multi-step snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left and right-buckled states. Our strategy is general, simple to design and implement, and enables mechanical metamaterials and devices with advanced memory and sequential behavior.</description>

      <title>Mode-coupling theory of the glass transition for a liquid in a periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a microscopic theory for the structural dynamics in the vicinity of the glass transition for a liquid exposed to a one-dimensional periodic potential. The periodic potential breaks translational invariance, in particular, the density exhibits a periodic modulation. Using techniques familiar from solid-state theory, we define generalized intermediate scattering functions from fluctuating densities in wave-vector space. Exact equations of motion are derived within the Mori-Zwanzig projection-operator formalism reflecting the residual lattice symmetries. Due to the lack of rotational symmetry it is necessary to split the currents into components parallel and perpendicular to the modulation. We provide a closure of the equations in terms of a mode-coupling approximation for the force kernel. The theory reflects the usual analytic properties of correlation functions and encodes all phenomena known for mode-coupling theories. We prove that the theory reduces to the conventional mode-coupling theory in the case of vanishing amplitude of the modulation.</description>

      <title>Glass transition in colloidal monolayers controlled by light-induced caging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the glass-transition problem for a quasi-two-dimensional colloidal dense suspension modulated by a one-dimensional periodic external potential as imposed by interfering laser beams. Relying on a mode-coupling approach, we examine the nonequilibrium state diagram for hard disks as a function of the density and the period of the modulation for various potential strengths. The competition between the local packing and the distortion of the cages induced by the potential leads to a striking nonmonotonic behavior of the glass-transition line which allows melting of a glass state merely by changing the external fields. In particular, we find regions in the non-equilibrium state diagram where a moderate periodic modulation stabilizes the liquid state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a detailed review of the methods proposed to implement Mindlin's no-slip and partial slip model under constant normal loading and Mindlin Deresiewicz's extensional work on micro-slip under varying normal loading, for the simulation of granular flow. Various methods that followed Mindlin's and Mindlin and Deresiewicz's approaches for modeling the tangential contact between two spherical particles are reviewed thoroughly, first, to understand the tangential load-displacement behaviour and finally to compare the tangential coefficient of restitution obtained from each of these models with the experimentally determined values reported in the literature. The tangential load-displacement behaviour obtained from the integral method is qualitatively different from that determined by the incremental method, which accounts for the loading history. Tangential and rotational coefficient of restitution in the gross sliding regime obtained from all the models show excellent agreement with the experimental result, but in the sticking regime, the agreement is only qualitative.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Glass Transition through Active Fluctuating Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuating pairwise interactions are understood to drive fluid-like states in dense biological systems. These states find a broad range of functionalities, such as directing growth during morphogenesis and forming aggregates with heightened mechanical response. However, a tractable model capturing the role of microscopic fluctuating interactions in these structural transitions is crucially lacking. Here, we study a $p$-spin model with fluctuating pairwise couplings (of strength $D_a$ and persistence time $t_a$) as a schematic model for interaction-mediated fluidization. We find that while stronger fluctuations suppress the glass transition, more persistent fluctuations have the opposite effect. We identify the presence of an emergent fluctuation-dissipation relation at long times. We numerically extract the critical temperature $T_c(D_a, t_a)$ from a scaling relation near the transition, illustrating how microscopic fluctuations control the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Dependent Defect Merging Induces Bifurcated Dynamics in Active Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of defect merging remain poorly understood. Here we report a geometry-tunable merging mechanism in microtubule-motor networks initiated by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-close. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to zip up cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of overlapping boundary layers where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby merge the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is tunable by the network geometry.</description>

      <title>Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Depletion-Induced Interactions Modulate Nanoscale Protein Diffusion in Polymeric Crowder Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating protein dynamics in cellular and in vitro environments. Polymeric crowders such as dextran and Ficoll are known to induce entropic forces, including depletion interactions, that promote structural organization, but the nanoscale consequences for protein dynamics remain less well understood. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the dynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and Ficoll. We find that depletion-driven short-range attractions combined with long-range repulsions give rise to intermediate-range order (IRO) once the polysaccharide overlap concentration $c^*$ is exceeded. These IRO features fluctuate on microsecond to millisecond timescales, strongly modulating the collective dynamics of ferritin. The magnitude of these effects depends sensitively on crowder type, concentration, and molecular weight. Normalizing the crowder concentration by $c^*$ reveals scaling behavior in ferritin self-diffusion with a crossover near 2$c^*$, marking a transition from depletion-enhanced mobility to viscosity-dominated slowing. Our results demonstrate that bulk properties alone cannot account for protein dynamics in crowded solutions, underscoring the need to include polymer-specific interactions and depletion theory in models of crowded environments.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants that have lower environmental impact than traditional vapour compression fluids. However, optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without diminishing parameters including the accessible latent heat. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with just 2% pentaerythritol to improve the phase transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change ($|\Delta S_{it,rev}|$ = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that the temperature range of the first-order phase transition is broadened because the intermolecular hydrogen bond network is disrupted by the presence of molecular dopants. Dynamic effects are revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering, which shows reduced activation energies for the molecular rotational modes underpinning the entropic component of the barocaloric effect. We propose that exploiting the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is an effective strategy for designing practicable molecular BCs.</description>

      <title>Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05715</link>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</description>
