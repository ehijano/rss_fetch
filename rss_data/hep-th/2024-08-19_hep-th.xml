      <title>Hawking Radiation in Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hawking radiation in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for minimally coupled massless and massive scalar fields. We employ a holography-inspired technique to derive the Bogoliubov coefficients. We consider both black holes in equilibrium and black holes attached to a bath. In the latter case, we compute semiclassical deviations from the thermal spectrum.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative topological string theory on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds from M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the full non-perturbative topological string free energy, in the holomorphic limit, follows simply from a target space integrating out calculation of M2 states. Qualitatively, this is the same as the calculation performed by Gopakumar and Vafa, but we find that the final expression must be modified due to a subtlety with poles induced by non-perturbative physics. Accounting for this modification leads to a Gopakumar-Vafa-like formula, which we propose as the exact formulation of the integrating out procedure. Evaluating the formula necessarily requires a contour integral in a complexified Schwinger proper time parameter. We show that this evaluation yields the full non-perturbative topological string free energy, and can be applied to an arbitrary compact, or non-compact, Calabi-Yau threefold.</description>

      <title>A Pr\'ecis: Minimal Four Color Holoraumy and Wolfram's "New Kind of Science" Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adinkras are graphical representations of the gauge invariant field components in supersymmetric theories and their orbits under the action of supersymmetry (SUSY) generators in the context of supermultiplets. A discussion is given that provides a thorough review of the concepts of holoraumy, permutahedra, and gadgets. One consequence of these concepts, the additional concept of hopper operators, is discussed. These play a particularly important role that ignites the processes needed for the study of adinkras related to minimal 4D, $\cal N$ = 1 supermultiplets (chiral, vector, tensor and complex linear supermultiplets) through the prism of very simple cellular automata following Wolfram's `New Kind of Science' paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Nordita conference that was held in Moscow in 1981 was the first place where I met Lars. This "marvellous meeting", as Lars quoted in one of his reminiscence article, was organised by Alan Luther. It was an event that generated a long-lasting friendship of scientists from East and West, provided a background for the future collaborations and, in particular, my own collaboration with Lars on a supersymmetric high-spin extension of the Poincar\'e group.</description>

      <title>Spin-2 operators in two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ quivers from massive type IIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of studying spin-2 fluctuations around a class of solutions in massive type IIA that is given by a warped $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{S}^2 \times \text{T}^4 \times \mathcal{I}_{\rho}$ and with $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ supersymmetry. We were able to identify a class of fluctuations, which is known as the ``minimal universal class'' that is independent of the background data and saturates the bound on the mass related to the field theory unitarity bound. These operators have conformal dimension $\Delta = 2(\ell+1)$, with $\ell$ being the quantum number of the angular momentum on the $\text{S}^2$. We also computed the normalisation of the $2$-point function of stress-energy tensors from the effective $3$-dimensional graviton action. We comment on the relation of our results to the related $\text{AdS}_3$ and $\text{AdS}_2$ solutions in massive type IIA and type IIB theories respectively.</description>

      <title>New purely damped pairs of quasinormal modes in a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbed black holes exhibit damped oscillations whose eigenfrequencies define their quasinormal modes (QNMs). In the case of asymptotically AdS black holes, the spectra of QNMs are related to the near-equilibrium behavior of specific strongly interacting quantum field theories via the holographic gauge-gravity duality. In the present work, we numerically obtain the spectra of homogeneous non-hydrodynamic QNMs of a top-down holographic construction describing a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma. The main result is the discovery of a new structure of pairs of purely imaginary QNMs. Those new purely damped QNMs dominate the late time equilibration of the strongly-coupled plasma at large values of the chemical potential, while at lower values the fundamental QNMs are instead ordinary poles with imaginary and real parts describing oscillatory decaying perturbations. We also observe a new phenomenon of asymptotic pole fusion for different pairs of purely imaginary QNMs at asymptotically large values of the chemical potential. This phenomenon corresponds to the asymptotic merging of the two poles within each pair of purely imaginary QNMs, indicating that characteristic equilibration times for the plasma develop upper bounds that cannot be surpassed by further doping the medium with increasing values of the chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: We have investigated bound state solutions for a scalar particle described in the spacetime of a chiral cosmic string subjected to rotational effects in a Kaluza-Klein theory. We saw that combinations between the parameters that describe the generalized spacetime impose upper and lower limits for the radial coordinate leading to well-established boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Explicit Construction of Hermitian Yang-Mills Instantons on Coset Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In four dimensions, 't Hooft symbols offer a compact and powerful framework for describing the self-dual structures fundamental to instanton physics. Extending this to six dimensions, the six-dimensional 't Hooft symbols can be constructed using the isomorphism between the Lorentz group $Spin(6)$ and the unitary group $SU(4)$. We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual structures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly organized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a systematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin connections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft symbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as instanton and Euler numbers.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of holographic steady flows near a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of steady flows in a holographic first-order phase transition model, from the thermodynamics at equilibrium to the real-time dynamics far from equilibrium. Through spinodal decomposition and condensation nuclei, the phase-separated state with non-zero momentum is obtained, respectively. In such a geometric configuration, in addition to energy density, there is also a gap between coexisting phases for momentum density or longitudinal pressure, which is found to be characterized by flow velocity and latent heat. Furthermore, by introducing an inhomogeneous scalar external source to simulate a fixed obstacle, the dynamical response of momentum loss of the moving system is revealed. In particular, using the phase-separated state with uniform flow velocity as the background, we find that the moving high-energy phase exhibits four characteristic dynamical behaviors when interacting with an obstacle, rebounding, pinning, passing and splitting, depending on its velocity and the strength of the obstacle.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Sigma Models and Yang-Baxter Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the Yang-Baxter deformation with higher-spin auxiliary field deformations to construct a multi-parameter family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ with semi-simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Our construction produces one integrable deformation for each pair $(\mathcal{R}, E)$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is an antisymmetric bilinear operator on $\mathfrak{g}$ obeying the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation and $E$ is a function of several variables. We show that every model in this family is (weakly) classically integrable by exhibiting a Lax representation for its equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Computation of the index on orbifold from the Atiyah-Segal-Singer fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the independent chiral zero modes on the orbifolds from the Atiyah-Segal-Singer fixed point theorem. The required information for this calculation includes the fixed points of the orbifold and the manner in which the spatial symmetries act on these points, unlike previous studies that necessitated the calculation of zero modes. Since the fixed point theorem can be applied to any fermionic theory on any orbifold, it allows us to determine the index even on orbifolds where the calculation of zero modes is challenging or in the presence of non-trivial gauge configurations.
  We compute the indices on the $T^{2}/ \mathbb{Z}_N\,(N=2,3,4,6)$ and $T^{4}/ \mathbb{Z}_N\,(N=2,3,5)$ as examples. Furthermore, we also attempt to compute the indices on a Coxeter orbifold related to the $D_4$ lattice.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative phase boundaries in the Gross-Neveu model from a stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two out of three phase boundaries of the 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the chiral limit can be obtained from a standard, perturbative stability analysis of the homogeneous phases. The third one separating the massive homogeneous phase from the kink crystal is non-perturbative and could so far only be inferred from the full solution of the model. We show that this phase boundary can also be obtained via a modified stability analysis, based on the thermodynamic potential of a single kink or baryon. The same method works for the massive Gross-Neveu model, so that all phase boundaries of the Gross-Neveu model could have been predicted quantitatively without prior knowledge of the full crystal solution.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the bicrossproduct structure of the quantum group $\varrho$-Poincar\'e and of the dual quantum universal enveloping algebra, expanding the construction to general Lie algebra-type deformations of Poincar\'e coming from classical $r$-matrices. We review the relation between different bases of the quantum universal enveloping algebra of $\varrho$-Poincar\'e and noncommutative $\star$-products defined on the $\varrho$-Minkowski spacetime, analysing some of their relevant features. Furthermore, we comment on the role of physical bases and introduce the $\varrho$-Poincar\'e quantum Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>1d Conformal Field Theory and Dispersion Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conformal field theory in $d=1$ space-time dimensions. We derive a dispersion relation for the 4-point correlation function of identical bosons and fermions, in terms of the double discontinuity. This extends the conformal dispersion relation of arXiv:1910.12123, which holds for CFTs in dimensions $d\geq 2$, to the case of $d=1$. The dispersion relation is obtained by combining the Lorentzian inversion formula with the operator product expansion of the 4-point correlator. We perform checks of the dispersion relation using correlators of generalised free fields and derive an integral relation between the kernel of the dispersion relation and that of the Lorentzian inversion formula. Finally, for $1$-$d$ holographic conformal theories, we analytically compute scalar Witten diagrams in $AdS_2$ at tree-level and $1$-loop.</description>

      <title>Holographic M-Brane Super-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature.
  Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embedding of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds. The result seems to be novel and shows that the holographic M-probes, static with respect to the Poincar\'e chart, must sit exactly at the throat radius.</description>

      <title>Non-planar corrections in ABJM theory from quantum M2 branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization of semiclassical strings in AdS spacetimes yields predictions for the strong-coupling behaviour of the scaling dimensions of the corresponding operators in the planar limit of the dual gauge theory. Finding non-planar corrections requires computing string loops (corresponding to torus and higher genus surfaces), which is a challenging task. It turns out that in the case of the $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory there is an alternative approach: one may semiclassically quantize M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$. Such M2 branes are the M-theory generalization of the strings in AdS$_4\times $CP$^3$. In this work, we show that by expanding in large M2 brane tension $ T_2 \sim \sqrt{kN} $ for fixed $k$, followed by an expansion in large $k$, we can predict the large $\lambda$ asymptotics of the non-planar corrections to the dimensions of the dual ABJM operators. As a specific example, we consider the M2 brane configuration that generalizes the long folded string with large spin in AdS$_4$, and compute the 1-loop correction to its energy. This calculation allows us to determine non-planar corrections to the universal scaling function or cusp anomalous dimension. We extend our analysis to the semiclassical M2 branes that generalize the "short" and "long" circular strings with two equal angular momenta in CP$^3$. The "short" M2 brane corresponds to a dual operator whose dimension at strong coupling scales as $\Delta \sim \lambda^{1/4} + \dots$, and we derive the leading non-planar correction to it.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity as a Probe for Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in detail, the time evolution of Krylov complexity. We demonstrate, through analytical computations, that in finite many-body systems, while ramp and plateau are two generic features of Krylov complexity, the manner in which complexity saturates reveals the chaotic nature of the system. In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the saturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite saturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also exhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity approaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer timescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific spin models.</description>

      <title>Three-Loop OPE Wilson Coefficients of Dimension-Four Operators for (Axial-)Vector and (Pseudo-)Scalar Current Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the three-loop Wilson coefficients of all physically relevant dimension-four operators, i.e. $G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a,\mu\nu}$, $m_i\bar q_j q_j$ and $m_i m_j m_k^2$, in the short-distance expansion of the time-ordered product of a pair of gauge-singlet vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar currents. The results are given for a general non-Abelian gauge theory with arbitrary (compact semi-simple) gauge group and $n_f$ light fermion flavors (quarks) in a common arbitrary representation of the gauge group, which includes QCD as a special case. In particular, we allow for arbitrary flavor contents of each of the currents. For the axial-vector current the included contributions from so-called singlet diagrams are consistent with the one-loop axial anomaly.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Accidental Suppression of Wilson Coefficients in Higgs Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higgs couplings are essential probes for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) since they can be modified by new physics, such as through the Higgs portal interaction $|H|^2\mathcal{O}$. These modifications influence Higgs interactions via dimension-6 operators of the form $ \left(\partial |H|^2\right)^2$ and $|H|^6$, which are generally expected to be of comparable size. This paper discusses a phenomenon of accidental suppression, where the $|H|^6$ coupling is significantly smaller than $\left(\partial |H|^2\right)^2$. This suppression, arising from the truncation of the tree-level effective potential, lacks a clear symmetry explanation but persists in portal models. This paper aims to inspire further studies on additional instances of accidental suppression without symmetry explanations or a general framework to characterize such suppression. We also discuss constraints, at the HL-LHC and future colliders, on the Wilson coefficients of the two dimension-6 operators for various benchmark scenarios of the concrete model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that covariant energy conservation is maintained. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

Abstract: We explore Noether symmetries of Horndeski gravity, extending the classification of general scalar-tensor theories. Starting from the minimally coupled scalar field and the first-generation scalar-tensor gravity, the discussion is generalised to kinetic gravity braiding and Horndeski gravity. We highlight the main findings by focusing on the non-minimally coupled Gauss-Bonnet term and the extended cuscuton model. Finally, we discuss how the presence of matter can influence Noether symmetries. It turns out that the selected Horndeski functions are unchanged with respect to the vacuum case.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Cannot be Violated in Gedanken Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We innovate a systematic investigation of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) using gedanken experiments involving black hole perturbations by test particles. We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in recent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We provide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous studies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign choice of the parameter $W\equiv \big(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\big)_{Q_i; T=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W &gt; 0$ preserves WCCC and $W &lt; 0$ would indicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W&gt;0$ for spherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue that it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider asymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation either.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The path integral approach to a quantum theory of gravity is widely regarded as an indispensable strategy. However, determining what additional elements, beyond black hole or AdS spacetime, should be incorporated into the path integral remains crucial yet perplexing. We argue that the spacetime with a conical singularity in its Euclidean counterpart should be the most important ingredient to append to the path integral. Therefore, physical quantities should be ensemble-averaged over all geometries since they are described by the same Lorentzian metric. When the ensemble average is introduced, the Hawking-Page transition for the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole and the small-large black hole transition for the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole naturally arise as semi-classical approximations, when the size of the black hole system is much larger than the Planck length. Away from the semi-classical limit, the system is a superposition of different geometries, and the averaged quantities would deviate from the black hole thermodynamics. Expanding around the classical saddles, the subleading order of Newton's constant contributions can be derived, which are both half of the Hawking temperature for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. The result may imply a universal structure. The subsubleading terms and more intriguing physics that diverge from black hole thermodynamics are revealed. The ensemble-averaged theory provides a new way of studying subleading effects and extending the traditional AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the stress within a strongly coupled scalar nucleon, and now dissect the gravitational form factors into contributions from its constituents, the (mock) nucleon and the (mock) pion. The computation is based on a non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa model in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism with a Fock sector expansion including up to one nucleon and two pions. By employing the ``good currents" $T^{++}_i$, $T^{+-}_i$ and $T^{12}_i$, we extract the full set of gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$, $\bar c_i$ without the contamination of the spurious form factors, and free of uncanceled UV divergences. With these results, we decompose the mass of the system into its constituents and compute the matter and mechanical radii, gaining insights into the strongly coupled system.</description>

Abstract: We study the electroweak phase transition dynamics with a three-dimensional standard model effective field theory under a gauge-invariant approach. We observe that, at the two-loop level, the phase transition parameters obtained with the gauge invariant approach can at most deviate from that of the dimensional reduction method around the percent level. We further found that the predicted gravitational wave signals at the new physics scale $\Lambda\gtrsim 590$ GeV are unreachable by the space-based interferometers, such as: LISA, TianQin, and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Quantum Corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes in Kiselev Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the intricate thermodynamic topology of quantum-corrected Anti-de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstrm (AdS-RN) black hole within the framework of Kiselev spacetime. By employing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy approach, we meticulously compute the thermodynamic topology of these selected black holes. Furthermore, we establish their topological classifications. Our findings reveal that quantum correction terms influence the topological charges of black holes in Kiselev spacetime, leading to novel insights into topological classifications. Our research findings elucidate that, in contrast to the scenario in which $\omega=0$ and $a=0.7$ with total topological charge $W=0$ and $\omega=-4/3$ with total topological charge $W=-1$, in other cases, the total topological charge for the black hole under consideration predominantly stabilizes at +1. This stabilization occurs with the significant influence of the parameters a, c, and $\omega$ on the number of topological charges. Specifically, when $\omega$ assumes the values of $\omega=-1/3$, $\omega=-2/3$ , $\omega=-1$, the total topological charge consistently be to W = +1.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a series of results aimed at bringing saturation physics and gluon tomography into an era of precision. In particular, the NLO treatment of diffractive: 1) exclusive dijet, 2) exclusive longitudinally polarized light vector meson and 3) semi-inclusive single or double hadron photo- or electroproduction with large $p_T$, on a nucleon or a nuclei. Finally, we discuss the more complicated 4) exclusive transversely polarized light vector meson production, which starts at the next-to-leading power and therefore requires a beyond leading twist treatment. This new class of processes provides an access to precision physics of gluon saturation dynamics, with very promising future phenomenological studies at the EIC, or, at the LHC in $p A$ and $A A$ scattering, using Ultra Peripheral Collisions (UPC).</description>

      <title>Collisional corrections to spin polarization from quantum kinetic theory using Chapman-Enskog expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the collisional corrections to the spin polarization pseudo-vector, $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$, using quantum kinetic theory in Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating M{\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using hard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the vector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the validity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by gradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified, but $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on the coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution function is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional corrections $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario are at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{2}\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative analysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the future numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this paper, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

Abstract: The standard proposal within the context of General relativity and its weak field Newtonian limit for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of dark matter particles of unknown type. In the present work and specifically for spiral galaxy rotation curves, an alternative possibility is explored, in the form of an axially symmetric vortex mass distribution of finite extent threading the centre of the galaxy and perpendicular to its disk. Some general considerations are developed and characteristic properties are identified, pointing to the potential interest of such an alternative to be studied in earnest.</description>

Abstract: This work elaborates on a detailed analysis of the novel characteristics of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within the framework of modified gravity (MOG). Our study begins by exploring the geometrical and dynamical properties of the Kerr-MOG spacetime. We employ the numerical kludge (NK) method for waveform simulations and reveal that the parameter $\alpha$, representing deviations from general relativity (GR), significantly impacts the frequencies of geodesic orbits and, consequently, the EMRI waveforms. However, the waveform confusion problem remains mainly unresolved, posing a challenge in distinguishing between the underlying gravitational theories based on the observed EMRI waveforms. Notably, by incorporating the effects of radiation reaction, we observe a substantial reduction in the waveform overlap over time. This reduction could enhance our ability to discern between different waveforms over an extended period.</description>

Abstract: Simulating nonequilibirum dynamics of a quantum many-body system is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We simulate the time evolution of one-dimensional ${\bf Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. We consider the Floquet circuit made of the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian evolution and focus on its dynamics toward thermalization. Quantum simulation with the help of error mitigation is successful in running the Floquet circuit made of $38$ and $116$ qubits up to $10$ Trotter steps in the best case. This is enough to reach the early stage of prethermalization. Our work would be a benchmark for the potential power of quantum computing for high-energy physics problems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of the breaking of integrability in the integrals of motion of a sine-Gordon-like system. The class of quasi-integrable models, discussed in the literature, inherits some of the integrable properties they are associated with. Our strategy, to investigate the problem through a deformation of the so-called inverse scattering method, has proven to be useful in the discussion of generic nonlinear Klein-Gordon potentials, as well as in particular cases presented here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a prototype for Wilsonian analysis of asymptotics of supersymmetric partition functions of non-abelian gauge theories. Localization allows expressing such partition functions as an integral over a BPS moduli space. When the limit of interest introduces a scale hierarchy in the problem, asymptotics of the partition function is obtained in the Wilsonian approach by $i)$ decomposing (in some suitable scheme) the BPS moduli space into various patches according to the set of light fields (lighter than the scheme dependent cut-off $\Lambda$) they support, $ii)$ localizing the partition function of the effective field theory on each patch (with cut-offs set by the scheme), and $iii)$ summing up the contributions of all patches to obtain the final asymptotic result (which is scheme-independent and accurate as $\Lambda\to\infty$). Our prototype concerns the Cardy-like asymptotics of the 4d superconformal index, which has been of interest recently for its application to black hole microstate counting in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$. As a byproduct of our analysis we obtain the most general asymptotic expression for the index of gauge theories in the Cardy-like limit, encompassing and extending all previous results.</description>

      <title>The full analytic trans-series in integrable field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a family of generalized energy densities in integrable quantum field theories in the presence of an external field coupled to a conserved charge. By using the Wiener-Hopf technique to solve the linear thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations we derive the full analytic trans-series for these observables in terms of a perturbatively defined basis. We show how to calculate these basis elements to high orders analytically and reveal their complete resurgence structure. We demonstrate that the physical value of the generalized energy densities is obtained by the median resummation of their ambiguity-free trans-series.</description>

      <title>Decoherence Induced by the Noise of Primordial Graviton with Minimum Uncertainty Initial States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the decoherence induced by the primordial graviton, using the influence functional method, to show whether this method is still effective in detecting graviton if the initial state is not a Bunch-Davies vacuum but rather a minimum uncertainty state. This minimum uncertainty condition allows the initial state of the primordial graviton to be an entanglement state between the polarization or, more generally, a superposition state between a vacuum and that entanglement. Both of those states have a non-classical correlation between the two polarization modes. We found that this method is still effective for detecting gravitons if the density matrix of the initial state does not have non-diagonal elements, where the maximum decoherence time is about 20 seconds, and the dimensions of the interferometer could be reduced if the total graviton increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a brief recount of small and large gauge transformations and the nature of observables, we discuss superselection sectors in gauge theories. There are an infinity of them, classified by large gauge transformations. Gauge theory sectors are labelled by the eigenvalues of a complete commuting set (CCS) of these transformations.
  In QED, the standard chemical potential is one such operator generating global U(1). There are many more given by the moments of the electric field on the sphere at infinity. In QCD, the CCS are constructed from the two commuting generators spanning a Cartan subalgebra.
  Large gauge transformations commute with the Hamiltonian and preserve the equations of motion. They form an infinite number of `classical symmetries'. But most of them are anamolous changing the superselection sectors.
  We show that any element of a large gauge transformation can be added to the standard Hamiltonian as a generalised chemical potential without changing field equations and that in QCD, they lead to confined and deconfined phases . A speculation about the physical meaning of these chemical potentials is also made.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions and the blackbody thermal laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions (on and above $d=2$) is investigated in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics theories that depend exclusively on the invariant $\mathcal{F}\left(=-(1/4)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\right)$. In this vein, we consider propagating waves under the influence of external uniform electric and magnetic fields. Features related to the blackbody radiation in the presence of a background constant electric field such as the generalization of the spectral energy density distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are obtained. Interestingly enough, anisotropic contributions to the frequency spectrum appear in connection to the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field. In addition, the long wavelength regime and Wien's displacement law in this situation are studied. The corresponding thermodynamics quantities at thermal equilibrium, such as energy, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity densities are contemplated as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of spinning particles using scattering amplitudes and eikonal exponentiation. We show that observables are determined by a simple algorithm. A wealth of complexity arises in perturbation theory as positions, momenta and spins must be iteratively corrected at each order. Even though we restrict ourselves to one-loop computations at quadratic order in spin, nevertheless we encounter and resolve a number of subtle effects. Finally, we clarify the links between our work and various other eikonal approaches to spinning observables.</description>

      <title>Ascending the attractor flow in the D1-D5 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study maximally supersymmetric irrelevant deformations of the D1-D5 CFT that correspond to following the attractor flow in reverse in the dual half-BPS black string solutions of type IIB supergravity on K3. When a single, quadratic condition is imposed on the parameters of the 22 such irrelevant deformations, the asymptotics of the solution degenerate to a linear dilaton like spacetime. We identify each such degeneration limit with a known decoupling limit of string theory, which yields little string theory or deformations thereof (the so-called open brane LST, or ODp theories), compactified to two dimensions. This suggests that a 21-parameter family of the above deformations leads to UV-complete theories, which are string theories decoupled from gravity that are continuously connected to each other. All these theories have been argued to display Hagedorn behaviour; we show that including the F1 strings leads to an additional Cardy term. The resulting entropy formula closely resembles that of single-trace $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs, whose generalisations could provide possibly tractable effective two-dimensional descriptions of the above web of theories.
  We also consider the asymptotically flat black strings. At fixed temperature, the partition function is dominated by thermodynamically stable, small black string solutions, similar to the ones in the decoupled backgrounds. We show that certain asymptotic symmetries of these black strings bear a striking resemblance with the state-dependent symmetries of single-trace $T\bar T$, and break down precisely when the background solution reaches the large black string threshold. This suggests that small, asymptotically flat black strings may also admit a $T\bar T$ - like effective description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations related to worldsheet and spacetime isometries. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>From area metric backgrounds to the cosmological constant and corrections to the Polyakov action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Area metrics and area metric backgrounds provide a unified framework for quantum gravity. They encode physical degrees of freedom beyond those of a metric. These non-metric degrees of freedom must be suppressed by a potential at sufficiently high energy scales to ensure that in the infrared regime classical gravity is recovered. On this basis, we first study necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for an area metric to be induced by a metric. Second, we consider candidate potentials for the area metric and point out a possible connection between the reduction of area metric geometry to metric geometry on the one hand, and the smallness of the cosmological constant on the other. Finally, we consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action for a string, from a metric background to an area metric background. We demonstrate that area metric perturbations introduce an interaction corresponding to a singular vertex operator in the classically equivalent Polyakov action. The implications of these types of vertex operators for the quantum theory remain to be understood.</description>

      <title>Double Copy of 3D Chern-Simons Theory and 6D Kodaira-Spencer Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply an algebraic double copy construction of gravity from gauge theory to three-dimensional (3D) Chern-Simons theory. The kinematic algebra ${\cal K}$ is the 3D de Rham complex of forms equipped, for a choice of metric, with a graded Lie algebra that is equivalent to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket on polyvector fields. The double copied gravity is defined on a subspace of ${\cal K}\otimes \bar{\cal K}$ and yields a topological double field theory for a generalized metric perturbation and two 2-forms. This local and gauge invariant theory is non-Lagrangian but can be rendered Lagrangian by abandoning locality. Upon fixing a gauge this reduces to the double copy of Chern-Simons theory previously proposed by Ben-Shahar and Johansson. Furthermore, using complex coordinates in $\mathbb{C}^3$ this theory is related to six-dimensional (6D) Kodaira-Spencer gravity in that truncating the two 2-forms and one equation yields the Kodaira-Spencer equations on a 3D real slice of $\mathbb{C}^3$. The full 6D Kodaira-Spencer theory can instead be obtained as a consistent truncation of a chiral double copy.</description>

Abstract: We study certain higher point thermal correlators of heavy and light scalar primaries in a holographic CFT. Assuming simple self-interactions and couplings of the scalars in the bulk theory, we show that the thermal correlators contain a signature of the proper time to singularity from the horizon. The key idea is to use WKB approximations for the propagators and evaluate the bulk integrals using saddle point method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of the Hamiltonian formulation of string theory, a widely acknowledged issue is the inability of the first-class constraints to accurately reproduce the Lagrangian symmetry transformations. We take a critical look at the Hamiltonian formulation of the Polyakov string and demonstrate, using Castellani's procedure, that diffeomorphism and Weyl symmetries naturally emerge without using any field-dependent reparametrization, thus preserving the theoretical consistency between Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions. Additionally, we will review the standard Hamiltonian analysis of the symmetries in terms of lapse and shift functions and show that the reason behind this failure is not due to the non-canonicity of the variables but rather because this parametrization fails to preserve general covariance.</description>

      <title>Normalization of ZZ instanton amplitudes in type 0B minimal superstring theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ZZ instanton corrections in the $(2,4k)$ $N=1$ minimal superstring theory with the type 0B GSO projection, which becomes the type 0B $N=1$ super-JT gravity in the $k \to \infty$ limit. Each member of the $(2,4k)$ family of theories has two phases distinguished by the sign of the Liouville bulk cosmological constant. The worldsheet method for computing the one-loop normalization constant multiplying the instanton corrections gives an ill-defined answer in both phases. We fix these divergences using insights from string field theory and find finite, unambiguous results. Each member of the $(2,4k)$ family of theories is dual to a double-scaled one-matrix integral, where the double-scaling limit can be obtained starting either from a unitary matrix integral with a leading one-cut saddle point, or from a hermitian matrix integral with a leading two-cut saddle point. The matrix integral exhibits a gap-closing transition, which is the same as the double-scaled Gross-Witten-Wadia transition when $k=1$. We also compute instanton corrections in the double-scaled matrix integral for all $k$ and in both phases, and find perfect agreement with the string theory results.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the differential geometry of the moduli space of instantons on S^3 x S^1. Extending previous results, we show that a sigma-model with this target space can be expected to possess a large N=4 superconformal symmetry, supporting speculations that this sigma-model may be dual to Type IIB superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers -- the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a "level" (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed. The central charges of the large N=4 algebra agree, at least semiclassically, with expectations from the duality.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>A holographic model of magnetohydrodynamics with fortuitous SO(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study magnetohydrodynamics using holography. The gravity model is closely related to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical black brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form symmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.</description>

      <title>Self-duality from twisted cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a notion of self-duality for differential equations of maximal cuts was introduced, which states that there should be a basis in which the matrix for an {\epsilon}-factorised differential equation is persymmetric. It was observed that the rotation to this special basis may introduce a Galois symmetry relating different integrals. We argue that the proposed notion of self-duality for maximal cuts stems from a very natural notion of self-duality from twisted cohomology. Our main result is that, if the differential equations and their duals are simultaneously brought into canonical form, the cohomology intersection matrix is a constant. Furthermore, we show that one can associate quite generically a Lie algebra representation to an {\epsilon}-factorised system. For maximal cuts, this representation is irreducible and self-dual. The constant intersection matrix can be interpreted as expressing the equivalence of this representation and its dual, which in turn results in constraints for the differential equation matrix. Unlike the earlier proposal, the most natural symmetry of the differential equation matrix is defined entirely over the rational numbers and is independent of the basis choice.</description>

      <title>A theory for the zeros of Riemann $\zeta$ and other $L$-functions (updated)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.4358</link>
      <description>arXiv:1407.4358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures we first review the important properties of the Riemann $\zeta$-function that are necessary to understand the nature and importance of the Riemann hypothesis (RH). In particular this first part describes the analytic continuation, the functional equation, trivial zeros, the Euler product formula, Riemann's main result relating the zeros on the critical strip to the distribution of primes, the exact counting formula for the number of zeros on the strip $N(T)$, and the GUE statistics of the zeros on the critical line. We then turn to presenting some new results obtained in the past year and describe several strategies towards proving the RH. First we describe an electrostatic analogy and argue that if the electric potential along the line $\Re (z) =1$ is a regular alternating function, the RH would follow. The main new result is that the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one correspondence with the zeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a transcendental equation for the $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends only on $n$. If there is a unique solution to this equation for every $n$, denoting $N_0 (T)$ the number of zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) = N(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the critical line. These results are generalized to two infinite classes of functions, Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions based on modular forms. We present extensive numerical analysis of the solutions of these equations. We apply these methods to the Davenport-Heilbronn $L$-function, which is known to have zeros off of the line, and explain why the RH fails in this case. We also present a new approximation to the $\zeta$-function that is analogous to the Stirling approximation to the $\Gamma$-function.
  In this updated version we added references to subsequent publications that made progress on open questions posed in the previous version from 10 years ago.</description>

      <title>Paradoxes before the paradox: surface gravity and the information loss problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13939v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The information loss paradox is widely regarded as one of the biggest open problems in theoretical physics. Several classical and quantum features must be present to enable its formulation. First, an event horizon is needed to justify the objective status of tracing out degrees of freedom inside the black hole. Second, evaporation must be completed (or nearly completed) in finite time according to a distant observer, and thus the formation of the black hole should also occur in finite time. In spherical symmetry these requirements constrain the possible metrics strongly enough to obtain a unique black hole formation scenario and match their parameters with the semiclassical results. However, the two principal generalizations of surface gravity, the quantity that determines the Hawking temperature, do not agree with each other on the dynamical background. Neither can correspond to the emission of nearly-thermal radiation. We infer from this that the information loss problem cannot be consistently posed in its standard form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every regular graph, we define a sequence of integers, using the recursion of the Martin polynomial. This sequence counts spanning tree partitions and constitutes the diagonal coefficients of powers of the Kirchhoff polynomial. We prove that this sequence respects all known symmetries of Feynman period integrals in quantum field theory. We show that other quantities with this property, the $c_2$ invariant and the extended graph permanent, are essentially determined by our new sequence. This proves the completion conjecture for the $c_2$ invariant at all primes, and also that it is fixed under twists. We conjecture that our invariant is perfect: Two Feynman periods are equal, if and only if, their Martin sequences are equal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The survival probability of an initial Coherent Gibbs State (CGS) is a natural extension of the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) to open quantum systems. To quantify the interplay between quantum chaos and decoherence away from the semi-classical limit, we investigate the relation of this generalized SFF with the corresponding $l_1$-norm of coherence. As a working example, we introduce Parametric Quantum Channels (PQC), a discrete-time model of unitary evolution mixed with the effects of measurements or transient interactions with an environment. The Energy Dephasing (ED) dynamics arises as a specific case in the Markovian limit. We demonstrate our results in a series of random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Topology of black hole thermodynamics via R\'enyi statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, $d$-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black hole and five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black hole via the R\'enyi statistics. We find that the topological number calculated via the R\'enyi statistics is different from that obtained from the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) statistics. However, what is interesting is that the topological classifications of different black holes are consistent in both the R\'enyi and GB statistics: the four-dimensional RN black hole, four-dimensional and five-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black holes, five-dimensional charged and uncharged Gauss-Bonnet black holes belong to the same kind of topological class, and the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole and $d(&gt;5)$-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to another kind of topological class. In addition, our results suggest that the topological numbers calculated via the R\'enyi statistics in asymptotically flat spacetime background are equal to those calculated from the standard GB statistics in asymptotically AdS spacetime background, which provides more evidence for the connection between the nonextensivity of the R\'enyi parameter $\lambda$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of gravitational field: A perspective on monogamy relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields induced by massive quantum particles is an important starting point for quantum gravity. The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields. To this end, we consider a trade-off relation of entanglement (monogamy relation) in a tripartite system consisting of two massive particles and a gravitational field that may be entangled with each other. Consequently, if two particles cannot exchange information mutually, they are in a separable state, and the particle and gravitational field are always entangled. Furthermore, even when two particles can send information to each other, there is a trade-off between the two particles and the gravitational field. We also investigate the behavior of the quantum superposition of the gravitational field using quantum discord. We find that quantum discord increases depending on the length scale of the particle superposition. Our results may help understand the relationship between the quantization of the gravitational field and the meaning of the quantum superposition of the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the Dyson-Schwinger Equation approach of QCD for the quark propagator at complex chemical potential to study the QCD phase transition. The phase transition line of the $(2+1)$-flavor QCD matter in the imaginary chemical potential region is computed via a simplified truncation scheme, whose curvature is found to be consistent with the one at real chemical potential. Moreover, the computation in the complex chemical potential plane allows us to determine the location of the Lee-Yang edge singularities. We show explicitly that the critical end point coincides with the Lee-Yang edge singularities on the real $\mu_{B}^{}$ axis. We also investigate the scaling behavior of the singularities and discuss the possibility of extrapolating the CEP from a certain range of chemical potential.</description>

      <title>CosmoFlow: Python Package for Cosmological Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators hold the key to high-energy physics as they probe the earliest moments of our Universe, and conceal hidden mathematical structures. However, even at tree-level, perturbative calculations are limited by technical difficulties absent in flatspace Feynman diagrammatics. In this paper, we introduce CosmoFlow: a new accurate open source Python code that computes tree-level cosmological correlators by tracing their time flow. This code is specifically designed to offer a simple, intuitive and flexible coding environment to theorists, primordial and late-time cosmologists. It can typically serve to complement analytical computations, to provide physical intuition when studying various inflationary theories, and to obtain exact results in regimes that are analytically out of reach. This paper presents the basic structure of CosmoFlow, leads the reader through an in-depth user-guide, and illustrates how it can be used with a series of worked examples. Our hope is that this first building block sets the stage for a bank of theoretical data, which can be nurtured and enhanced collaboratively by the community. CosmoFlow is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Growth rate of self-sustained QED cascades induced by intense lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was suggested [A. R. Bell &amp; J. G. Kirk, PRL 101, 200403 (2008)] that an avalanche of electron-positron pairs can be triggered in the laboratory by a standing wave generated by intense laser fields. Here, we present a general solution to the long-standing problem of the avalanche growth rate calculation. We provide a simple formula that accounts for the damping of the growth rate due to pair and photon migration from the region of prolific generation. We apply our model to a variety of 3D field configurations including focused laser beams and show that i) the particle yield for the full range of intensity able to generate an avalanche can be predicted, ii) a critical intensity threshold due to migration is identified, iii) the effect of migration is negligible at a higher intensity and the local growth rate dominates. Excellent agreement with Monte Carlo and self-consistent PIC simulations is shown. The growth rate calculation allows us to predict when abundant pair production will induce a back-reaction on the generating field due to plasma collective effects and screening. Our model can be applied to study the generation of electron-positron pair avalanches in realistic fields to plan future experiments at ultra-high-intensity laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet patching, 1-form symmetries, and "Landau-star" phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions of gauge theories has relied heavily on simplifications that arise at the boundaries of phase diagrams, where certain excitations are forbidden. Taking 2+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory as an example, the simplification can be visualized geometrically: on the phase diagram boundaries the partition function is an ensemble of closed membranes. More generally, however, the membranes have "holes" in them, representing worldlines of virtual anyon excitations. If the holes are of a finite size, then typically they do not affect the universality class, but they destroy microscopic (higher-form) symmetries and microscopic (string) observables. We demonstrate how these symmetries and observables can be restored using a "membrane patching" procedure, which maps the ensemble of membranes back to an ensemble of closed membranes. (This is closely related to the idea of gauge fixing in the "minimal gauge", though not equivalent.) Membrane patching makes the emergence of higher symmetry concrete. Performing patching in a Monte Carlo simulation with an appropriate algorithm, we show that it gives access to numerically useful observables. For example, the confinement transition can be analyzed using a correlation function that is a power law at the critical point. We analyze the quasi-locality of the patching procedure and discuss what happens at a self-dual multicritical point in the gauge-Higgs model, where the lengthscale $\ell$ characterizing the holes diverges.</description>

      <title>No time to derive: unraveling total time derivatives in in-in perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation, such as the (scalar and tensor) exchange trispectrum and the one-loop power spectrum. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model in which the Gauss-Bonnet invariant holds the quintessence at a fixed point, respecting an initial $Z_2$ symmetry in the radiation-dominated era. This results in an early dark energy that becomes significant around the matter-radiation equality era. However, due to $Z_2$ symmetry breaking, scalarization occurs, leading to a rapid reduction in the early dark energy density. The model then quickly behaves like the $\Lambda$CDM model. This scenario may also explain the reduction of sound horizon and aligns with the assumption that the gravitational wave speed is infinitesimally close to the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum field theory in Rindler spacetime with superselection rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) in Rindler spacetime is a gateway to understanding unitarity and information loss paradoxes in curved spacetime. Rindler coordinates map Minkowski spacetime onto regions with horizons, effectively dividing accelerated observers into causally disconnected sectors. Employing standard quantum field theory techniques and Bogoliubov transformations between Minkowski and Rindler coordinates yields entanglement between states across these causally separated regions of spacetime. This results in a breakdown of unitarity, implying that information regarding the entangled partner may be irretrievably lost beyond the Rindler horizon. As a consequence, one has a situation of pure states evolving into mixed states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for comprehending this phenomenon using a recently proposed formulation of direct-sum quantum field theory (DQFT), which is grounded in superselection rules formulated by the parity and time reversal ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. In the context of DQFT applied to Rindler spacetime, we demonstrate that each Rindler observer can, in principle, access pure states within the horizon, thereby restoring unitarity. However, our analysis also reveals the emergence of a thermal spectrum of Unruh radiation. This prompts a reevaluation of entanglement in Rindler spacetime, where we propose a novel perspective on how Rindler observers may reconstruct complementary information beyond the horizon. Furthermore, we revisit the implications of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem within the framework of DQFT. Lastly, we underscore how our findings contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the role of unitarity in quantum field theory within the context of de Sitter and black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>

Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the '$U$' and '$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the quantum phase transitions of metals</title>

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a deformation or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Kasner dynamics inside anisotropic black hole with vector hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal dynamics of hairy black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-vector theory. The development of the charged vector hair necessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic black hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is characterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We show that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be captured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of transformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically, including the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our analytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full equations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the alternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Rotating AdS black holes in Kaniadakis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes by applying the Kaniadakis(KD) entropy framework. This framework represents a non-extensive generalization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries of relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic phase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three prominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the Kerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their thermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our analysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional Gibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>
