      <title>Multi-material topology optimization of electric machines under maximum temperature and stress constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of topology optimization methods for the design of electric machines has become increasingly popular over the past years. Due to a desired increase in power density and a recent trend to high speed machines, thermal aspects play a more and more important role. In this work, we perform multi-material topology optimization of an electric machine, where the cost function depends on both electromagnetic fields and the temperature distribution generated by electromagnetic losses. We provide the topological derivative for this coupled multi-physics problem consisting of the magnetoquasistatic approximation to Maxwell's equations and the stationary heat equation. We use it within a multi-material level set algorithm in order to maximize the machine's average torque for a fixed volume of permanent-magnet material, while keeping the temperature below a prescribed value. Finally, in order to ensure mechanical stability, we additionally enforce a bound on mechanical stresses. Numerical results for the optimization of a permanent magnet synchronous machine are presented, showing a significantly improved performance compared to the reference design while meeting temperature and stress constraints.</description>

      <title>Corner Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider SGD-type optimization on infinite-dimensional quadratic problems with power law spectral conditions. It is well-known that on such problems deterministic GD has loss convergence rates $L_t=O(t^{-\zeta})$, which can be improved to $L_t=O(t^{-2\zeta})$ by using Heavy Ball with a non-stationary Jacobi-based schedule (and the latter rate is optimal among fixed schedules). However, in the mini-batch Stochastic GD setting, the sampling noise causes the Jacobi HB to diverge; accordingly no $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ algorithm is known. In this paper we show that rates up to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$ can be achieved by a generalized stationary SGD with infinite memory. We start by identifying generalized (S)GD algorithms with contours in the complex plane. We then show that contours that have a corner with external angle $\theta\pi$ accelerate the plain GD rate $O(t^{-\zeta})$ to $O(t^{-\theta\zeta})$. For deterministic GD, increasing $\theta$ allows to achieve rates arbitrarily close to $O(t^{-2\zeta})$. However, in Stochastic GD, increasing $\theta$ also amplifies the sampling noise, so in general $\theta$ needs to be optimized by balancing the acceleration and noise effects. We prove that the optimal rate is given by $\theta_{\max}=\min(2,\nu,\tfrac{2}{\zeta+1/\nu})$, where $\nu,\zeta$ are the exponents appearing in the capacity and source spectral conditions. Furthermore, using fast rational approximations of the power functions, we show that ideal corner algorithms can be efficiently approximated by finite-memory algorithms, and demonstrate their practical efficiency on a synthetic problem and MNIST.</description>

      <title>On Equivalence Between Decentralized Policy-Profile Mixtures and Behavioral Coordination Policies in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained decentralized team problem formulations are good models for many cooperative multi-agent systems. Constraints necessitate randomization when solving for optimal solutions -- our past results show that joint randomization amongst the team is necessary for (strong) Lagrangian duality to hold -- , but a better understanding of randomization still remains. For a partially observed multi-agent system with Borel hidden state and finite observations and actions, we prove the equivalence between joint mixtures of decentralized policy-profiles (both pure and behavioral) and common-information based behavioral coordination policies (also mixtures of them). This generalizes past work that shows equivalence between pure decentralized policy-profiles and pure coordination policies. The equivalence can be exploited to develop results on strong duality and number of randomizations.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Proximal Gradient ADMM for Nonconvex Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Perturbed Proximal Gradient ADMM (PPG-ADMM) framework for solving general nonconvex composite optimization problems, where the objective function consists of a smooth nonconvex term and a nonsmooth weakly convex term for both primal variables.
  Unlike existing ADMM-based methods which necessitate the function associated with the last updated primal variable to be smooth, the proposed PPG-ADMM removes this restriction by introducing a perturbation mechanism, which also helps reduce oscillations in the primal-dual updates, thereby improving convergence stability.
  By employing a linearization technique for the smooth term and the proximal operator for the nonsmooth and weakly convex term, the subproblems have closed-form solutions, significantly reducing computational complexity. The convergence is established through a technically constructed Lyapunov function, which guarantees sufficient descent and has a well-defined lower bound.
  With properly chosen parameters, PPG-ADMM converges to an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point at a sublinear convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$.
  Furthermore, by appropriately tuning the perturbation parameter $\beta$, it achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point, providing stronger optimality guarantees. We further apply PPG-ADMM to two practical distributed nonconvex composite optimization problems, i.e., the distributed partial consensus problem and the resource allocation problem. The algorithm operates in a fully decentralized manner without a central coordinating node. Finally, numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of PPG-ADMM, demonstrating its improved convergence performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an intrinsic approach for addressing control problems with systems governed by linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We use computer algebra to constrain a Gaussian Process on solutions of ODEs. We obtain control functions via conditioning on datapoints. Our approach thereby connects Algebra, Functional Analysis, Machine Learning and Control theory. We discuss the optimality of the control functions generated by the posterior mean of the Gaussian Process. We present numerical examples which underline the practicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Open Loop Layout Optimization: Feasible Path Planning and Exact Door-to-Door Distance Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Loop Layout Problem (OLLP) seeks to position rectangular cells of varying dimensions on a plane without overlap, minimizing transportation costs computed as the flow-weighted sum of pairwise distances between cells. A key challenge in OLLP is to compute accurate inter-cell distances along feasible paths that avoid rectangle intersections. Existing approaches approximate inter-cell distances using centroids, a simplification that can ignore physical constraints, resulting in infeasible layouts or underestimated distances. This study proposes the first mathematical model that incorporates exact door-to-door distances and feasible paths under the Euclidean metric, with cell doors acting as pickup and delivery points. Feasible paths between doors must either follow rectangle edges as corridors or take direct, unobstructed routes. To address the NP-hardness of the problem, we present a metaheuristic framework with a novel encoding scheme that embeds exact path calculations. Experiments on standard benchmark instances confirm that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods, delivering superior solution quality and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Integral control of the proximal gradient method for unbiased sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximal gradient methods are popular in sparse optimization as they are straightforward to implement. Nevertheless, they achieve biased solutions, requiring many iterations to converge. This work addresses these issues through a suitable feedback control of the algorithm's hyperparameter. Specifically, by designing an integral control that does not substantially impact the computational complexity, we can reach an unbiased solution in a reasonable number of iterations. In the paper, we develop and analyze the convergence of the proposed approach for strongly-convex problems. Moreover, numerical simulations validate and extend the theoretical results to the non-strongly convex framework.</description>

      <title>A scalable mixed-integer conic optimization approach to cardinality-constrained Poisson regression with safe screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for cardinality-constrained Poisson regression to address feature selection challenges in high-dimensional count data. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer conic optimization, enabling the use of modern solvers for optimal solutions. To enhance computational efficiency, we develop a safe screening based on Fenchel conjugates, thereby effectively removing irrelevant features before optimization. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our safe screening significantly reduces the problem size, leading to substantial improvements in computational time. Our approach can solve Poisson regression problems with tens of thousands of features, exceeding the scale of previous studies. This work provides a valuable tool for interpretable feature selection in high-dimensional Poisson regression.</description>

      <title>Kinetic simulated annealing optimization with entropy-based cooling rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modified simulated annealing method with a dynamical choice of the cooling temperature. The latter is determined via a closed-loop control and is proven to yield exponential decay of the entropy of the particle system. The analysis is carried out through kinetic equations for interacting particle systems describing the simulated annealing method in an extended phase space. Decay estimates are derived under the quasi-invariant scaling of the resulting system of Boltzmann-type equations to assess the consistency with their mean-field limit. Numerical results are provided to illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of stochastic processes, with applications to supermartingale convergence, Dvoretzky's approximation theorem, and stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a novel and general result on the asymptotic behavior of stochastic processes which conform to a certain relaxed supermartingale condition. Our result provides quantitative information in the form of an explicit and effective construction of a rate of convergence for this process, both in mean and almost surely, that is moreover highly uniform in the sense that it only depends on very few data of the surrounding objects involved in the iteration. We then apply this result to derive new quantitative versions of well-known concepts and theorems from stochastic approximation, in particular providing effective rates for a variant of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem, Dvoretzky's convergence theorem, as well as the convergence of stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences, the latter of which formulated in a novel and highly general metric context. We utilize the classic and widely studied Robbins-Monro procedure as a template to evaluate our quantitative results and their applicability in greater detail. We conclude by illustrating the breadth of potential further applications with a brief discussion on a variety of other well-known iterative procedures from stochastic approximation, covering a range of different applied scenarios to which our methods can be immediately applied. Throughout, we isolate and discuss special cases of our results which even allow for the construction of fast, and in particular linear, rates.</description>

Second, we consider its generalization to the setting of area preserving diffeomorphisms of the annulus. In both cases, we show how the problem can be linked to permutohedra, majorization, and to gradient flows with respect to a suitable metric.</description>

      <title>A Bi-Objective MDP Design approach to redundancy allocation with dynamic maintenance for a parallel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability of a system can be improved by the addition of redundant elements, giving rise to the well-known redundancy allocation problem (RAP), which can be seen as a design problem. We propose a novel extension to the RAP called the Bi-Objective Integrated Design and Dynamic Maintenance Problem (BO-IDDMP) which allows for future dynamic maintenance decisions to be incorporated. This leads to a problem with first-stage redundancy design decisions and a second-stage sequential decision problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a continuous-time Markov Decision Process Design framework to formulate a problem with non-trivial dynamics, as well as its first use alongside bi-objective optimization. A general heuristic optimization methodology for two-stage bi-objective programmes is developed, which is then applied to the BO-IDDMP. The efficiency and accuracy of our methodology are demonstrated against an exact optimization formulation. The heuristic is shown to be orders of magnitude faster, and in only 2 out of 42 cases fails to find one of the Pareto-optimal solutions found by the exact method. The inclusion of dynamic maintenance policies is shown to yield stronger and better-populated Pareto fronts, allowing more flexibility for the decision-maker. The impacts of varying parameters unique to our problem are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Mathematical programs with complementarity constraints and application to hyperparameter tuning for nonlinear support vector machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). One of the main challenges in solving this problem is the systematic failure of standard Constraint Qualifications (CQs). Carefully accounting for the combinatorial nature of the complementarity constraints, tractable versions of the Mangasarian Fromovitz Constraint Qualification (MFCQ) have been designed and widely studied in the literature. This paper looks closely at two such MPCC-MFCQs and their influence on MPCC algorithms. As a key contribution, we prove the convergence of the sequential penalisation and Scholtes relaxation algorithms under a relaxed MPCC-MFCQ that is much weaker than the CQs currently used in the literature. We then form the problem of tuning hyperparameters of a nonlinear Support Vector Machine (SVM), a fundamental machine learning problem for classification, as a MPCC. For this application, we establish that the aforementioned relaxed MPCC-MFCQ holds under a very mild assumption. Moreover, we program robust implementations and comprehensive numerical experimentation on real-world data sets, where we show that the sequential penalisation method applied to the MPCC formulation for tuning SVM hyperparameters can outperform both the Scholtes relaxation technique and the state-of-the-art derivative-free methods from the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Fast Operator Splitting Methods for Stochastic Generalized Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop two classes of variance-reduced fast operator splitting methods to approximate solutions of both finite-sum and stochastic generalized equations. Our approach integrates recent advances in accelerated fixed-point methods, co-hypomonotonicity, and variance reduction. First, we introduce a class of variance-reduced estimators and establish their variance-reduction bounds. This class covers both unbiased and biased instances and comprises common estimators as special cases, including SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD. Next, we design a novel accelerated variance-reduced forward-backward splitting (FBS) algorithm using these estimators to solve finite-sum and stochastic generalized equations. Our method achieves both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates on the expected squared norm $\mathbb{E}[ \| G_{\lambda}x^k\|^2]$ of the FBS residual $G_{\lambda}$, where $k$ is the iteration counter. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, almost sure convergence rates and almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution in stochastic accelerated methods. Unlike existing stochastic fixed-point algorithms, our methods accommodate co-hypomonotone operators, which potentially include nonmonotone problems arising from recent applications. We further specify our method to derive an appropriate variant for each stochastic estimator -- SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD -- demonstrating that they achieve the best-known complexity for each without relying on enhancement techniques. Alternatively, we propose an accelerated variance-reduced backward-forward splitting (BFS) method, which attains similar convergence rates and oracle complexity as our FBS method. Finally, we validate our results through several numerical experiments and compare their performance.</description>

      <title>An exact approach for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "avoid - shift - improve" framework and the European Clean Vehicles Directive set the path for improving the efficiency and ultimately decarbonizing the transport sector. While electric buses have already been adopted in several cities, regional bus lines may pose additional challenges due to the potentially longer distances they have to travel. In this work, we model and solve the electric bus scheduling problem, lexicographically minimizing the size of the bus fleet, the number of charging stops, and the total energy consumed, to provide decision support for bus operators planning to replace their diesel-powered fleet with zero emission vehicles. We propose a graph representation which allows partial charging without explicitly relying on time variables and derive 3-index and 2-index mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the multi-depot electric vehicle scheduling problem. While the 3-index model can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver directly, the 2-index model relies on an exponential number of constraints to ensure the correct depot pairing. These are separated in a cutting plane fashion. We propose a set of instances with up to 80 service trips to compare the two approaches, showing that, with a small number of depots, the compact 3-index model performs very well. However, as the number of depots increases the developed branch-and-cut algorithm proves to be of value. These findings not only offer algorithmic insights but the developed approaches also provide actionable guidance for transit agencies and operators, allowing to quantify trade-offs between fleet size, energy efficiency, and infrastructure needs under realistic operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Standardization of Multi-Objective QUBOs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization involving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems arises in various domains. A fundamental challenge in this context is the effective balancing of multiple objectives, each potentially operating on very different scales. This imbalance introduces complications such as the selection of appropriate weights when scalarizing multiple objectives into a single objective function. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for scaling QUBO objectives that uses an exact computation of the variance of each individual QUBO objective. By scaling each objective to have unit variance, we align all objectives onto a common scale, thereby allowing for more balanced solutions to be found when scalarizing the objectives with equal weights, as well as potentially assisting in the search or choice of weights during scalarization. Finally, we demonstrate its advantages through empirical evaluations on various multi-objective optimization problems. Our results are noteworthy since manually selecting scalarization weights is cumbersome, and reliable, efficient solutions are scarce.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent in Non-Convex Problems: Asymptotic Convergence with Relaxed Step-Size via Stopping Time Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning research. Previous convergence analyses of SGD under the vanishing step-size setting typically require Robbins-Monro conditions. However, in practice, a wider variety of step-size schemes are frequently employed, yet existing convergence results remain limited and often rely on strong assumptions. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel analytical framework based on a stopping-time method, enabling asymptotic convergence analysis of SGD under more relaxed step-size conditions and weaker assumptions. In the non-convex setting, we prove the almost sure convergence of SGD iterates for step-sizes $ \{ \epsilon_t \}_{t \geq 1} $ satisfying $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t = +\infty$ and $\sum_{t=1}^{+\infty} \epsilon_t^p &lt; +\infty$ for some $p &gt; 2$. Compared with previous studies, our analysis eliminates the global Lipschitz continuity assumption on the loss function and relaxes the boundedness requirements for higher-order moments of stochastic gradients. Building upon the almost sure convergence results, we further establish $L_2$ convergence. These significantly relaxed assumptions make our theoretical results more general, thereby enhancing their applicability in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent on Continual Linear Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function.</description>

      <title>Efficient Primal-dual Forward-backward Splitting Method for Wasserstein-like Gradient Flows with General Nonlinear Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an efficient primal-dual forward-backward (PDFB) splitting method for computing a class of minimizing movement schemes with nonlinear mobility transport distances, and apply it to computing Wasserstein-like gradient flows. This approach introduces a novel saddle point formulation for the minimizing movement schemes, leveraging a support function form from the Benamou-Brenier dynamical formulation of optimal transport. The resulting framework allows for flexible computation of Wasserstein-like gradient flows by solving the corresponding saddle point problem at the fully discrete level, and can be easily extended to handle general nonlinear mobilities. We also provide a detailed convergence analysis of the PDFB splitting method, along with practical remarks on its implementation and application. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through several challenging numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning with Gradient Tracking and Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the reliance on the server-client architecture inherent in traditional federated learning, attracting significant research interest in recent years. Simultaneously, the objective functions in machine learning tasks are often nonconvex and frequently incorporate additional, potentially nonsmooth regularization terms to satisfy practical requirements, thereby forming nonconvex composite optimization problems. Employing DFL methods to solve such general optimization problems leads to the formulation of Decentralized Nonconvex Composite Federated Learning (DNCFL), a topic that remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel DNCFL algorithm, termed \bf{DEPOSITUM}. Built upon proximal stochastic gradient tracking, DEPOSITUM mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by enabling clients to approximate the global gradient. The introduction of momentums in the proximal gradient descent step, replacing tracking variables, reduces the variance introduced by stochastic gradients. Additionally, DEPOSITUM supports local updates of client variables, significantly reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that DEPOSITUM achieves an expected $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$. The proximal gradient, consensus errors, and gradient estimation errors decrease at a sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. With appropriate parameter selection, the algorithm achieves network-independent linear speedup without requiring mega-batch sampling. Finally, we apply DEPOSITUM to the training of neural networks on real-world datasets, systematically examining the influence of various hyperparameters on its performance. Comparisons with other federated composite optimization algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Control of blow-up profiles for the mass-critical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the mass-critical focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger on bounded two-dimensional domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the absence of control, it is well-known that free solutions starting from initial data sufficiently large can blow-up. More precisely, given a finite number of points, there exists particular profiles blowing up exactly at these points at the blow-up time. For pertubations of these profiles, we show that, with the help of an appropriate nonlinear feedback law located in an open set containing the blow-up points, the blow-up can be prevented from happening. More specifically, we construct a small-time control acting just before the blow-up time. The solution may then be extended globally in time. This is the first result of control for blow-up profiles for nonlinear Schr\"odinger type equations. Assuming further a geometrical control condition on the support of the control, we are able to prove a null-controllability result for such blow-up profiles. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to three-dimensional domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach to optimize pedestrian evacuation in flood-prone historic urban areas. The model aims to minimize total evacuation cost by integrating pedestrian speed, route length, and effort, while also selecting the optimal number and position of shelters. A modified minimum cost flow formulation is used to capture complex hydrodynamic and behavioral conditions within a directed street network. The evacuation problem is modeled through an extended graph representing the urban street network, where nodes and links simulate paths and shelters, including incomplete evacuations (deadly nodes), enabling accurate representation of real-world constraints and network dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present Quantum-Inspired Model Predictive Control (QIMPC), an approach that uses Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) to learn control polices in MPC problems. The viability of the approach is tested in five experiments: A target-tracking control strategy, energy-efficient building climate control, autonomous vehicular dynamics, the simple pendulum, and the compound pendulum. Three safety guarantees were established for the approach, and the experiments gave the motivation for two important theoretical results that, in essence, identify systems for which the approach works best.</description>

      <title>A New Semidefinite Relaxation for Linear and Piecewise-Affine Optimal Control with Time Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation for optimal control of linear systems with time scaling. These problems are inherently nonconvex, since the system dynamics involves bilinear products between the discretization time step and the system state and controls. The proposed relaxation is closely related to the standard second-order semidefinite relaxation for quadratic constraints, but we carefully select a subset of the possible bilinear terms and apply a change of variables to achieve empirically tight relaxations while keeping the computational load light. We further extend our method to handle piecewise-affine (PWA) systems by formulating the PWA optimal-control problem as a shortest-path problem in a graph of convex sets (GCS). In this GCS, different paths represent different mode sequences for the PWA system, and the convex sets model the relaxed dynamics within each mode. By combining a tight convex relaxation of the GCS problem with our semidefinite relaxation with time scaling, we can solve PWA optimal-control problems through a single semidefinite program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.08907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to their local quadratic convergence. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. We present the \emph{Second-Order Conditional Gradient Sliding} (SOCGS) algorithm, which uses a projection-free algorithm to solve the constrained quadratic subproblems inexactly. When the feasible region is a polytope the algorithm converges quadratically in primal gap after a finite number of linearly convergent iterations. Once in the quadratic regime the SOCGS algorithm requires $\mathcal{O}(\log(\log 1/\varepsilon))$ first-order and Hessian oracle calls and $\mathcal{O}(\log (1/\varepsilon) \log(\log1/\varepsilon))$ linear minimization oracle calls to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution. This algorithm is useful when the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information of the function, although possible, is costly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address binary classification using neural ordinary differential equations from the perspective of simultaneous control of $N$ data points. We consider a single-neuron architecture with parameters fixed as piecewise constant functions of time. In this setting, the model complexity can be quantified by the number of control switches. Previous work has shown that classification can be achieved using a point-by-point strategy that requires $O(N)$ switches. We propose a new control method that classifies any arbitrary dataset by sequentially steering clusters of $d$ points, thereby reducing the complexity to $O(N/d)$ switches. The optimality of this result, particularly in high dimensions, is supported by some numerical experiments. Our complexity bound is sufficient but often conservative because same-class points tend to appear in larger clusters, simplifying classification. This motivates studying the probability distribution of the number of switches required. We introduce a simple control method that imposes a collinearity constraint on the parameters, and analyze a worst-case scenario where both classes have the same size and all points are i.i.d. Our results highlight the benefits of high-dimensional spaces, showing that classification using constant controls becomes more probable as $d$ increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the convergence of a family of smooth functions does not imply the convergence of its gradients. In this work, we show that if the family is definable in an o-minimal structure (for instance semialgebraic, subanalytic, or any composition of the previous with exp, log), then the gradient's limit admits a variational stratification and, under mild assumptions, is a conservative set-valued field in the sense introduced by Bolte and Pauwels. Immediate implications of this result on convergence guarantees of smoothing methods are discussed. The result is established in a general form, where the functions in the original family might be non Lipschitz continuous, be vector-valued and the gradients are replaced by their Clarke Jacobians or an arbitrary mapping satisfying a definable variational stratification. In passing, we investigate various stability properties of definable variational stratifications which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical framework to verify the finite step convergence of first-order methods for parametric convex quadratic optimization. We formulate the verification problem as a mathematical optimization problem where we maximize a performance metric (e.g., fixed-point residual at the last iteration) subject to constraints representing proximal algorithm steps (e.g., linear system solutions, projections, or gradient steps). Our framework is highly modular because we encode a wide range of proximal algorithms as variations of two primitive steps: affine steps and element-wise maximum steps. Compared to standard convergence analysis and performance estimation techniques, we can explicitly quantify the effects of warm-starting by directly representing the sets where the initial iterates and parameters live. We show that the verification problem is NP-hard, and we construct strong semidefinite programming relaxations using various constraint tightening techniques. Numerical examples in nonnegative least squares, network utility maximization, Lasso, and optimal control show a significant reduction in pessimism of our framework compared to standard worst-case convergence analysis techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore several approaches for sampling weight vectors in the context of weighted sum scalarisation approaches for solving multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. This established method converts a multi-objective problem into a (single) scalar optimisation problem. It does so by assigning weights to each objective. We outline various methods to select these weights, with a focus on ensuring computational efficiency and avoiding redundancy. The challenges and computational complexity of these approaches are explored and numerical examples are provided. The theoretical results demonstrate the trade-offs between systematic and randomised weight generation techniques, highlighting their performance for different problem settings. These sampling approaches will be tested and compared computationally in an upcoming paper.</description>

      <title>On the completeness of several fortification-interdiction games in the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fortification-interdiction games are tri-level adversarial games where two opponents act in succession to protect, disrupt and simply use an infrastructure for a specific purpose. Many such games have been formulated and tackled in the literature through specific algorithmic methods, however very few investigations exist on the completeness of such fortification problems in order to locate them rigorously in the polynomial hierarchy. We clarify the completeness status of several well-known fortification problems, such as the Tri-level Interdiction Knapsack Problem with unit fortification and attack weights, the Max-flow Interdiction Problem and Shortest Path Interdiction Problem with Fortification, the Multi-level Critical Node Problem with unit weights, as well as a well-studied electric grid defence planning problem. For all of these problems, we prove their completeness either for the $\Sigma^p_2$ or the $\Sigma^p_3$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. We also prove that the Multi-level Fortification-Interdiction Knapsack Problem with an arbitrary number of protection and interdiction rounds and unit fortification and attack weights is complete for any level of the polynomial hierarchy, therefore providing a useful basis for further attempts at proving the completeness of protection-interdiction games at any level of said hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We study a problem of optimal irreversible investment and emission reduction formulated as a nonzero-sum dynamic game between an investor with environmental preferences and a firm. The game is set in continuous time on an infinite-time horizon. The firm generates profits with a stochastic dynamics and may spend part of its revenues towards emission reduction (e.g., renovating the infrastructure). The firm's objective is to maximize the discounted expectation of a function of its profits. The investor participates in the profits, may decide to invest to support the firm's production capacity and uses a profit function which accounts for both financial and environmental factors. Nash equilibria of the game are obtained via a system of variational inequalities. We formulate a general verification theorem for this system in a diffusive setup and construct an explicit solution in the zero-noise limit. Our explicit results and numerical approximations show that both the investor's and the firm's optimal actions are triggered by moving boundaries that increase with the total amount of emission abatement.</description>

      <title>Which Optimizer Works Best for Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have revolutionized the computation of PDE solutions by integrating partial differential equations (PDEs) into the neural network's training process as soft constraints, becoming an important component of the scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem. More recently, physics-informed Kolmogorv-Arnold networks (PIKANs) have also shown to be effective and comparable in accuracy with PINNs. In their current implementation, both PINNs and PIKANs are mainly optimized using first-order methods like Adam, as well as quasi-Newton methods such as BFGS and its low-memory variant, L-BFGS. However, these optimizers often struggle with highly non-linear and non-convex loss landscapes, leading to challenges such as slow convergence, local minima entrapment, and (non)degenerate saddle points. In this study, we investigate the performance of Self-Scaled BFGS (SSBFGS), Self-Scaled Broyden (SSBroyden) methods and other advanced quasi-Newton schemes, including BFGS and L-BFGS with different line search strategies approaches. These methods dynamically rescale updates based on historical gradient information, thus enhancing training efficiency and accuracy. We systematically compare these optimizers -- using both PINNs and PIKANs -- on key challenging linear, stiff, multi-scale and non-linear PDEs, including the Burgers, Allen-Cahn, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Ginzburg-Landau equations. Our findings provide state-of-the-art results with orders-of-magnitude accuracy improvements without the use of adaptive weights or any other enhancements typically employed in PINNs. More broadly, our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of second-order optimization strategies in significantly improving the convergence and accurate generalization of PINNs and PIKANs.</description>

      <title>Transferable Foundation Models for Geometric Tasks on Point Cloud Representations: Geometric Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce methods for obtaining pretrained Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) that can serve as basal foundation models for use in obtaining geometric features. These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We release codes and weights for using GNPs in the package geo_neural_op. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Battery Storage Profits via High-Frequency Intraday Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</description>
