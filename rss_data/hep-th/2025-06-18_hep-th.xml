      <title>Dyon Loops and Abelian Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Abelian gauge field configurations that carry non-zero instanton number. Each such "Abelian instanton" is generated by a closed magnetic worldline in four-dimensional Euclidean space, provided the Abelian gauge field has non-trivial winding along the closed worldline. The resulting field configuration corresponds to a Euclidean dyon loop featuring non-zero instanton number. We embed these dyon loops in a UV-complete theory using the Georgi-Glashow model and show that the full instanton charge is borne entirely by the unbroken $U(1)$ sector. In this same model, using a numerical relaxation procedure, we show that Euclidean dyon loops are a continuous deformation of small BPST instantons.</description>

      <title>Micro Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions at Unusual Values of $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the $\theta$ dependence in a cousin of QCD, where the vacuum structure can be analyzed exactly. The theory is $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_F=0,1,2,3$ flavors of fundamentals, explicitly broken to $\mathcal{N}=1$ via an adjoint superpotential, and coupled to anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB). The hierarchy $m_{AMSB}\ll \mu_{\mathcal{N}=1}\ll \Lambda$ ensures the validity of our IR analysis. As expected from ordinary QCD, the vacuum energy is a function of $\theta$ which undergoes 1st order phase transitions between different vacua where the various dyons condense. For $N_F=0$ we find the expected phase transition at $\theta=\pi$, while for $N_F=1,2,3$ we find phase transitions at fractional values of $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Can weak-gravity, causality-violation arguments constrain modified gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate limitations of causality arguments from flat-spacetime amplitudes, based on the eikonal limit of gravitational scattering, to place constraints on modified gravity. We show that causality constraints are only valid in the weak-gravity regime even for transplanckian scattering, and that such constraints are much less stringent than astrophysical ones, obtained for example from gravitational waves emitted in black hole coalescence. Special attention is given to the weakness of causality constraints on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, but our results apply to other modified gravity theories as well. In the context of that theory, we also discuss how to obtain a time-delay formula from black hole, neutron stars, and shockwave solutions. For scattering with compact objects, we explicitly show that time delays are greatly suppressed by the ratio of the object's mass to the impact parameter, so time advances only occur greatly outside the cut off of the theory. For the shockwave solution, we find that the time delay is always positive within the regime of validity of the solution. We also comment on the impact of graviton nonlinearities for time-delay calculations in the nonlinear, strong gravity regime. We conclude that amplitude-based causality constraints on modified gravity are typically not stringent relative to other experimental and observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet CFT$_2$ and Celestial CFT$_2$ : An AdS$_3$-CFT$_2$ perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial CFT$_d$ is the putative dual of quantum gravity in asymptotically flat $(d+2)$ dimensional space time. We argue that a class of Celestial CFT$_d$ can be engineered via AdS$_{d+1}$-CFT$_d$ correspondence. Our argument is based on the observation that if we zoom in near the boundary of (Euclidean) AdS$_{d+1}$ then the conformal isometry group of EAdS$_{d+1}$, which is SO$(d+2,1)$, contracts to the Poincare group ISO$(d+1,1)$. This suggests that the near boundary scaling limit of a theory of \textit{conformal} gravity on EAdS$_{d+1}$ should be dual to a boundary CFT$_d$ with ISO$(d+1,1)$ symmetry. This dual CFT$_d$, since the symmetries match, is an example of a Celestial CFT$_d$. Similarly, if we have a \textit{non-conformal} theory of gravity on EAdS$_{d+1}$ then the near boundary scaling limit of such a theory is dual to a (boundary) Celestial CFT$_d$ with \textit{only} (SO$(d+1,1)$) Lorentz invariance. Celestial CFTs with only Lorentz invariance have been recently studied in the literature. Now following this logic we discuss, among other things, the near boundary scaling limit of the bosonic string theory on Euclidean AdS$_3$ in the presence of the NS-NS B field. The AdS$_3$ part of the worldsheet theory is free in this limit and has been studied in the literature in different contexts. This limit describes a ``long string'' which wraps the (Euclidean) AdS$_3$ boundary and it has been argued that the space-time CFT$_2$ which describes the radial fluctuations of a long string is a Liouville CFT. According to our proposal, the dual CFT$_2$ which describes the \textit{long string sector} is an example of a \textit{Celestial} CFT$_2$ with \textit{only} (SO$(3,1)$)Lorentz invariance. We do not get a full ISO$(3,1)$ invariant Celestial CFT$_2$ in this way because the string theory does not have target space conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Free real scalar CFT on fuzzy sphere: spectrum, algebra and wavefunction ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple model to realize the free real scalar CFT on the fuzzy sphere. The model is structurally similar to the original model that realizes the 3D Ising CFT on the fuzzy sphere. Owing to the shift symmetry of the free scalar, the free scalar CFT fixed point in our model can be accessed with only a single tuning parameter-the conformal coupling. We numerically demonstrate that our model correctly reproduces the operator spectrum, correlation functions, and, crucially, the harmonic oscillator algebra of the real scalar CFT. We also examine the fuzzy sphere algebra, a generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, and discuss its potential implications for defining quantum field theories on non-commutative geometries. Finally, we propose wavefunction ansatz for the ground states of both the free scalar and Ising CFTs, which exhibit remarkable agreement with the CFT ground state wavefunctions of the fuzzy sphere model. For instance, the wavefunction overlap between our Ising ansatz and the Ising CFT ground state exceeds $0.99$ for $N=28$ fermions, suggesting a promising direction for tackling the 3D Ising CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is long known that A-series minimal models and D-series minimal models are exchanged by gauging the invertible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. More recently, it has been shown that A-series minimal models and E-series minimal models are exchanged by gauging a non-invertible symmetry. We complete the triality picture by showing that D-series minimal models and E-series minimal models are exchanged by gauging another non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Classical analog of the T. D. Lee model for renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While divergence and renormalization of physical quantities are frequently encountered in quantum field theory (QFT), they are not necessarily quantum-specific characteristics. We show in this paper that there exists a classical counterpart of the Lee model which is the model of coupled harmonic oscillators (CHO). It is demonstrated that the frequency divergence in this classical model precisely replicates the phenomenon of mass divergence in the Lee model, as does the corresponding renormalization procedure. Considering the arbitrariness in renormalization schemes, we establish necessary conditions that a general renormalization must satisfy for the model of two coupled oscillators which corresponds to the single-mode Lee model. Furthermore, we analyze the classical analog of $N\text{-}\theta$ scattering process and show that the dependence of scattering strength on the cutoff mode mirrors that of the quantum case. These findings challenge the quantum-centric view of mass renormalization in the Lee model and offer new insights into the classical-quantum correspondence in renormalization theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected black hole thermodynamics from the gravitational path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring quantum effects from black hole thermodynamics has always been a pivotal topic. In recent years, the free energy landscape and ensemble-averaged theory based on the Euclidean path integral approach have provided further understanding of the statistical aspects of the black hole system. We investigate the quantum-corrected thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole by including off-shell geometries in the path integral. We obtain a one-loop effective action by considering the subleading-order terms in the ensemble-averaged theory, and verify that the effective thermodynamic quantities consistent with the effective action define a valid thermodynamics. Furthermore, the phase diagram was modified by the off-shell effects, resulting in a more abundant phase structure. We discover that the traditional black hole thermodynamics can be recovered in the semi-classical limit. The region of first-order phase transitions shrinks and zero-order phase transitions emerge when off-shell effects are included. The results provide new perspectives for understanding the quantum corrections in black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a summary of discussions at the recent ITEP-JINR-YerPhI workshop on Vogel theory in Dubna. We consider relation between Vogel divisor(s) and the old Dynkin classification of simple Lie algebras. We consider application to knot theory and the hidden role of Jacobi identities in the definition/invariance of Kontsevich integral, which is the knot polynomial with the values in diagrams, capable of revealing all Vassiliev invariants -- including the ones, not visible in other approaches. Finally we comment on the possible breakdown of Vogel universality after the Jack/Macdonald deformation. Generalizations to affine, Yangian and DIM algebras are also mentioned. Especially interesting could be the search for universality in ordinary Yang-Mills theory and its interference with confinement phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exact results on the Bethe Ansatz evaluation of the SCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the superconformal index using the Bethe Ansatz (BA) approach for 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ toric quiver gauge theories with a small amount of gauge groups. We restrict to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge factors and compare the results with the ones obtained by a direct evaluation of the index. The answer obtained from the BA approach using only discrete solutions for the BA equations does not always reproduce the direct evaluation result. A similar problem affects the case of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM for $N \geq 3$, and it requires to introduce continuous solutions to the BA equations. However, we find that for $T^{1,1}$ and partially for the suspended pinch point the matching is exact in absence of the contributions from continuous solutions.</description>

      <title>All zeros of (super)String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the zeros of string theory utilizing its curve-integral representation. Firstly, we note that for bosonic strings the tachyon amplitude in curve-representation is identical to the kinematic shifted Tr$\phi^3$ amplitude. Scaffolding is then equivalent to taking the OPE limit of vertex operators on the string world-sheet, which yields amplitude of higher excitations. Using this picture, we derive that the $n$-point level-$N$ scattering amplitude shares the same set of zeros as the $n$-point tachyon amplitude as well as those inherited from it's prescaffold image, i.e. $(2^N)n$-point. Doing the same for the super-tachyon amplitude, exposes new zeros for the open super-string, which can be viewed as the avatar of supersymmetry. Finally we also consider the gluino amplitude at four and six-points, identifying its zero and recovering super-Yang-Mills via scaffolding. Finally we consider the field theory limit of colored fermion amplitudes from the curve-integral form.</description>

      <title>Entanglement through high-energy scattering in noncommutative quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the tree-level generation of entanglement through some key scattering processes in massless quantum electrodynamics on canonical noncomutative spacetime with space-space type of noncommutativity. The fermions in the noncommutative theory will be zero charge fermions. The scattering processes we shall study do not occur in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. We shall use the concurrence to characterize the amount of entanglement generated through a given scattering process. We shall show that, at tree-level, the concurrence for the scattering of two photons of opposite helicity is given by the same expression as in the case of the scattering of gluons in ordinary Minkowski spacetime. Thus, maximal entanglement is achieved if and only if the polar scattering angle is equal to $\pi/2$. We also compute the concurrence for the head-on collision in the laboratory reference frame of two fermions of opposite helicity to obtain the same result as in the case of photon scattering. Finally, we shall study a type of collision at right angles in the laboratory frame of fermions with opposite helicity. We show that in the latter case the concurrence depends on energy of the incoming fermions, the noncommutativity matrix $\theta^{ij}$, the polar, $\theta$, and azimuth angle, $\phi$, of the zero-momentum frame of the incoming fermions. In this latter case we see that when $\theta=\pi/2$ there are values of $\phi$ for which no entanglement is generated.</description>

      <title>Null infinity as an inverted extremal horizon: Matching an infinite set of conserved quantities for gravitational perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every spacetime that is asymptotically flat near null infinity can be conformally mapped via a spatial inversion onto the geometry around an extremal, non-rotating and non-expanding horizon. We set up a dictionary for this geometric duality, connecting the geometry and physics near null infinity to those near the dual horizon. We then study its physical implications for conserved quantities for extremal black holes, extending previously known results to the case of gravitational perturbations. In particular, we derive a tower of near-horizon gravitational charges that are exactly conserved and show their one-to-one matching with Newman-Penrose conserved quantities associated with gravitational perturbations of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole geometry. We furthermore demonstrate the physical relevance of spatial inversions for extremal Kerr-Newman black holes, even if the latter are notoriously not conformally isometric under such inversions.</description>

Abstract: We continue the approach of [1] to attempt to reproduce the classical electromagnetic current of the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution from the infinite-spin limit of a three-point amplitude with two higher-spin string states and a massless vector. We review the infinite-spin limit of three-point amplitudes along the leading Regge trajectory, which differ from $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$, and we provide evidence that any sub-leading trajectory parallel to the leading one give the same result. We extend the above investigation to the simplest sub-leading trajectory not parallel to the leading one, containing physical states with the first two harmonics. We compute all three-point amplitudes involving two such states and a massless vector, using both covariant and DDF formalism, and we extract the associated classical infinite-spin limit. Inspired by the leading Regge case, where this limit reproduces the classical electromagnetic current sourced by a rigid rotating string, we derive new classical string solutions containing the first two harmonics and compare the currents they source to the infinite-spin amplitude of the two-harmonic state. We do not see a matching between the two approaches, and we find that the classical behaviour is instead reproduced by the amplitude involving coherent string states. We conclude this paper by discussing common patterns between the different amplitudes we considered, and we conjecture how they can be generalised to reproduce $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlators at finite density and temperature encode important information about a physical system, such as transport and causality. For a massive gas of particles in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory, we provide complete analytic results for all first order transport coefficients, including thermoelectric coefficients. We demonstrate the first complete picture of the complex structure of the correlators as a function of mass, providing an interpretation in terms of the causal structure of lightcones. We provide a simple criterion to extract the effective lightcone velocity from the cut of the retarded correlator.</description>

      <title>Soft Factorisation and Exponentiation from Schwinger-Space Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared divergences in Quantum Field Theory govern the low-energy dynamics of many physical theories, and their understanding is a crucial ingredient in predicting the outcomes of collider experiments. We present a novel approach to deriving the structure of these divergences by employing the Schwinger parametrization of Feynman integrals. After using tropical geometry to identify divergent limits, we study the all-orders asymptotic properties of Feynman diagrams via matrix manipulations of graph Laplacians, which allows us to analyse their IR behaviour systematically. We explicitly demonstrate the soft-hard factorization of the integrand for a broad class of diagrams, and reveal that when written in terms of "worldline distances", topologically distinct diagrams asymptote to the same integrand. In particular, for the case of Quantum Electrodynamics, we use this fact to show how ladder-type diagrams combine in Schwinger-parameter space to yield the correct exponentiated soft anomalous dimension. This framework provides a foundation for extending these methods to more complex theories like Quantum Chromodynamics and offers a pathway towards a systematic understanding of infrared divergences in perturbative amplitudes.</description>

      <title>On the generalized Komar charge of Kaluza-Klein theories and higher-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Komar $(d-2)$-form charge can be modified by the addition of any other on-shell closed (conserved) $(d-2)$-form charge. We show that, with Kaluza--Klein boundary conditions, one has to add a charge related to the higher-form symmetry identified in Ref.~\cite{Gomez-Fayren:2024cpl} to the naive Komar charge of pure 5-dimensional gravity to obtain a conserved charge charge whose integral at spatial infinity gives the mass. The new term also contains the contribution of the Kaluza--Klein monopole charge leading to electric-magnetic duality invariance.</description>

      <title>A universal W-algebra for N=4 super Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using bootstrap methods, we provide evidence for the existence of a non-linear W-algebra, denoted $W_\infty^\text{s,s}$, which contains the small N= 4 super Virasoro algebra and features an infinite tower of additional generators, organized in short supersymmetry multiplets. The algebra $W_\infty^\text{s,s}$ has one free parameter, its central charge c. We claim that the simple quotient of $W_\infty^\text{s,s}$ for c= -3(N^2-1) is isomorphic to the vertex operator algebra associated to 4d N=4 $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory. We define a filtration in $W_\infty^\text{s,s}$ and provide evidence that it reproduces the R-filtration, which is crucial to extract 4d SCFT data from the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we present explicit formulae for all the (anti)commutators of the wedge algebra of $ W_\infty^\text{s,s}$.</description>

      <title>Many-faced Painlev\'e I: irregular conformal blocks, topological recursion, and holomorphic anomaly approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the Fourier series (Zak transform) structure of the Painlev\'e I tau function has emerged in multiple contexts. Its main building block admits several conjectural interpretations, such as the partition function of an Argyres-Douglas gauge theory, the topological recursion partition function for the Weierstrass elliptic curve, and a 1-point conformal block on the Riemann sphere with an irregular insertion of rank $\frac52$. We review and further develop a mathematical framework for these constructions, and formulate conjectures on their equivalence. In particular, we give a simple explanation of the Fourier series representation of the tau function based on the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential extended to the space of Stokes data. We provide an algebraic construction of the rank $\frac52$ Whittaker state for the Virasoro algebra embedded into a rank $2$ Whittaker module, prove its existence and uniqueness, and fix its descendant structure. We also prove the conifold gap property of the relevant topological recursion partition function, which, on one hand, enables its efficient computation within the holomorphic anomaly approach and, on the other, establishes the existence of solution for the latter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit well-established mechanisms for primordial black hole (PBH) production, namely inflation, phase transitions, and cosmic strings, in the context of the Dark Dimension Scenario, which is motivated by Swampland principles. Applying quantum gravity constraints, we demonstrate that any viable mechanism, barring exotic new physics at low energies, inevitably leads to the formation of five-dimensional PBHs. We further show that PBHs formed from cosmic strings can have lifetimes comparable to the age of the universe. We comment on the observational implications of this result, including a potential connection to the recent detection of a high-energy neutrino by KM3NeT, whose energy is intriguingly close to the five-dimensional Planck scale in the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Regular Vaidya solutions of effective gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity through exact solutions of the field equations of second-order effective gravitational theories defined solely in terms of the symmetries of the problem in 4 or more dimensions. We prove the existence of regular Vaidya solutions that represent the formation or change in mass of regular black holes (or black hole mimickers) due to the gravitational collapse or accretion of radiation, with the time-reverse of these processes being also included as solutions. Our treatment and results are remarkable in their simplicity and the possibilities they provide for novel theoretical applications and discoveries in the context of regular gravitational collapse. For instance, we illustrate how modifications of the gravitational dynamics can cure curvature singularities through what can be interpreted as an energy transfer between matter and gravitational degrees of freedom. As another application, we show how to incorporate spacetimes frequently used in the literature, designed geometrically to represent the formation and disappearance of regular black holes, as fully dynamical solutions within this formalism.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Constant from a Quantum Gravitational $\theta$-Vacua and the Gravitational Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the cosmological constant by exploring the background-independent Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of general relativity. The Chern-Simons-Kodama state of quantum gravity, a generalization of the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin states, has a striking structural similarity to the topological field theory of the quantum Hall effect. As a result, we study the gravitational topological $\theta$-sectors in analogy to Yang-Mills theory. We find that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is intimately linked to the $\theta$-parameter by $\theta=12\pi^2/(\Lambda \ell^2_{\rm Pl}) \mod 2\pi$ due to the fact that Chern-Simons-Kodama state must live in a particular $\theta$-sector. This result is shown in the canonical, non-perturbative formalism. Furthermore, we explain how the physics of the Hamiltonian constraint is analogous to the quantum Hall effect, with the cosmological constant playing the role of a quantum gravitational Hall resistivity. These relations suggest that $\Lambda$ is topologically protected against perturbative graviton loop corrections, analogous to the robustness of quantized Hall conductance against disorder in a metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of Regge trajectories in the context of quantum field theory at finite temperature. For this purpose, we employ the $\lambda \phi^3$ model. We first compute the Regge trajectories at zero temperature, establishing a baseline for comparison. As a key novelty, we extended our analysis to finite temperature and derive an analytical expression for the Regge trajectories in this regime. We explore how temperature modifies the structure of the Regge trajectories and analyze the physical implications of these modifications, which arise from the resummation of thermal ladder diagrams. As an interesting consequence, we find the thermal evolution of masses belonging to different Regge trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of thermalization in a quantum field-theoretic model mimicking the production of jets in QCD -- the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. Specifically, we compute the expectation values of local operators as functions of time and compare them to their thermal counterparts, quantify the overlap between the evolving density matrix and the thermal one, and compare the dynamics of the energy-momentum tensor to predictions from relativistic hydrodynamics. Through these studies, we find that the system approaches thermalization at late times and elucidate the mechanisms by which quantum entanglement drives thermalization in closed field-theoretic systems. Our results show how thermodynamic behavior emerges in real time from unitary quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings in Multi-Step Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmic strings arising from a hierarchical gauge symmetry breaking sequence, $\mathrm{SU}(2) \times \mathrm{U}(1) \rightarrow \mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{U}(1) \rightarrow \mathrm{U}(1)' \rightarrow \text{Nothing}$. This pattern gives rise to two distinct classes of cosmic strings: light, stable strings formed at a later stage, and heavy, metastable strings originating from an earlier stage. Our focus is on the heavy strings, which may decay either before or after the final $\mathrm{U}(1)'$ symmetry is broken. We analyze the internal structure of these strings and the magnetic flux sourced by monopole-like configurations that emerge at the endpoints of metastable string segments following their decay. Understanding the nature of the magnetic $\mathrm{U}(1)$ fluxes associated with these monopole-like objects is crucial for studying the post-decay evolution of the string network. The post-decay evolution influences the resulting gravitational wave signals. We show that the magnetic flux carried by string segments can be either confined or unconfined, depending on the specific sequence of symmetry breaking and string decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an equation of state describing cold and dense matter in the core of neutron stars which includes an admixture of fermionic dark matter and incorporates nucleon effective masses derived from the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) many-body approach within a relativistic mean-field model. Such a BHF-informed mixed-model approach increases stellar compactness, with mass-radius configurations which are consistent with smaller, lighter pulsars. The model displays the expected non-monotonic behavior of sound speed hinted at by neutron star data, and is closer to the conformal bound at maximum mass. We find that the model displays tension with bounds on heavier pulsars, suggesting that the hypothesis of an aggregated dark component in neutron stars needs further critical study.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ factorization does not hold for arbitrary multi-trace observables in random tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider real tensors of order $D$, that is $D$-dimensional arrays of real numbers $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$, where each index $a^c$ can take $N$ values. The tensor entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ have no symmetry properties under permutations of the indices. The invariant polynomials built out of the tensor entries are called trace invariants.
  We prove that for a Gaussian random tensor with $D\ge 3$ indices (that is such that the entries $T_{a^1a^2 \dots a^D}$ are independent identically distributed Gaussian random variables) the cumulant, or connected expectation, of a product of trace invariants is not always suppressed in scaling in $N$ with respect to the product of the expectations of the individual invariants. Said otherwise, not all the multi-trace expectations factor at large $N$ in terms of the single-trace ones and the Gaussian scaling is not subadditive on the connected components. This is in stark contrast to the $D=2$ case of random matrices in which the multi-trace expectations always factor at large $N$. The best one can do for $D\ge 3$ is to identify restricted families of invariants for which the large $N$ factorization holds and we check that this indeed happens when restricting to the family of melonic observables, the dominant family in the large $N$ limit.</description>

Abstract: We consider the three-loop mixed strong-electroweak (${\mathcal{O}}(\alpha \alpha_s^2)$) corrections to the quark form factor. We compute the master integrals which are appearing in the Feynman diagrams containing a single massive boson in the loop. We use the state-of-the-art method of differential equations to compute all 303 of them, expressing the results in terms of generalized polylogarithms. We encounter multiple square roots that cannot be simultaneously rationalized using a single transformation. Applying concurrent transformations allows us to express the results through generalized polylogarithms with a simple alphabet, but with multiple interdependent arguments.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cosmic structure from Planckian discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard inflationary paradigm the inhomogeneities observed in the CMB arise from quantum fluctuations of an initially homogeneous and isotropic vacuum state. This picture suffers from two well-known weaknesses. First, it assumes that quantum field theory remains valid at trans-Planckian scales, without modifications from quantum gravity. Second, it necessitates a quantum-to-classical transition in which fluctuations of a homogeneous quantum state become the classical inhomogeneities seen in the CMB. Recently, an alternative paradigm has been proposed in which such inhomogeneities are present from the very beginning, emerging from the assumed discreteness of spacetime at the Planck scale predicted by certain approaches to quantum gravity. Within this framework, scale-invariant scalar perturbations are generated naturally, without relying on trans-Planckian assumptions or invoking a quantum-to-classical transition. Specifically, inhomogeneities in the quantum state at the Planck scale propagate into semiclassical inhomogeneities on CMB scales. Here, we extend the aforementioned proposal to the most realistic case of a quasi-de Sitter expansion; in particular, we compute the scalar perturbation spectrum as a function of the slow-roll parameters, systematically encoded through the Hubble flow functions.</description>

      <title>Covariant odd entanglement entropy in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance a covariant construction for the holographic odd entanglement entropy (OEE) of time dependent bipartite states in CFT$_2$s dual to bulk AdS$_3$ geometries. In this context we obtain the OEE for bipartite states in zero, finite temperature and finite size CFT$_2$s dual to bulk pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ black hole geometries through appropriate replica techniques. The replica technique results for the time dependent OEE are reproduced modulo constants in the large central charge limit through holographic computations involving the bulk entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS). Subsequently we obtain the time dependent OEE for bipartite states in zero and finite temperature CFT$_2$s with a conserved charge dual to bulk extremal and non-extremal rotating BTZ black holes through both field theory and covariant holographic computations which again match up to constants in the large central charge limit.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models from non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the study of non-invertible symmetries, we propose there exist infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(kq + I, q) \to\mathcal{M}(kq-I, q)$ induced by $\phi_{(1,2k+1)}$. They vastly generalize the previously proposed ones $k=I=1$ by Zamolodchikov, $k=1, I&gt;1$ by Ahn and L\"assig, and $k=2$ by Dorey et al. All the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the literature (e.g. $\mathcal{M}(10,3) \to \mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov et al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a complete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$ fusion ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the duality group for $\mathcal N=2$ $\widehat{A}_n$-shaped quivers SCFTs and generalize it to the previously unexplored case of $\widehat{D}_n$-shaped quivers. We then provide a systematic description of non-invertible duality symmetries in both classes. Furthermore, we characterize the $\mathcal N=1$ mass deformations of these theories that preserve such symmetries, thereby identifying a large class of $\mathcal N=1$ SCFTs with non-invertible duality symmetries inherited from their parent $\mathcal N=2$ theories.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a path integral representation
  of the time evolution $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)$ for Lagrangians of the variable $A$ which can be represented in the form (quadratic in $Q$) ${\cal L}(A)=\frac{1}{2}Q(A){\cal M}Q(A)+\partial_{\mu}L^{\mu}$. We show that
  $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0}) =\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ up to an $A$-independent factor. We discuss examples of the states $\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory (the Chern-Simons states in Yang-Mills theory, Kodama states in quantum gravity). We show the relevance of these states for a determination of the dynamics in terms of stochastic perturbations of self-duality equations. The solution of the Schr\"odinger equation can be expressed by the solution of the self-duality equation in the leading order of $\hbar$ expansion. We discuss applications to gauge theory on a Lorentzian manifold and gauge theories of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of hidden zeros in particle and string amplitudes, we characterize zeros of individual graph contributions to the cosmological wavefunction of a scalar field theory. We demonstrate that these contributions factorize near these zeros for all tree graphs and provide evidence that this extends to loop graphs as well. We explicitly construct polytopal realizations of the relevant graph associahedra and show that the cosmological zeros have natural geometric and physical interpretations. As a byproduct, we establish an equivalence between the wavefunction coefficients of chain graphs and flat-space Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes, enabling us to leverage the cosmological zeros to uncover the recently discovered hidden zeros of colored amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>1-loop renormalisability of integrable sigma-models from 4d Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large families of integrable 2d sigma-models have been constructed at the classical level, partly motivated by the utility of integrability on the string worldsheet. It is natural to ask whether these theories are renormalisable at the quantum level, and whether they define quantum integrable field theories. By considering examples, a folk theorem has emerged: the classically integrable sigma-models always turn out to be renormalisable, at least at 1-loop order. We prove this theorem for a large class of models engineered on surface defects in the 4d Chern-Simons theory by Costello and Yamazaki. We derive the flow of the 'twist 1-form' (a 4d coupling constant that distinguishes different 2d models), proving earlier conjectures and extending previous results. Our approach is general, using the 'universal' form of 2d integrable models' UV divergences in terms of their Lax connection and reinterpreting the result in the language of 4d Chern-Simons. These results apply equally to rational, trigonometric and elliptic models.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new off-shell formulation for six-dimensional conformal supergravity obtained by gauging the 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal algebra in superspace. We provide the complete gauged algebra, which proves to be considerably constrained compared to other conformal superspaces constructed in the past. This formulation is employed to obtain the unique 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ Bach tensor superfield, which describes the multiplet of equations of motions for conformal supergravity, by using a general ansatz fixed by truncation to 6D $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ results. We also translate some results into components for precise matching against the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest DESI DR2 results, when combined with other independent cosmological data on the Cosmic Microwave Background and supernovas, suggest a preference for dynamical dark energy.
  We propose a novel cosmological scenario, which features two distinct scalar fields. One governs the magnitude of the present-day dark energy density and is related to the size of extra-dimensions. Accounting for the observed smallness of this energy density requires the scalar to reside near the boundary of field space.
  The second field, responsible for the time evolution of dark energy and associated with the string coupling, must instead lie in the bulk to remain consistent with the non-observation of light string states. We show that a natural candidate for such dark energy dynamics is a quintessence modular-invariant potential, in which the second scalar field rolls down a negatively curved slope, starting from a self-dual critical point. We find that this scenario is in good agreement with the latest findings by DESI.</description>

Abstract: Taking a representation-theoretic viewpoint, we construct a continuous associahedron motivated by the realization of the generalized associahedron in the physical setting. We show that our associahedron shares important properties with the generalized associahedron of type A. Our continuous associahedron is convex and manifests a cluster theory: the points which correspond to the clusters are on its boundary, and the edges that correspond to mutations are given by intersections of hyperplanes. This requires development of several methods that are continuous analogues of discrete methods. We conclude the paper by showing that there is a sequence of embeddings of type A generalized associahedra into our continuous associahedron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A limiting case is considered in which the causal action principle for causal fermion systems describing Minkowski space gives rise to the linear Fock space dynamics of quantum electrodynamics. The quantum nature of the bosonic field is a consequence of the stochastic description of a multitude of fluctuating fields coupled to non-commuting operators, taking into account dephasing effects. The scaling of all error terms is specified. Our analysis leads to the concept of holographic mixing, which is introduced and explained in detail.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>

Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal Modes of Rotating Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390</link>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes are characteristic signatures of compact objects. Here we consider rotating regular black holes, representing rotating generalizations of the Simpson and Visser metric. We present the spectrum of scalar quasinormal modes and compare it with the spectrum of Kerr black holes. The calculations are done using a spectral decomposition method. The scalar modes smoothly connect to the Kerr limit. Interestingly, for particularly low scaled Hawking temperatures, the dependence of the modes changes as rotation increases. A further investigation shows that the real part of the fundamental and first excited modes of the static and slowly rotating black holes (about $13\%$ of the extremal angular momentum) progresses in an opposite behavior in this low temperature region. Meanwhile the imaginary part of the modes crosses where the excited modes become longer lived than the fundamental modes. Rapid rotation however suppresses such tendency.</description>

      <title>'t Hooft line in 4D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory and a microscopic description of dyon's statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lattice gauge theory with compact gauge field variables, an introduction of the gauge field topology requires the assumption that lattice field configurations are sufficiently smooth. This assumption is referred to as the admissibility condition. However, the admissibility condition always ensures the Bianchi identity, and thus prohibits the existence of magnetic objects such as the 't~Hooft line. Recently, in 2D compact scalar field theory, Ref.~\cite{Abe:2023uan} proposed a method to define magnetic objects without violating the admissibility condition by introducing holes into the lattice. In this paper, we extend this ``excision method'' to 4D Maxwell theory and propose a new definition of the 't~Hooft line on the lattice. Using this definition, we first demonstrate a lattice counterpart of the Witten effect which endows the 't~Hooft line with electric charge and make it a dyon. Furthermore, we show that by interpreting the 't~Hooft line as a boundary of the lattice system, the statistics of the dyon can be directly read off. We also explain how the dyonic operator which satisfies the Dirac quantization condition becomes a genuine loop operator even at finite lattice spacings.</description>
