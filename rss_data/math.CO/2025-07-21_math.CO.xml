      <title>Fair distribution of bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of splitting fairly bundles of items. We show that given $n$ bundles with $m$ kinds of items in them, it is possible to distribute the value of each kind of item fairly among $r$ persons by breaking apart at most $(r-1)m$ bundles. Moreover, we can guarantee that each participant will receive roughly $n/r - mr/2$ full bundles. The proof methods are topological and use a modified form of the configuration space/test map scheme. We obtain optimal results when $r$ is a power of two.</description>

      <title>Clasificaci\'on por 2-switch-degree de grafos split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2-switch-degree of $G$ is the number of distinct 2-switches acting on a graph $G$. In this work we study structural properties of the 2-switch-degree, with a focus on split graphs. Our approach is motivated by the Tyshkevich decomposition, which uniquely expresses any graph as a composition $G_r \circ \ldots \circ G_1$ of irreducible graphs, where $G_2, \ldots, G_r$ are split. Our key tool is the factor graph $\Phi(S)$, a multigraph associated with a split graph $S$ that encodes 2-switch-degree information via edge multiplicities between independet vertices of $S$. By leveraging $\Phi(S)$, we reduce the problem of classifying irreducible split graphs to enumerating and analyzing unlabeled connected multigraphs of fixed size. Using this method, we fully classify irreducible split graphs of degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4. Further, we introduce and investigate the $\Delta$-property, a surprising connection between Graph Theory and Number Theory that arises from $n$-simple triangles (3-cycles with uniform edge multiplicity $n$) of the factor graph.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proof of a congruence for partitions into two sizes of part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work showed that, for $\nu_2(n)$ the number of partitions of $n$ into exactly two part sizes, one has $\nu_2(16n + 14) \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$. The earlier proof required the technology of modular forms, and a combinatorial proof was desired. This article provides the requested proof, in the process refining divisibility to finer subclasses. Some of these subclasses have counts closely related to the divisor function $d(16n + 14)$, and we offer a conjecture on a potential rank statistic.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Euclidean representations of switching classes of Johnson and Hamming graphs with minimal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers minimum-dimensional representations of graphs in pseudo-Euclidean spaces, where adjacency and non-adjacency relations are reflected in fixed scalar square values. A representation of a simple graph $(V,E)$ is a mapping $\varphi$ from the vertices to the pseudo-Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{p,q}$ such that $||\varphi(u)-\varphi(v)|| = a$ if $(u,v) \in E$, $b$ if $(u,v) \notin E$ and $u \ne v$, and $0$ if $u = v$, for some $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$, where $||\boldsymbol{x}|| = \langle\langle \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x} \rangle\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^p x_i^2 - \sum_{j=1}^q x_{p+j}^2$ is the scalar square of $\boldsymbol{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{p,q}$. For a finite set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^{p,q}$, define $A(X) = \{||\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}|| : \boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y} \in X, \boldsymbol{x} \ne \boldsymbol{y} \}$. We call $X$ an $s$-indefinite-distance set if $|A(X)| = s$. An $s$-indefinite-distance set in $\mathbb{R}^{p,0} = \mathbb{R}^p$ is called an $s$-distance set. Graphs obtained from Seidel switching of a Johnson graph sometimes admit Euclidean or pseudo-Euclidean representations in low dimensions relative to the number of vertices. For example, Lison\v{e}k (1997) obtained a largest 2-distance set in $\mathbb{R}^8$ and spherical 2-indefinite-distance sets in $\mathbb{R}^{p,1}$ for $p \ge 10$ from the switching classes of Johnson graphs. In this paper, we consider graphs in the switching classes of Johnson and Hamming graphs and classify those that admit representations in $\mathbb{R}^{p,q}$ with the smallest possible dimension $p+q$ among all graphs in the same class. This method recovers known results, such as the largest 2-(indefinite)-distance sets constructed by Lison\v{e}k, and also provides a unified framework for determining the minimum dimension of representations for entire switching classes of strongly regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On the number of faces of marked order polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new method for computing the f-vector of a marked order polytope. Namely, given an arbitrary (polyhedral) subdivision of an arbitrary convex polytope, we construct a cochain complex (over the two-element field Z_2) such that the dimensions of its cohomology groups equal the components of the f-vector of the original polytope. In the case of a marked order polytope and its well-known cubosimplicial subdivision, this cochain complex can be described purely combinatorially -- which yields the said computation of the f-vector. Of independent interest may be our combinatorial description of the said cubosimplicial subdivision (which was originally constructed geometrically).</description>

      <title>On the local metric dimension of $K_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( G \) be a graph with order \( n(G) \geq 5 \), local metric dimension \( \dim_l(G) \), and clique number \( \omega(G) \). In this paper, we investigate the local metric dimension of \( K_5 \)-free graphs and prove that \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2}{3}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 4 \). As a consequence of this finding, along with previous publications, we establish that if \( G \) is a \( K_5 \)-free graph, then \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2}{5}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 2 \), \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{1}{2}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 3 \), and \( \dim_l(G) \leq \lfloor\frac{2}{3}n(G)\rfloor \) when \( \omega(G) = 4 \). Notably, these bounds are sharp for planar graphs. These results for graphs with a clique number less than or equal to 4 provide a positive answer to the conjecture stating that if \( n(G) \geq \omega(G) + 1 \geq 4 \), then \( \dim_l(G) \leq \left( \frac{\omega(G) - 2}{\omega(G) - 1} \right)n(G) \).</description>

      <title>Intertwining local (adjacency) metric dimension with the clique number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with order $ n(G)$, local metric dimension $ {\rm dim}_l(G)$, local adjacency metric dimension $ {\rm dim}_{A,l}(G)$, and clique number $ \omega(G)$, where $G\not\cong K_{n(G)}$ and $\omega(G)\geq3$. It is proved that $ {\rm dim}_{A,l}(G) \leq \left\lfloor \left(\frac{\omega(G) - 2}{\omega(G) - 1}\right)n(G)\right\rfloor$. Consequently, the conjecture asserting that the latter expression is an upper bound for ${\rm dim}_l(G)$ is confirmed. It is important to note that there are infinitely many graphs that satisfy the equalities.</description>

      <title>Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of oriented line graphs is introduced by Kotani and Sunada, and they are closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix. It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomial of the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the skew-symmetric adjacency matrix of $\vec{L}(G)$ for $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d\geq 3$. We also exhibit a consequence of this result to star coloring of regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An n-element set contains an unknown number of excellent elements, and our goal is to identify at least one of these elements. The members of a family of subsets can be asked if they contain at least one excellent element or not. At most one of the answers can be wrong. We find the smallest family that finds one excellent element or claims that there is none.</description>

      <title>Continuity of Functions on Bare Representation of Graphs under Star Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel topology, referred to as the star topology, on finite graphs. By treating vertices and edges as points in a unified space, we explore continuous maps between Bare representations of a graph and their properties. The key distinction lies in the fact that while every graph homomorphism induces a continuous map, the converse is not generally true due to potential loss of adjacency information.</description>

      <title>Shape and class of Bruhat Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Bruhat intervals in affine Weyl groups by viewing them as regions of alcoves. In type $\widetilde{A}_2$ we show that each interval coincides with a generalized permutohedron minus a star-shaped polygon, and we prove a subtler version inside the dominant chamber of type $\widetilde{A}_n$. Motivated by this geometry, we conjecture that whenever two Bruhat intervals are isomorphic, there exists an isomorphism realized by a piecewise isometry. We prove this when both endpoints are dominant in $\widetilde{A}_2$ and obtain partial results in $\widetilde{A}_n$. In the course of proving these results, we made the surprising observation that much of the information contained in a Bruhat interval is already encoded in a tiny portion of it.</description>

      <title>Formal Concept Analysis and Homotopical Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal Concept Analysis makes the fundamental observation that any complete lattice $(L, \leq)$ is determined up to isomorphism by the restriction of the relation ${\leq} \subseteq L \times L$ to the set $J(L) \times M(L)$, where $J(L)$ is the set of join-irreducible elements of $L$ and $M(L)$ is the set of meet-irreducible elements of $L$.
  For any finite lattice $L$ equipped with the action of a finite group $G$, we explicitly describe this restricted relation for the lattice of transfer systems $\mathsf{Tr}(L)$ in terms of $L$ only. We apply this to give new computations of the number of transfer systems for certain finite groups, and to produce bounds on the number of transfer systems on certain families of abelian finite groups. We also provide computer code to enable other researchers' use of these techniques.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of Hypergraphs: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs require higher-dimensional representations, which makes it more difficult to compute and interpret their spectral properties. This survey article uses the framework of hypermatrices to give an in-depth overview of the spectral theory of hypergraphs. Our focus in this article relies on the theoretical aspects of hypergraphs that help to ease the computational methods. Spectral theory hypergraphs, one of the most advanced fields of study, are constantly finding novel applications in various domains such as theoretical computer science, quantum physics, and theoretical chemistry, among many others. We start our journey by introducing hypergraphs, hypermatrices (tensors), resultants, and their properties. We outline some of the results used to determine the adjacency spectrum of hypergraphs and go over some of the groundbreaking findings in the development of the theory. On passing through a list of bounds for the spectral radius of uniform hypergraphs, we will have a look into the spectral versions of Tur\'an-type problems in hypergraphs. Finally, in addition to the Estrada index of hypergraphs, some significant results related to the characteristic polynomial and its relationship with the matching polynomial are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a gentle algebra. For every collection of string and band diagrammes, we consider the constructible subset of the variety of representations containing all modules with this underlying diagramme. We study degenerations of such sets. We show that these sets are defined by vectors of integers which we call $h$-vectors and which are related to a restricted version of the hom-order. We provide combinatorial criteria for the existence of a degeneration, involving the removal of an arrow or the resolving of a type of configuration called "reaching".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What might a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients even look like? We introduce a class of combinatorial objects called bitableaux, which we believe are a natural candidate, and we formulate a purely combinatorial problem which if resolved would give a combinatorial interpretation of the Kronecker coefficients. We make some partial progress on this problem -- enough to extract a combinatorial expansion for a Kronecker product of Schur functions in the monomial basis. We also explain how in this framework finding a combinatorial interpretation for Kronecker coefficients can be thought of as looking for a generalization of the RSK and dual RSK insertion algorithms.</description>

We apply this recurrence relation to find explicit formulas for the f-polynomials and h-polynomials of Gelfand-Zetlin polytopes that belong to several simplest one-parameter families.</description>

Abstract: The identity by Chaundy and Bullard expresses $1$ as a sum of two truncated binomial series in one variable where the truncations depend on two different non-negative integers. We present basic and elliptic extensions of the Chaundy--Bullard identity. The most general result, the elliptic extension, involves, in addition to the nome $p$ and the base $q$, four independent complex variables. Our proof uses a suitable weighted lattice path model. We also show how three of the basic extensions can be viewed as B\'ezout identities. Inspired by the lattice path model, we give a new elliptic extension of the binomial theorem, taking the form of an identity for elliptic commuting variables. We further present variants of the homogeneous form of the identity for $q$-commuting and for elliptic commuting variables.</description>

      <title>The generalized Ramsey number $f(n, 5, 8) = \frac 67 n + o(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(p, q)$-coloring of $K_n$ is a coloring of the edges of $K_n$ such that every $p$-clique has at least $q$ distinct colors among its edges. The generalized Ramsey number $f(n, p, q)$ is the minimum number of colors such that $K_n$ has a $(p, q)$-coloring. Gomez-Leos, Heath, Parker, Schweider and Zerbib recently proved $f(n, 5, 8) \ge \frac 67 (n-1)$. Here we prove an asymptotically matching upper bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When $H$ is a forest, the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture implies that every graph $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$ and with bounded clique number has a stable set of linear size. We cannot prove that, but we prove that every such graph $G$ has a stable set of size $|G|^{1-o(1)}$. If $H$ is not a forest, there need not be such a stable set.
  Second, we prove that when $H$ is a ``multibroom'', there {\em is} a stable set of linear size. As a consequence, we deduce that all multibrooms satisfy a ``fractional colouring'' version of the Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture.
  Finally, we discuss extensions of our results to the multicolour setting.</description>

      <title>List strong and list normal edge-coloring of (sub)cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strong edge-coloring of a graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which the edges of every path of length 3 receive distinct colors; in other words, every pair of edges at distance at most 2 must be colored differently. The least number of colors needed for a strong edge-coloring of a graph is the strong chromatic index. We consider the list version of the coloring and prove that the list strong chromatic index of graphs with maximum degree 3 is at most 10. This bound is tight and improves the previous bound of 11 colors.
  We also consider the question whether the strong chromatic index and the list strong chromatic index always coincide. We answer it in negative by presenting an infinite family of graphs for which the two invariants differ. For the special case of the Petersen graph, we show that its list strong chromatic index equals 7, while its strong chromatic index is 5. Up to our best knowledge, this is the first known edge-coloring for which there are graphs with distinct values of the chromatic index and its list version.
  In relation to the above, we also initiate the study of the list version of the normal edge-coloring. A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with 4 colors or to edges colored with 2 colors. It is conjectured that 5 colors suffice for a normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph which is equivalent to the Petersen Coloring Conjecture.
  Similarly to strong edge-coloring, list normal edge-coloring is much more restrictive and consequently for many graphs the list normal chromatic index is greater than the normal chromatic index. We show that there are cubic graphs with list normal chromatic index at least $9$, there are bridgeless cubic graphs with its value at least 8, and there are cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with value at least 7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of maps from $S_n \to S_n$ we call fixed point homing shuffles. These maps generalize a few known problems such as Conway's Topswops, and a card shuffling process studied by Gweneth McKinley. We show that the iterates of these homing shuffles always converge, and characterize the set $U_n$ of permutations that no homing shuffle sorts. We also study a homing shuffle that sorts anything not in $U_n$, and find how many iterations it takes to converge in the worst case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with a thick end whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the full-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of finitely presented groups, and partially solves problems of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and of Georgakopoulos and Hamann.
  Additionally, we show that every (not necessarily quasi-transitive) graph of finite maximum degree which has a thick end and whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor.</description>

      <title>Piecewise-exponential functions and Ehrhart fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies rings of integral piecewise-exponential functions on rational fans. Motivated by lattice-point counting in polytopes, we introduce a special class of unimodular fans called Ehrhart fans, whose rings of integral piecewise-exponential functions admit a canonical linear functional that behaves like a lattice-point count. In particular, we verify that all complete unimodular fans are Ehrhart and that the Ehrhart functional agrees with lattice-point counting in corresponding polytopes, which can otherwise be interpreted as holomorphic Euler characteristics of vector bundles on smooth toric varieties. We also prove that all Bergman fans of matroids are Ehrhart and that the Ehrhart functional in this case agrees with the Euler characteristic of matroids, introduced recently by Larson, Li, Payne, and Proudfoot. A key property that we prove about the Ehrharticity of fans is that it only depends on the support of the fan, not on the fan structure, thus providing a uniform framework for studying K-rings and Euler characteristics of complete fans and Bergman fans simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $t_1,t_2,\dots$ be variables, and let $S$ be the formal power series in the variables $t_1, t_2,\dots$ satisfying $S=1+\sum_{i=1}^\infty t_n S^n.$ Let $S_1 =\sum_{n=1}^\infty t_n$. Wildberger and Rubine recently showed that there is a formal power series $G$ in the $t_i$, which they called the Geode, satisfying $S=1+GS_1$. In this paper we discuss some of the properties of the Geode and of the related series $H=G/S$, which satisfies $S=1/(1-HS_1)$. We show that \begin{equation*} G=\biggl(1-\sum_{n=1}^\infty t_n (1+S+S^2+\cdots+S^{n-1})\biggr)^{-1}, \end{equation*} and \begin{equation*} H=\biggl( 1-\sum_{n=2}^\infty t_n (S+S^2+\cdots+S^{n-1})\biggr)^{-1}, \end{equation*} and we give combinatorial interpretations of $G$ and $H$ in terms of lattice paths.</description>

Abstract: Graph representation matrices are essential tools in graph data analysis. Recently, Hermitian adjacency matrices have been proposed to investigate directed graph structures. Previous studies have demonstrated that these matrices can extract valuable information for clustering. In this paper, we propose the complex non-backtracking matrix that integrates the properties of the Hermitian adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. The proposed matrix has similar properties with the non-backtracking matrix of undirected graphs. We reveal relationships between the complex non-backtracking matrix and the Hermitian adjacency matrix. Also, we provide intriguing insights that this matrix representation holds cluster information, particularly for sparse directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in ultra-small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law distribution. In a non-geometric setting, Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread ultra-fast (SODA 2012), i.e. in doubly logarithmic time. On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly (polynomial time) in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs). Our results are two-fold: first, with Euclidean geometry slow, fast (polylogarithmic) and ultra-fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the strength of the geometry in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries in between. The regimes do not coincide with the graph distance regimes, i.e., polylogarithmic or even polynomial rumour spreading may occur even if graph distances are doubly logarithmic. We expect these results to hold with little effort for related models, e.g. Scale-Free Percolation. Second, we show that rumour spreading is always (at least) fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Euclidean geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. For example, a vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$. Similar but longer chains of vertices, all having non-constant degree, turn out to be useful as well.</description>

      <title>Prime simplicial complexes of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prime simplicial complex $\Pi(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is composed of all sets of primes $S$ where $G$ has an element of order the product of primes in $S$, with the subsets partially ordered by inclusion. This complex was introduced by Peter Cameron as the generalisation of the well-studied prime (or Gruenberg-Kegel) graphs. In this paper, we establish new results concerning two key properties of $\Pi(G)$: recognisability and purity. We demonstrate that recognisability by the prime simplicial complex is strictly stronger than recognisability by the prime graph. Notably, we present the first known example of a group that is recognisable by its prime simplicial complex and spectrum, but not by its prime graph, and is not a direct product of two isomorphic simple groups. Furthermore, we classify groups with pure prime simplicial complexes (i.e., all maximal simplices have the same size) across several infinite families of finite simple groups. We also provide a partial classification for non-abelian finite simple groups whose prime simplicial complex has maximal simplices of size at most 2.</description>

      <title>Comparing the $\mathrm{v}$-number and $h$-polynomials of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the $\mathrm{v}$-numbers and the degree of the $h$-polynomials associated with edge ideals of connected graphs. We prove that the $\mathrm{v}$-number can be arbitrarily larger or smaller than the degree of the $h$-polynomial for the edge ideal of a connected graph. We also establish that for any pair of positive integers $(v,d)$ with $v \leq d$, there exists a connected graph $H(v,d)$ with the $\mathrm{v}$-number equal to $v$ and the degree of $h$-polynomial equal to $d$. Additionally, we show that the sum of the $\mathrm{v}$-number and the degree of the $h$-polynomial is bounded above by $n$, the number of vertices of $G$, and we classify all graphs for which this sum is exactly $n$. Finally, we show that all thirteen possible inequalities among the three invariants, the $\mathrm{v}$-number, the degree of the $h$-polynomial, and the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, can occur in the case of edge ideals of connected graphs. Many of these examples rely on a minimal example of a graph whose $\mathrm{v}$-number is more than the degree of its $h$-polynomial. Using a computer search, we show that there are exactly two such graphs on 11 vertices and 25 edges, and no smaller example on fewer vertices, or 11 vertices and less than 25 edges.</description>
