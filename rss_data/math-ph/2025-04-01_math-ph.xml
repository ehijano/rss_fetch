      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 2: transmission problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second chapter, we analyse transmission problems between a dielectric and a dispersive negative material. In the first part, we consider a transmission problem between two half-spaces, filled respectively by the vacuum and a Drude material, and separated by a planar interface. In this setting, we answer to the following question: does this medium satisfy a limiting amplitude principle? This principle defines the stationary regime as the large time asymptotic behavior of a system subject to a periodic excitation. In the second part, we consider the transmission problem of an infinite strip of Drude material embedded in the vacuum and analyse the existence and dispersive properties of guided waves. In both problems, our spectral analysis enlighten new and unusual physical phenomena for the considered transmission problems due to the presence of the dispersive negative material. In particular, we prove the existence of an interface resonance in the first part and the existence of slow light phenomena for guiding waves in the second part.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the analysis of electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive media. Part 1: general results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in this chapter the mathematical models for electromagnetic wave propagation in dispersive isotropic passive linear media for which the dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon$ and magnetic permeability $\mu$ depend on the frequency. We emphasize the link between physical requirements and mathematical properties of the models. A particular attention is devoted to the notions of causality and passivity and its connection to the existence of Herglotz functions that determine the dispersion of the material. We consider successively the cases of the general passive media and the so-called local media for which $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are rational functions of the frequency. This leads us to analyse the important class of non dissipative and dissipative generalized Lorentz models. In particular, we discuss the connection between mathematical and physical properties of models through the notions of stability, energy conservation, dispersion and modal analyses, group and phase velocities and energy decay in dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Wall-crossing phenomenon for the liquid bin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the liquid bin model as a continuous-time deterministic dynamics, arising as the hydrodynamic limit of a discrete-time stochastic interacting particle system called the infinite bin model. For the liquid bin model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary evolution, to which the dynamics converges exponentially fast. The speed of the front of the system is explicitly computed as a continuous piecewise rational function of the parameters of the model, revealing an underlying wall-crossing phenomenon. We show that the regions on which the speed is rational are of non-empty interior and are naturally indexed by Dyck paths. We provide a complete description of the adjacency structure of these regions, which generalizes the Stanley lattice for Dyck paths. Finally we point out an intriguing connection to the topic of extensions of partial cyclic orders to total cyclic orders.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non -strictly conformal transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher form symmetry, one of the generalized symmetries, considers mainly the action of abelian groups. This is due to the topological nature of symmetry defect operators. In this study, we extend the vector space (or vector bundle) in which the charged operator takes values in order to describe the action of non-abelian groups while preserving this topological property.</description>

      <title>Periodic Motzkin chain: Ground states and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states distinguished by the eigenvalue of the third component of the total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate the Lie algebra of $C$-type of the rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of the total spin operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss nonholonomic contact Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems, that is, systems with a kind of dissipation that are also subject to nonholonomic constraints. We introduce the so-called contact Eden bracket that allows us to obtain the evolution of any observable. Finally, we present a particular vector subspace of observables where the dynamics remain unconstrained.</description>

      <title>A model and characterization of a class of symmetric semibounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G$ be a Hilbert space and $\mathfrak B(\mathcal G)$ the algebra of bounded operators, $\mathcal H=L_2([0,\infty);\mathcal G)$. An operator-valued function $Q\in L_{\infty,\rm loc}\left([0,\infty);\mathfrak B(\mathcal G)\right)$ determines a multiplication operator in $\mathcal H$ by $(Qy)(x)=Q(x)y(x)$, $x\geqslant0$. We say that an operator $L_0$ in a Hilbert space is a Schr\"odinger type operator, if it is unitarily equivalent to $-d^2/dx^2+Q(x)$ on a relevant domain. The paper provides a characterization of a class of such operators. The characterization is given in terms of properties of an evolutionary dynamical system associated with $L_0$. It provides a way to construct a functional Schr\"odinger model of $L_0$.</description>

      <title>On Infinite Tensor Networks, Complementary Recovery and Type II Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of local operator algebras at the boundary of infinite tensor networks, using the mathematical theory of inductive limits. In particular, we consider tensor networks in which each layer acts as a quantum code with complementary recovery, a property that features prominently in the bulk-to-boundary maps intrinsic to holographic quantum error-correcting codes. In this case, we decompose the limiting Hilbert space and the algebras of observables in a way that keeps track of the entanglement in the network. As a specific example, we describe this inductive limit for the holographic HaPPY code model and relate its algebraic and error-correction features. We find that the local algebras in this model are given by the hyperfinite type II$_\infty$ factor. Next, we discuss other networks that build upon this framework and comment on a connection between type II factors and stabilizer circuits. We conclude with a discussion of MERA networks in which complementary recovery is broken. We argue that this breaking possibly permits a limiting type III von Neumann algebra, making them more suitable ans\"atze for approximating subregions of quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Fermions in $(1+2)$-dimensions modified by nonminimal coupling and its applications to condensed matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermions in two-dimensional space, commonly called $(1+2)$-dimensional fermions, exhibit intriguing and distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from their higher-dimensional counterparts. This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical examination of planar fermionic systems, presenting novel findings by incorporating nonminimal coupling. Our analysis includes the computation of the non-relativistic limit up to second-order corrections in the Dirac equation. We also explore the Schr\"odinger equation under the influence of a harmonic potential and an electric field. Furthermore, we investigate how the coupling parameter affects physical properties relevant to condensed matter systems. Our results demonstrate that this parameter significantly impacts electronic properties and Hall conductivity. The interplay between an external electric field and the coupling parameter also influences energy levels and the system's polarizability. These findings underscore the novel effects of including nonminimal coupling in wave equations, offering new insights into the physics of coupled systems.</description>

Abstract: For every family of orthogonal polynomials, we define a new realization of the Yangian of ${\mathfrak{gl}}_n$. Except in the case of Chebyshev polynomials, the new realizations do not satisfy the RTT relation. We obtain an analogue of the Christoffel-Darboux formula. Similar construction can be made for any family of functions satisfying certain recurrence relations, for example, $q$-Pochhhammer symbols and Bessel functions. Furthermore, using an analogue of the Jordan-Schwinger map, we define the ternary Yangian for an arbitrary semisimple Lie algebra as a flat deformation of the current algebra of certain ternary extension of the given Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Universal KPZ Fluctuations for Moderate Deviations of Random Walks in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of diffusion seeks to describe the motion of particles in a chaotic environment. Classical theory models individual particles as independent random walkers, effectively forgetting that particles evolve together in the same environment. Random Walks in a Random Environment (RWRE) models treat the environment as a random space-time field that biases the motion of particles based on where they are in the environment. We provide a universality result for the moderate deviations of the transition probability of this model over a wide class of choices of random environments. In particular, we show the convergence of moments to those of the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (SHE), whose logarithm is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The environment only filters into the scaling limit through one parameter, which depends explicitly on the statistical description of the environment. This forms the basis for our introduction, in arXiv:2406.17733, of the extreme diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by a marginally unstable photon sphere in a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularity spacetime. Using the Picard-Fuchs equation, we derive full-order power series expressions for the deflection angle in various regimes, including the strong deflection limits from both outside and inside the photon sphere. We show that the deflection angle diverges non-logarithmically in both cases, refining existing asymptotic formulae. Comparing truncated approximations with numerical results, we find that higher-order corrections are essential to achieve comparable accuracy to logarithmic divergence cases. Using these improved formulae, we also derive precise approximations for image positions that are not restricted to the almost perfectly aligned cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Galilei group as quantum reference frame transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at the first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Acceleration from a Phase of Entropic Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the notion of generating a cosmic inflation without any big bang singularity. It has been proved recently by Good and Linder (arXiv : 2503.02380v1) that such an expansion of the universe can be driven by quantum fluctuations embedded in vacuum. The rate of expansion is guided by a cosmological sum rule defined through the Schwarzian derivative. We explore the thermodynamic roots of Schwarzian and connect it with the surface gravity associated with an apparent horizon. In General Relativity the cosmological sum rule can be enforced only if the early universe is a Milne vacuum. We show that this restriction can be removed by considering an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Entanglement recycling in probabilistic port-based teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study entangled resource state recycling after one round of probabilistic port-based teleportation. We analytically characterize its degradation and, for the case of the resource state consisting of $N$ EPR pairs, we demonstrate the possibility of reusing it for a subsequent round of teleportation in the $N \to \infty$ limit. For the case of an optimized resource state, we compare the protocol's performance to multi-port-based teleportation, indicating that the resource state reuse is possible.</description>

      <title>The Ising model on cubic maps: arbitrary genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a recursive algorithm to compute the partition function of the Ising model, summed over cubic maps with fixed size and genus. The algorithm runs in polynomial time, which is much faster than methods based on a Tutte-like, or topological, recursion.
  We construct this algorithm out of a partial differential equation that we derive from the first equation of the KP hierarchy satisfied by the generating function of bipartite maps. This series is indeed related to the Ising partition function by a change of variables. We also obtain inequalities on the coefficients of this partition function, which should be useful for a probabilistic study of cubic Ising maps whose genus grows linearly with their size.</description>

      <title>Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Mirror Axion Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an axion soliton, which weakly interacts with background matter and magnetic fields. A mirror-symmetric soliton, for which the magnetic flow is due to secondary magnetic helicity invariant, is described by the Iroshnikov-Kreichnan spectrum. For a large-scale magnetic field dynamo is not observed. In a mirror axionic soliton, a phase transition, which produces a magnetic helical flow, is possible. Using this transition, the soliton becomes mirror-asymmetric. When the mirror symmetry is broken, the axion soliton allows the magnetic energy, which is the result of the transformation of the axionic energy. In the main result, for an initial stage of the process, we calculate a scale for which the generation of large scale magnetic fields is the most intense. By making numerical simulations, we received that lower lateral harmonics of the magnetic field have greater amplitudes compared to higher ones. A simplest statistical ensemble, which is defined by the projection of all harmonics onto principal harmonics is constructed. We put forward an assumption that it was the indication to some instability in axionic MHD. Now, we can provide a possible explanation of this feature. When the mirror symmetry of the axion soliton is broken, the $\gamma$-term in the axionic mean field equation interacts with principal harmonics. As the result, the axion soliton acquires the magnetic energy and becomes helical.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>

      <title>Regular Bohr-Sommerfeld rules for non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators and complex Lagrangian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real-analytic, non-self-adjoint Berezin--Toeplitz operators, up to exponentially small error, on complex one-dimensional compact manifolds, under the hypothesis of regularity of the energy levels. These results form a complex version of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions; they hold under a hypothesis that the skew-adjoint part is small but can be of principal order with respect to the semiclassical parameter.
  To this end, we develop a calculus of Fourier Integral Operators and Lagrangian states associated with complex Lagrangians; these tools can be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the higher Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau-functions, given by the matrix integrals. For these tau-functions we construct the canonical Kac--Schwarz operators, quantum spectral curves, and $W^{(3)}$-constraints. For the simplest representative we construct the cut-and-join operators, which describe the algebraic version of the topological recursion. We also investigate a one-parametric generalization of the higher Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten tau-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we postulate that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi identities, identifying those quantization prescriptions for which this holds true.</description>

      <title>Quantum cellular automata and categorical dualities of spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dualities play a central role in the study of quantum spin chains, providing insight into the structure of quantum phase diagrams and phase transitions. In this work we study categorical dualities, which are defined as bounded-spread isomorphisms between algebras of symmetry-respecting local operators on a spin chain. We consider generalized global symmetries that correspond to unitary fusion categories, which are represented by matrix-product operator algebras. A fundamental question about dualities is whether they can be extended to quantum cellular automata on the larger algebra generated by all local operators that respect the unit matrix-product operator. For conventional global symmetries, which are on-site representations of finite groups, this larger algebra is simply the tensor product of algebras associated to individual spins in the chain. We present a solution to the extension problem using the machinery of Doplicher-Haag-Roberts bimodules. Our solution provides a crisp categorical criterion for when an extension of a duality exists. We show that the set of possible extensions form a torsor over the invertible objects in the relevant symmetry category. As a corollary, we obtain a classification result concerning dualities in the group case.</description>

Abstract: We consider a variational approach to the Bose-Hubbard model based on Bogoliubov theory. We introduce the grand canonical and canonical free energy functionals for which we prove the existence of minimizers. By analyzing their structure we show the existence of a thermally driven phase transition by showing that the system is superfluid at sufficiently low temperatures and insulating at high temperatures. In particular, we show that this model does not exhibit a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the BPHZ renormalisation via multi-indices, a combinatorial structure extremely succesful for describing scalar valued singular SPDEs. We propose the multi-indices counterpart of the Hopf algebraic program initiated by Connes and Kreimer on the renormalisation of Feynman diagrams. The construction relies on a well-chosen extraction-contraction coproduct of multi-indices equipped with a correct symmetry factor. We illustrate our construction on the renormalisation of the $ \Phi^4 $ measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the causal localizations of the massive scalar boson on spacelike hyperplanes extend uniquely to all achronal hyperplanes. The extension occurs by means of the high boost limit in a covariant manner. Towards a localization in maximal achronal surfaces a simple but emblematic case shows that normalization, demanded by causality, is preserved. Moreover the existence of the high boost limit, as a consequence of causality, implies the phenomenon of Lorentz contraction discussed in detail. In conclusion, these considerations constitute a clear plea for the concept of achronal localization.</description>

A physical interpretation of such a model is given and possible methods for its training are discussed. The proposed model can be considered as a simple alternative to possible $p$-adic models based on neural network architecture.</description>

Actually, our theorem does not need any compactness conditions, which leads to wider applications. In particular, our theorem can be applied to semilinear and quasi-linear partial differential equations in unbounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

      <title>Properties and baroclinic instability of stratified thermal upper-ocean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of, and investigate the stability of a baroclinic zonal current in, a thermal rotating shallow-water model, sometimes called \emph{Ripa's model}, featuring stratification for quasigeostrophic upper-ocean dynamics. The model has Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure. In addition to Casimirs, the model supports weak Casimirs forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket for the potential vorticity evolution independent of the details of the buoyancy as this is advected under the flow. The model sustains Rossby waves and a neutral model, whose spurious growth is prevented by a positive-definite integral, quadratic on the deviation from the motionless state. A baroclinic zonal jet with vertical curvature is found to be spectrally stable for specific configurations of the gradients of layer thickness, vertically averaged buoyancy, and buoyancy frequency. Only a subset of such states was found Lyapunov stable using the available integrals, except the weak Casimirs, whose role in constraining stratified thermal flow remains to be understood. The existence of Lyapunov-stable states enabled us to \emph{a priori} bound the nonlinear growth of perturbations to spectrally unstable states. Our results do not support the generality of earlier numerical evidence on the suppression of submesoscale wave activity as a result of the inclusion of stratification in thermal shallow-water theory, which we supported with direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of Open Quantum Systems via Hypocoercivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mixing of open quantum systems is a fundamental problem in physics and quantum information science. Existing approaches for estimating the mixing time often rely on the spectral gap estimation of the Lindbladian generator, which can be challenging to obtain in practice. We propose a novel theoretical framework to estimate the mixing time of open quantum systems that treats the Hamiltonian and dissipative part separately, thus circumventing the need for a priori estimation of the spectral gap of the full Lindbladian generator. This framework yields mixing time estimates for a class of quantum systems that are otherwise hard to analyze, even though it does not apply to arbitrary Lindbladians. The technique is based on the construction of an energy functional inspired by the hypocoercivity of (classical) kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Time Quantum Gibbs Sampling for Fermi-Hubbard Model at any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there have been several advancements in quantum algorithms for Gibbs sampling. These algorithms simulate the dynamics generated by an artificial Lindbladian, which is meticulously constructed to obey a detailed-balance condition with the Gibbs state of interest, ensuring it is a stationary point of the evolution, while simultaneously having efficiently implementable time steps. The overall complexity then depends primarily on the mixing time of the Lindbladian, which can vary drastically, but which has been previously bounded in the regime of high enough temperatures [Rouz\'e et al. arXiv:2403.12691 and arXiv:2411.04885]. In this work, we calculate the spectral gap of the Lindbladian for free fermions using third quantisation, and also prove a logarithmic bound on its mixing time by analysing corresponding covariance matrices. Then we prove a constant gap of the perturbed Lindbladian corresponding to interacting fermions up to some maximal coupling strength. This is achieved by using theorems about stability of the gap for lattice fermions. Our methods apply at any constant temperature and independently of the system size. The gap then provides an upper bound on the mixing time, and hence on the overall complexity of the quantum algorithm, proving that the purified Gibbs state of weakly interacting (quasi-)local fermionic systems of any dimension can be prepared in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (n^3 \operatorname{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ time on $\mathcal{O}(n)$ qubits, where $n$ denotes the size of the system and $\epsilon$ the desired accuracy. As an application, we explain how to calculate partition functions for the considered systems. We provide exact numerical simulations for small system sizes supporting the theory and also identify different suitable jump operators and filter functions for the sought-after regime of intermediate coupling in the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention.
  We study the dynamics of non-autonomous, time-periodically forced, Dirac Hamiltonians: $i\partial_t\alpha =D(t)\alpha$, where $D(t)=i\sigma_3\partial_x+ \nu(t)$ is time-periodic but not spatially localized. For the special case $\nu(t)=m\sigma_1$, which models a relativistic particle of constant mass $m$, one has a dispersive decay bound: $\|\alpha(t,x)\|_{L^\infty_x}\lesssim t^{-\frac12}$. Previous analyses of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians suggest that this decay bound persists for small, spatially-localized and time-periodic $\nu(t)$. However, we show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. Specifically, we study two non-autonomous Dirac models whose time-evolution (and monodromy operator) is constructed via Fourier analysis. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. However, in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different. By stationary-phase analysis of the associated Fourier representation, we display initial data for which the $L^\infty_x$ time-decay rate are considerably slower: $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ or even $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/5})$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Contextuality of Quantum Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation, with deep connections to entanglement, magic, and uncertainty relations. Entanglement, for instance, has driven key advances like surface codes and has deepened our understanding of quantum gravity through holographic quantum codes. While these connections are well-explored, the role of contextuality, a fundamental nonclassical feature of quantum theory, remains unexplored. Notably, Bell nonlocality is a special case of contextuality, and prior works have established contextuality as a key resource for quantum computational advantage.
  In this work, we establish the first direct link between contextuality and quantum error-correcting codes. Using a sheaf-theoretic framework, we define contextuality for such codes and prove key results on its manifestation. Specifically, we prove the equivalence of definitions of contextuality from Abramsky--Brandenburger's sheaf-theoretic framework and Kirby--Love's tree-based approach for the partial closure of Pauli measurement sets. We present several findings, including the proof of a recent conjecture posed by Kim and Abramsky. Working within the partial closure, we further show that subsystem stabilizer codes with two or more gauge qubits are strongly contextual, while others are noncontextual. As a consequence, we highlight that several protocols for code-switching between stabilizer codes, which admit a universal transversal gate set, are strongly contextual. Our findings reveal a direct connection between contextuality and quantum error correction, offering new insights into the nonclassical resources enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>CLT for LES of correlated Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices such that the $ij$th entry of one matrix is correlated with the $ij$th entry of the other matrix. However, the entries of any particular matrix are i.i.d. random variables. We study the asymptotic behavior of the combined spectrum, and the limit of the linear eigenvalue statistic defined on the combined spectrum. We show that if the random variables are centered with variance $1/n$ and having finite moments, then the centered \textit{Linear Eigenvalue Statistics} (LESs) converge jointly to a bivariate Gaussian distribution. We assumed that the test function used in the LES belongs to Sobolev $H^{2+\delta}$ space. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution depends on correlation structure of the matrix entries and the fourth order mixed cumulants of the matrix entries. This generalizes the previous results by Rider, Silverstein (2006), Cipolloni, Erd\H{o}s, Schr\"oder (2023). In particular, we obtain the limiting LES of random centrosymmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the symmetric subspace of qubit chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetric subspace of multi-qubit systems, that is, the space of states invariant under permutations, is commonly encountered in applications in the context of quantum information and communication theory. It is known that the symmetric subspace can be described in terms of irreducible representations of the group $SU(2)$, whose representation spaces form a basis of symmetric states, the so-called Dicke states. In this work, we present deformations of the symmetric subspace as deformations of this group structure, which are promoted to a quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$. We see that deformations of the symmetric subspace obtained in this manner correspond to local deformations of the inner product of each spin, in such a way that departure from symmetry can be encoded in a position-dependent inner product. The consequences and possible extensions of these results are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Energy Inequality for a Non-commutative QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum energy inequality (QEI) for quantum field theories formulated in non-commutative spacetimes, extending fundamental energy constraints to this generalized geometric framework. By leveraging operator-theoretic methods inspired by the positivity map of Waldmann et al. \cite{waldmannpos}, we construct linear combinations of deformed operators that generalize the commutative spacetime techniques of Fewster et al., \cite{Few98}. These non-commutative analogs enable us the derivation of a lower bound on the deformed averaged energy density, ensuring the stability of the underlying quantum field theory. Our result establishes rigorous constraints on the expectation values of the deformed (non-commutative) energy density, reinforcing the physical consistency of non-commutative models while preserving core principles of quantum field theory.</description>
