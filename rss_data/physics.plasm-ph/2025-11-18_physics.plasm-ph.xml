      <title>Parallelized Real-time Physics Codes for Plasma Control on DIII-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real-time safe multi-threading library was developed on the DIII-D plasma control system to optimize the realtime TORBEAM and real-time STRIDE physics codes. These physics codes are crucial for future fusion power plant operation as they provide information about electron cyclotron wave propagation and heating as well as inform about ideal plasma stability limits. The real-time TORBEAM code executed consistently in under 20 ms while the real-time STRIDE code computes in 100 ms. The multi-threading library developed in this work can be applied to other real-time physics-based codes that will be crucial for the next generation of fusion devices.</description>

      <title>An Adjoint Formulation of Energetic Particle Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adjoint formulation of energetic particle confinement in axisymmetric geometry is derived and evaluated using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The PINN estimates the escape time of energetic ions by solving an inhomogeneous adjoint of the drift kinetic equation with a Lorentz collision operator, yielding predictions of the escape time of fast ions in tokamak geometry due to direct ion orbit loss and collisional transport. This is the first time a PINN has been used to solve the drift kinetic equation in tokamak geometry, a challenging problem due to the large time scale separation present between the rapid transit time of energetic ions, and their slow collision time scale. It is shown that a careful and intentional design of a PINN is able to learn the escape time for the majority of the geometry considered, suggesting a path toward constructing a rapid surrogate for use in a broader optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Impacts of Three Types of Plasma-Activated Water on the Seed Germination and Plant Growth of Lettuce (Lactuca sativa)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold air plasma typically generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), which are transported into water to produce plasma-activated water (PAW). This study examines the effect of PAW produced by three different plasma systems on lettuce: transient spark, fountain dielectric barrier discharge, and microwave plasma. Physiochemical PAW properties and concentrations of RONS (ozone, hydrogen peroxide, nitrite, and nitrate) were measured. Seed germination parameters were recorded in 8-day paper tests. The effect of PAW irrigation was investigated after 6 weeks of plant growth in the soil by measuring the germination rate, plant and root length, dry and fresh plant weight, number of leaves, and photosynthetic pigments. PAW, dependent upon its RONS contents, enhances plant development and affects its physiological parameters.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative 2D spatial measurements of electric fields within a plasma sheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>A robust method for calculating plasma waves absorption in magnetized plasmas and its implementation in the BORAY ray-tracing code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust numerical method for calculating the total absorption rate of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas, capable of determining the absorption ratio among different plasma components. The method adopts Ronnmark's expressions for the plasma dispersion function, $Z({\zeta})$, and the dielectric tensor, K, to overcome the convergence issues and computational inefficiency of the traditional Bessel function summation approach for evaluating the hot plasma dispersion relation, D, particularly at large $k_\perp$. It has been implemented and validated across multiple frequency regimes, including ion cyclotron (ICRF), lower hybrid (LHRF), and electron cyclotron (ECRF) ranges of frequencies, with results benchmarked against conventional $Z({\zeta})$ and Bessel function expansions. Integrated into the BORAY ray-tracing code, the method uses expressions derived from the anti-Hermitian part of the dielectric tensor to compute absorption ratios. This work extends the ray-tracing framework, providing a more reliable tool for wave heating simulations.</description>

      <title>Case study of a differentiable heterogeneous multiphysics solver for a nuclear fusion application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.</description>

      <title>Formation of HNC and HCN isomers in molecular plasmas revealed by frequency comb and quantum cascade laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a well-known product in combustion, astrophysical, and plasma environments, but its isomer, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), remains unexplored in molecular plasmas. Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Gyrating Ions in Reformation of a Quasi-parallel Supercritical Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks in space and astrophysical plasmas mediate energy exchange between charged particles and fields in two or more plasma flows. In this study we analyze the evolution of ion distributions around a reformation cycle of a quasi-parallel shock. We use multi-point in-situ observations in the foreshock region of the Earths bow shock of a transient foreshock structure as it generates a shock. We find that backstreaming ions in the foreshock create a density and magnetic field depletion known as caviton which locally changes the shock geometry. Gyrating suprathermal ions that emerge within the caviton and reach the upstream edge of the core create a cross-field current imbalance that results in the nonlinear growth of a new shock layer. The new shock forms from the background foreshock fields over a distance of ~6 ion inertial lengths ($l_i$) and within 4.5 to 11.2 $l_i$ from the main bow shock. We find that plasma compression at the new thin shock layer is due to compactification of the cold upstream ion beam by high amplitude magnetic field-aligned electrostatic fields. At later stages, the plasma compression expands to form a new sheath.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analytical Model of the Dynamic Z-Pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical 1D axisymmetric model describing the evolution of the dynamic z-pinch. This model is capable of predicting the trajectories of the imploding sheath's magnetic piston and preceding shock front, along with the velocity, pressure, density, and magnetic field profiles, for any time-dependent current, spatially-varying initial density profile, and weak initial axial field. The implosion is divided into stages, with each stage described by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations derived from the ideal MHD equations. Comparison with experimental data from the COBRA pulsed-power facility is quite promising and implies this model could prove useful in designing and analyzing future pulsed-power experiments.</description>
