      <title>Interacting electrons in silicon quantum interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Learning microstructure in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding microstructure in terms of closed-form expressions is an open challenge in nonequilibrium statistical physics. We propose a simple and generic method that combines particle-resolved simulations, deep neural networks and symbolic regression to predict the pair-correlation function of passive and active particles. Our analytical closed-form results closely agree with Brownian dynamics simulations, even at relatively large packing fractions and for strong activity. The proposed method is broadly applicable, computationally efficient, and can be used to enhance the predictive power of nonequilibrium continuum theories and for designing pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical entanglement percolation with spatially correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The distribution of entanglement between the nodes of a quantum network plays a fundamental role in quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Many Body Localization Crossover as a Metal-Insulator Transition: Localization length from Polarization and Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many body localization (MBL) represents a unique physical phenomenon, providing a testing ground for exploring thermalization, or more precisely its failure. Here we characterize the MBL regime geometrically by the many-body quantum metric (MBQM), defined in the parameter space of twist boundary, and the localization parameter as defined in the modern theory of polarization and insulators. First, we demonstrate that the quantum metric can be used to characterize disordered insulating states by applying this theoretical framework to excited states of the 1D Anderson insulator. There we observe that the MBQM and localization parameter are related in finite realizations despite the states being gapless in the thermodynamic limit. Then, we consider a disordered 1D Bose-Hubbard model and find that we can characterize the ergodic-MBL crossover by comparing the MBQM and localization parameter. We find that we can extract a natural localization length in the MBL regime that characterizes the real space spread of the wave function and can be measured by extracting the quantum metric. Our analysis provides complementary insight into the MBL regime focusing on its insulating properties and providing a localization length whose definition is consistent across a range of insulating phases.</description>

      <title>Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organizing Systems through Invariant Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organization central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modeling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modeling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on three self-organizing systems: a physical, a biological, and a social one; namely, a reaction-diffusion system, a model of embryonic development, and an agent-based model of social segregation. We show that the method reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the pattern outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.</description>
