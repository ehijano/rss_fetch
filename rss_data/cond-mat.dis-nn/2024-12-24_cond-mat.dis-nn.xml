      <title>Variational Evolutionary Network for Statistical Physics Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used importance sampling techniques for studying complex physical systems. Integrating these methods with deep learning has significantly improved efficiency and accuracy in high-dimensional problems and complex system simulations. However, these neural network-enhanced Monte Carlo methods still face challenges such as slow sampling speeds, statistical bias, and inaccuracies in the ground state. To address these issues, we propose a variational evolutionary network, which utilizes neural networks for variational free energy and combines evolutionary algorithms for sampling. During the sampling process, we construct generation and selection operators to filter samples based on importance, thereby achieving efficient importance sampling. We demonstrate that this sampling method provides an upper bound on the ground-state energy, enhancing both sampling efficiency and ground-state accuracy. Moreover, we numerically examine our method in two-dimensional Ising model and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model for spin glass. Thus, our algorithm could offer improved accuracy in handling complex energy landscapes and significantly enhance computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Density Function of Weighted Sum of Chi-Square Variables with Trigonometric Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated a weighted chi-square distribution of the variable $\xi$ which is a weighted sum of squared normally distributed independent variables whose weights are cosines of angles $\phi_k=2\pi k/N$, where $k \in \{0,1,...,N-1\}$ and $N$ is the number of the freedom degrees. We have found the exact expression for the density function of this distribution and its approximation for large $N$. The distribution is compared with the Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>The quantum $p$-spin renormalization group in the large $N$ limit as a benchmark for functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain a deeper understanding of the glassy phase in $p$-spin quantum models, this paper examines the dynamics of the $N$-vector $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the framework of renormalization group theory. First, we focus on perturbation theory, which is more suitable than nonperturbative techniques due to the specific temporal non-locality of the model after disorder integration. We compute the one-loop $\beta$-function and explore the structure of its fixed points. Next, we develop the nonperturbative renormalization group approach based on the standard Wetterich-Morris formalism, using two approximation schemes to address the model's non-locality. We investigate the vertex expansion in the symmetric phase and assess the reliability of the approximations for the fixed-point solutions. Finally, we extend our analysis beyond the symmetric phase by using an expansion around the vacuum of the local potential. Our numerical investigations particularly focus on the cases $p = 2$ and $p=3$.</description>

      <title>Decoding fairness: a reinforcement learning perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavioral experiments on the ultimatum game (UG) reveal that we humans prefer fair acts, which contradicts the prediction made in orthodox Economics. Existing explanations, however, are mostly attributed to exogenous factors within the imitation learning framework. Here, we adopt the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their moves aiming to maximize their accumulated rewards. Specifically, we apply Q-learning to UG, where each player is assigned two Q-tables to guide decisions for the roles of proposer and responder. In a two-player scenario, fairness emerges prominently when both experiences and future rewards are appreciated. In particular, the probability of successful deals increases with higher offers, which aligns with observations in behavioral experiments. Our mechanism analysis reveals that the system undergoes two phases, eventually stabilizing into fair or rational strategies. These results are robust when the rotating role assignment is replaced by a random or fixed manner, or the scenario is extended to a latticed population. Our findings thus conclude that the endogenous factor is sufficient to explain the emergence of fairness, exogenous factors are not needed.</description>

      <title>Knowledge as a Breaking of Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a thermodynamic potential that can guide training of a generative model defined on a set of binary degrees of freedom. We argue that upon reduction in description, so as to make the generative model computationally-manageable, the potential develops multiple minima. This is mirrored by the emergence of multiple minima in the free energy proper of the generative model itself. The variety of training samples that employ N binary degrees of freedom is ordinarily much lower than the size 2^N of the full phase space. The non-represented configurations, we argue, should be thought of as comprising a high-temperature phase separated by an extensive energy gap from the configurations composing the training set. Thus, training amounts to sampling a free energy surface in the form of a library of distinct bound states, each of which breaks ergodicity. The ergodicity breaking prevents escape into the near continuum of states comprising the high-temperature phase; thus it is necessary for proper functionality. It may however have the side effect of limiting access to patterns that were underrepresented in the training set. At the same time, the ergodicity breaking within the library complicates both learning and retrieval. As a remedy, one may concurrently employ multiple generative models -- up to one model per free energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between coherence and dissipation for excitable phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bounds coherence in stochastic oscillatory systems. In this paper, we show that both dynamical and thermodynamic bounds play important roles for the excitable oscillators, e.g. neurons. Firstly, we investigate the trade-off between coherence and dissipation both in the sub and super-threshold regions for a single excitable unit, where both the TUR and the SNIC bounds constrain the fluctuation of inter-spike intervals. Secondly, we show that the widely studied phenomenon called coherence resonance, where there exists a noise strength to make the oscillatory responses of the system most coherent, is also bounded by the TUR in the one-dimensional excitable phase model. Finally, we study the coherence-dissipation relation in ensembles of strongly coupled excitable oscillators.</description>

      <title>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. We observe that the erasure errors enter as a classical average over fully depolarizing channels. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a $50\%$ threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds under realistic noise and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Development of a Neuromorphic Network Using BioSFQ Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor electronics (SCE) appear promising for low energy applications. However, the achieved and projected circuit densities are insufficient for direct competition with CMOS technology. Original algorithms and nontraditional architectures are required for realizing SCE energy advantages for computing. Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is a commonly discussed deviation from conventional CMOS digital solutions. Instead of mimicking a conventional network of artificial neurons, we compose a network from the previously demonstrated single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics components which we termed bioSFQ. We present a design and operation of a new neuromorphic circuit containing a 3x3 array of bioSFQ cells - superconductor artificial neurons - capable of performing various analog functions and based on Josephson junction comparators with complementary outputs. The resultant asynchronous network closely resembles a three-layer perceptron. We also present superconductor analog memory and the memory Read/Write interface implemented with the neural network. The circuits were fabricated in the SFQ5ee process at MIT Lincoln Laboratory.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Shape of the Structural Relaxation in Deeply Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural relaxation in deeply supercooled liquids is non-exponential. In susceptibility representation, $\chi^{\prime\prime}(\nu)$, the spectral shape of the structural relaxation is observed as an asymmetrically broadened peak with a $\nu^{1}$ low- and $\nu^{-\beta}$ high-frequency behavior. In this perspective article we discuss common notions, recent results and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of $\nu^{-1/2}$ appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of different deeply supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. Additionally, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic $\nu^{-1/2}$ behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape towards higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Scaling Description of the Relaxation Dynamics and Dynamical Heterogeneity of an Active Glass-forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active glasses refer to a class of driven non-equilibrium systems that share remarkably similar dynamical behavior as conventional glass-formers in equilibrium. Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various biological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces additional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density fluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular dynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more strongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit results in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We also propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation spectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective temperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the dynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing activity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system size dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not been found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small activities.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</description>

      <title>Spatial localization and diffusion of Dirac particles and waves induced by random temporal medium variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation in time-varying media has attracted significant attention for its innovative potential to control wave-matter interactions and to develop versatile active materials. While most research has focused on electromagnetic waves, studies on Dirac-type waves remain limited. In this work, we investigate temporal scattering in pseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems with random temporal mass variations. Using the invariant imbedding method, we derive exact expressions for temporal reflectance in both short- and long-time regimes. In the long-time limit, reflectance probabilities become uniformly distributed, and wave group velocities decay to zero, indicating spatial localization. Numerical simulations reveal that narrow wave pulses evolve into Gaussian shapes, with their centers localizing and their widths growing indefinitely due to diffusive behavior. This universal phenomenon is independent of the initial pulse profile and the statistical properties of the random mass. Our findings demonstrate that random temporal variations can induce insulating behavior in Dirac materials, offering potential applications in solid-state physics and optics.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to study the functional renormalization group for quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$. By fixing the gauge symmetry in the construction of the FRG, that breaks the $O(N)$-symmetry and deriving the corresponding non-trivial Ward identity we can: In the first time coarse grain and focus on this study using a more attractive method such as the effective vertex expansion, and in the second time explore this model beyond the symmetry phase. We show finite scale singularities due to the disorder, interpreted as the signal in the perturbation theory. The unconventional renormalization group approach is based on coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic term, with an eigenvalue distribution following a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. As an illustration, the case where $p=3$ is scrutinized.</description>

Abstract: Statistical physics provides tools for analyzing high-dimensional problems in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. These calculations, particularly those using the replica method, often involve lengthy derivations that can obscure physical interpretation. We give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology protected by latent crystalline symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02704</link>

Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Bias in Motion: Theoretical Insights into the Dynamics of Bias in SGD Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18296</link>

Abstract: Machine learning systems often acquire biases by leveraging undesired features in the data, impacting accuracy variably across different sub-populations. Current understanding of bias formation mostly focuses on the initial and final stages of learning, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the transient dynamics. To address this gap, this paper explores the evolution of bias in a teacher-student setup modeling different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model. We provide an analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in this setting, which we prove to be exact in high dimension. Notably, our analysis reveals how different properties of sub-populations influence bias at different timescales, showing a shifting preference of the classifier during training. Applying our findings to fairness and robustness, we delineate how and when heterogeneous data and spurious features can generate and amplify bias. We empirically validate our results in more complex scenarios by training deeper networks on synthetic and real datasets, including CIFAR10, MNIST, and CelebA.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($&gt; \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$, which not only depends on the pinning method but is different from $\phi_d$ of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Impurity effects in twisted carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topology and Spectrum in Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions</title>

Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Does the brain behave like a (complex) network? I. Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph theory is now becoming a standard tool in system-level neuroscience. However, endowing observed brain anatomy and dynamics with a complex network structure does not entail that the brain actually works as a network. Asking whether the brain behaves as a network means asking whether network properties count. From the viewpoint of neurophysiology and, possibly, of brain physics, the most substantial issues a network structure may be instrumental in addressing relate to the influence of network properties on brain dynamics and to whether these properties ultimately explain some aspects of brain function. Here, we address the dynamical implications of complex network, examining which aspects and scales of brain activity may be understood to genuinely behave as a network. To do so, we first define the meaning of networkness, and analyse some of its implications. We then examine ways in which brain anatomy and dynamics can be endowed with a network structure and discuss possible ways in which network structure may be shown to represent a genuine organisational principle of brain activity, rather than just a convenient description of its anatomy and dynamics.</description>
