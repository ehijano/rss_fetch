      <title>Adaptive Semantic Communication for UAV/UGV Cooperative Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective path planning is fundamental to the coordination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) systems, particularly in applications such as surveillance, navigation, and emergency response. Combining UAVs' broad field of view with UGVs' ground-level operational capability greatly improve the likelihood of successfully achieving task objectives such as locating victims, monitoring target areas, or navigating hazardous terrain. In complex environments, UAVs need to provide precise environmental perception information for UGVs to optimize their routing policy. However, due to severe interference and non-line-of-sight conditions, wireless communication is often unstable in such complex environments, making it difficult to support timely and accurate path planning for UAV-UGV coordination. To this end, this paper proposes a semantic communication (SemCom) framework to enhance UAV/UGV cooperative path planning under unreliable wireless conditions. Unlike traditional methods that transmit raw data, SemCom transmits only the key information for path planning, reducing transmission volume without sacrificing accuracy. The proposed framework is developed by defining key semantics for path planning and designing a transceiver for meeting the requirements of UAV-UGV cooperative path planning. Simulation results show that, compared to conventional SemCom transceivers, the proposed transceiver significantly reduces data transmission volume while maintaining path planning accuracy, thereby enhancing system collaboration efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control Aware Semantic Communication Enabled Image Transmission for Lunar Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary challenge in autonomous lunar landing missions lies in the unreliable local control system, which has limited capacity to handle high-dynamic conditions, severely affecting landing precision and safety. Recent advancements in lunar satellite communication make it possible to establish a wireless link between lunar orbit satellites and the lunar lander. This enables satellites to run high-performance autonomous landing algorithms, improving landing accuracy while reducing the lander's computational and storage load. Nevertheless, traditional communication paradigms are not directly applicable due to significant temperature fluctuations on the lunar surface, intense solar radiation, and severe interference caused by lunar dust on hardware. The emerging technique of semantic communication (SemCom) offers significant advantages in robustness and resource efficiency, particularly under harsh channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel SemCom framework for transmitting images from the lander to satellites operating the remote landing control system. The proposed encoder-decoder dynamically adjusts the transmission strategy based on real-time feedback from the lander's control algorithm, ensuring the accurate delivery of critical image features and enhancing control reliability. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the conditions that improve the accuracy of the control algorithm and reduce end-to-end transmission time under the proposed framework. Simulation results demonstrate that our SemCom method significantly enhances autonomous landing performance compared to traditional communication methods.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Anti-Jamming UAV Swarm Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue.
  This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further research.</description>

      <title>From Description to Detection: LLM based Extendable O-RAN Compliant Blind DoS Detection in 5G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.</description>

      <title>Advantages of Global Entanglement-Distillation Policies in Quantum Repeater Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are essential for achieving long-distance quantum communication due to photon loss, which grows exponentially with the channel distance. Current quantum repeater generations use entanglement distillation protocols, where the decision of when to perform distillation depends on either local or global knowledge. Recent approaches for quantum repeaters, such as Mantri et al. (arXiv:2409.06152), consider using deterministic local decision policies for entanglement distillation. We ask whether global deterministic policies outperform local ones in terms of communication rate. We simulate equidistant repeater chains, assisted by two-way classical communication, and compare local and global policies for distillation decisions, spanning large distances and varying network and hardware parameters. Our findings show that global deterministic policies consistently outperform these local ones, and in some cases, determine whether secret communication is possible. For large repeater chains ($N&gt;512$), global policies improve SKR by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that local distillation decisions in quantum repeater chains may not be optimal, and may inform future protocol design.</description>

      <title>Memory-Augmented Generative AI for Real-time Wireless Prediction in Dynamic Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</description>

      <title>GNN-enhanced Traffic Anomaly Detection for Next-Generation SDN-Enabled Consumer Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consumer electronics (CE) connected to the Internet of Things are susceptible to various attacks, including DDoS and web-based threats, which can compromise their functionality and facilitate remote hijacking. These vulnerabilities allow attackers to exploit CE for broader system attacks while enabling the propagation of malicious code across the CE network, resulting in device failures. Existing deep learning-based traffic anomaly detection systems exhibit high accuracy in traditional network environments but are often overly complex and reliant on static infrastructure, necessitating manual configuration and management. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable network model that integrates Software-defined Networking (SDN) and Compute First Networking (CFN) for next-generation CE networks. In this network model, we propose a Graph Neural Networks-based Network Anomaly Detection framework (GNN-NAD) that integrates SDN-based CE networks and enables the CFN architecture. GNN-NAD uniquely fuses a static, vulnerability-aware attack graph with dynamic traffic features, providing a holistic view of network security. The core of the framework is a GNN model (GSAGE) for graph representation learning, followed by a Random Forest (RF) classifier. This design (GSAGE+RF) demonstrates superior performance compared to existing feature selection methods. Experimental evaluations on CE environment reveal that GNN-NAD achieves superior metrics in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, even with small sample sizes, exceeding the performance of current network anomaly detection methods. This work advances the security and efficiency of next-generation intelligent CE networks.</description>

      <title>RevealNet: Distributed Traffic Correlation for Attack Attribution on Programmable Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network attackers have increasingly resorted to proxy chains, VPNs, and anonymity networks to conceal their activities. To tackle this issue, past research has explored the applicability of traffic correlation techniques to perform attack attribution, i.e., to identify an attacker's true network location. However, current traffic correlation approaches rely on well-provisioned and centralized systems that ingest flows from multiple network probes to compute correlation scores. Unfortunately, this makes correlation efforts scale poorly for large high-speed networks.
  In this paper, we propose RevealNet, a decentralized framework for attack attribution that orchestrates a fleet of P4-programmable switches to perform traffic correlation. RevealNet builds on a set of correlation primitives inspired by prior work on computing and comparing flow sketches -- compact summaries of flows' key characteristics -- to enable efficient, distributed, in-network traffic correlation. Our evaluation suggests that RevealNet achieves comparable accuracy to centralized attack attribution systems while significantly reducing both the computational complexity and bandwidth overheads imposed by correlation tasks.</description>

      <title>Sustainable LSTM-Based Precoding for RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems with Implicit CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a sustainable long short-term memory (LSTM)-based precoding framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. Instead of explicit channel state information (CSI) estimation, the framework exploits uplink pilot sequences to implicitly learn channel characteristics, reducing both pilot overhead and inference complexity. Practical hardware constraints are addressed by incorporating the phase-dependent amplitude model of RIS elements, while a multi-label training strategy improves robustness when multiple near-optimal codewords yield comparable performance. Simulations show that the proposed design achieves over 90% of the spectral efficiency of exhaustive search (ES) with only 2.2% of its computation time, cutting energy consumption by nearly two orders of magnitude. The method also demonstrates resilience under distribution mismatch and scalability to larger RIS arrays, making it a practical and energy-efficient solution for sustainable 6G wireless networks.</description>
