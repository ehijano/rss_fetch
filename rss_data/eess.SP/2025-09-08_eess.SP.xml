      <title>Communication-Efficient Collaborative LLM Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is an emerging technique that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens in advance, which are then verified or corrected by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this paradigm is well-suited for collaborative inference between resource-constrained end devices and more capable edge servers or base stations (BSs). However, existing distributed speculative decoding requires transmitting the full vocabulary probability distribution from the draft model on the device to the target model at the BS, which leads to prohibitive uplink communication overhead. To address this issue, we propose a ``Top-K Sparse Logits Transmission (TK-SLT)`` scheme, where the draft model transmits only the top-K token raw probabilities and the corresponding token indices instead of the entire distribution. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth consumption while maintaining inference performance. We further derive an analytical expression for the optimal draft length that maximizes inference throughput, and provide a theoretical analysis of the achievable speedup ratio under TK-SLT. Experimental results validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Tangential Velocity Estimation Using Near-Field Automotive Radar Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of tangential velocity estimation in automotive radar systems, addressing the limitations of conventionally considered models. Conventional automotive radars are usually based on far-field models and estimate the target's range, radial velocity, and direction-of-arrival (DOA) but are not able to estimate the tangential component of the target 2-D velocity, which is a critical parameter for reliable perception of dynamic environments. To address this challenge, we introduce the near-field radar model, which considers various migration elements in range, radial velocity, and Doppler along time and space. Conventionally, these migration effects result in smearing of the likelihood function for estimating the target parameters. However, if the model is correctly specified, these migration effects are informative for tangential velocity estimation. We conduct an identifiability analysis for tangential velocity estimation using the Cram\'er-Rao bound and ambiguity function. The insights from this study motivate the use of a separated array configuration and the development of a computationally efficient maximum likelihood based algorithm designed to utilize target migrations for tangential velocity estimation, while maintaining practical computational complexity. In addition to tangential velocity estimation, the proposed algorithm mitigates likelihood smearing in range, radial velocity, and Doppler. Simulations validate the theoretical feasibility study, and evaluate the algorithms' performance in both single- and multi-target scenarios. The proposed approach improves the accuracy and reliability of automotive radars, enhancing situational awareness for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware IRS Deployment via Channel Knowledge Map: Joint Sensing-Communications Coverage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) deployment optimization problem for IRS-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, in which multiple IRSs are strategically deployed at candidate locations to assist a base station (BS) to enhance the coverage of both sensing and communications. We present an environment-aware IRS deployment design via exploiting the channel knowledge map (CKM), which provides the channel state information (CSI) between each candidate IRS location and BS or targeted sensing/communication points. Based on the obtained CSI from CKM, we optimize the deployment of IRSs, jointly with the BS's transmit beamforming and IRSs' reflective beamforming during operation, with the objective of minimizing the system cost, while guaranteeing the minimum illumination power requirements at sensing areas and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements at communication areas. In particular, we consider two cases when the IRSs' reflective beamforming optimization can be implemented dynamically in real time and quasi-stationarily over the whole operation period, respectively. For both cases, the joint IRS deployment and transmit/reflective beamforming designs are formulated as mixed-integer non-convex optimization problems, which are solved via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based relax-and-bound method. Specifically, we first relax the binary IRS deployment indicators into continuous variables, then find converged solutions via SCA, and finally round relaxed indicators back to binary values. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms in reducing the system cost while meeting the sensing and communication requirements.</description>

      <title>SREC: Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a typical paradigm of deep integration between artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technology, significantly improves communication efficiency and resource utilization efficiency. However, the security issues of SemCom are becoming increasingly prominent. Semantic features transmitted in plaintext over physical channels are easily intercepted by eavesdroppers. To address this issue, this paper proposes Encrypted Semantic Super-Resolution Enhanced Communication (SREC) to secure SemCom. SREC uses the modulo-256 encryption method to encrypt semantic features, and employs super-resolution reconstruction method to improve the reconstruction quality of images. The simulation results show that in the additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) channel, when different modulation methods are used, SREC can not only stably guarantee security, but also achieve better transmission performance under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.</description>

      <title>KGRAG-SC: Knowledge Graph RAG-Assisted Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art semantic communication (SC) schemes typically rely on end-to-end deep learning frameworks that lack interpretability and struggle with robust semantic selection and reconstruction under noisy conditions. To address this issue, this paper presents KGRAG-SC, a knowledge graph-assisted SC framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation principles. KGRAG-SC employs a multi-dimensional knowledge graph, enabling efficient semantic extraction through community-guided entity linking and GraphRAG-assisted processing. The transmitter constructs minimal connected subgraphs that capture essential semantic relationships and transmits only compact entity indices rather than full text or semantic triples. An importance-aware adaptive transmission strategy provides unequal error protection based on structural centrality metrics, prioritizing critical semantic elements under adverse channel conditions. At the receiver, large language models perform knowledge-driven text reconstruction using the shared knowledge graph as structured context, ensuring robust semantic recovery even with partial information loss. Experimental results demonstrate that KGRAG-SC achieves superior semantic fidelity in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while significantly reducing transmission overhead compared to traditional communication methods, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating structured knowledge representation with generative language models for SC systems.</description>

      <title>SemSteDiff: Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom), as a novel paradigm for future communication systems, has recently attracted much attention due to its superiority in communication efficiency. However, similar to traditional communication, it also suffers from eavesdropping threats. Intelligent eavesdroppers could launch advanced semantic analysis techniques to infer secret semantic information. Therefore, some researchers have designed Semantic Steganography Communication (SemSteCom) scheme to confuse semantic eavesdroppers. However, the state-of-the-art SemSteCom schemes for image transmission rely on the pre-selected cover image, which limits the universality. To address this issue, we propose a Generative Diffusion Model-based Coverless Semantic Steganography Communication (SemSteDiff) scheme to hide secret images into generated stego images. The semantic related private and public keys enable legitimate receiver to decode secret images correctly while the eavesdropper without completely true key-pairs fail to obtain them. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the plug-and-play design in different Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) frameworks. The comparison results under different eavesdroppers' threats show that, when Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) = 0 dB, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the legitimate receiver is 4.14 dB higher than that of the eavesdropper.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fronthaul Link Compression in Wireless Communication Systems: Review and Method Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern fronthaul links in wireless systems must transport high-dimensional signals under stringent bandwidth and latency constraints, which makes compression indispensable. Traditional strategies such as compressed sensing, scalar quantization, and fixed-codec pipelines often rely on restrictive priors, degrade sharply at high compression ratios, and are hard to tune across channels and deployments. Recent progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought end-to-end learned transforms, vector and hierarchical quantization, and learned entropy models that better exploit the structure of Channel State Information(CSI), precoding matrices, I/Q samples, and LLRs. This paper first surveys AI-driven compression techniques and then provides a focused analysis of two representative high-compression routes: CSI feedback with end-to-end learning and Resource Block (RB) granularity precoding optimization combined with compression. Building on these insights, we propose a fronthaul compression strategy tailored to cell-free architectures. The design targets high compression with controlled performance loss, supports RB-level rate adaptation, and enables low-latency inference suitable for centralized cooperative transmission in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Plug-and-Play Latent Diffusion for Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering with Application to Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) imaging is an important tool for non-invasive sensing with low-cost and portable devices. One emerging application is EM stroke imaging, which enables early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of brain strokes. Quantitative imaging is achieved by solving an inverse scattering problem (ISP) that reconstructs permittivity and conductivity maps from measurements. In general, the reconstruction accuracy is limited by its inherent nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Existing methods, including learning-free and learning-based approaches, fail to either incorporate complicated prior distributions or provide theoretical guarantees, posing difficulties in balancing interpretability, distortion error, and reliability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a posterior sampling method based on latent diffusion for quantitative EM brain imaging, adapted from a generative plug-and-play (PnP) posterior sampling framework. Our approach allows to flexibly integrate prior knowledge into physics-based inversion without requiring paired measurement-label datasets. We first learn the prior distribution of targets from an unlabeled dataset, and then incorporate the learned prior into posterior sampling. In particular, we train a latent diffusion model on permittivity and conductivity maps to capture their prior distribution. Then, given measurements and the forward model describing EM wave physics, we perform posterior sampling by alternating between two samplers that respectively enforce the likelihood and prior distributions. Finally, reliable reconstruction is obtained through minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation based on the samples. Experimental results on brain imaging demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction accuracy and structural similarity while maintaining high measurement fidelity.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Movable IRS-Aided ISAC Systems: Joint Beamforming and Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies, movable IRS (MIRS) has been proposed to improve the adaptability and performance of conventional IRS, enabling flexible adjustment of the IRS reflecting element positions. This paper investigates MIRS-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The objective is to minimize the power required for satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) of sensing and communication by jointly optimizing the MIRS element positions, IRS reflection coefficients, transmit beamforming, and receive filters. To balance the performance-cost trade-off, we proposed two MIRS schemes: element-wise control and array-wise control, where the positions of individual reflecting elements and arrays consisting of multiple elements are controllable, respectively. To address the joint beamforming and position optimization, a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed, where the variables are updated over a constructed product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) in parallel via penalty-based transformation and Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIRS outperforms conventional IRS in power minimization with both element-wise control and array-wise control. Specifically, with different system parameters, the minimum power is achieved by the MIRS with the element-wise control scheme, while suboptimal solution and higher computational efficiency are achieved by the MIRS with array-wise control scheme.</description>

      <title>Coupled tensor models for probability mass function estimation: Part I, Principles and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a Probability Mass Function (PMF) estimation method which tames the curse of dimensionality is proposed. This method, called Partial Coupled Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D, has for principle to partially couple order-3 data projections -- seen as order-3 tensors -- to obtain a tensor decomposition of the probability mass tensor. The novelty of PCTF3D relies on partial coupling which consists in choosing a subset of 3D marginals. The choice of marginals is then formulated with hypergraphs. After presenting possible coupling strategies, some numerical experiments and an application of the method are proposed. This article is the first of a two-part article. While this first article focuses on a new algorithmic framework for PMF estimation, the second studies uniqueness properties of the model introduced in this article.</description>

      <title>Coupled tensor models for probability mass function estimation: Part II, Uniqueness of the model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, uniqueness properties of a coupled tensor model are studied. This new coupled tensor model is used in a new method called Partial Coupled Tensor Factorization of 3D marginals or PCTF3D. This method performs estimation of probability mass functions by coupling 3D marginals, seen as order-3 tensors. The core novelty of PCTF3D's approach (detailed in the part I article) relies on the partial coupling which consists on the choice of 3D marginals to be coupled. Tensor methods are ubiquitous in many applications of statistical learning, with their biggest advantage of having strong uniqueness properties. In this paper, the uniqueness properties of PCTF3D's constrained coupled low-rank model is assessed. While probabilistic constraints of the coupled model are handled properly, it is shown that uniqueness highly depends on the coupling used in PCTF3D. After proposing a Jacobian algorithm providing maximum recoverable rank, different coupling strategies presented in the Part I article are examined with respect to their uniqueness properties. Finally, an identifiability bound is given for a so-called Cartesian coupling which permits enhancing sufficient bounds of the literature.</description>

      <title>ROPE: A Novel Method for Real-Time Phase Estimation of Complex Biological Rhythms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate phase estimation -- the process of assigning phase values between $0$ and $2\pi$ to repetitive or periodic signals -- is a cornerstone in the analysis of oscillatory signals across diverse fields, from neuroscience to robotics, where it is fundamental, e.g., to understanding coordination in neural networks, cardiorespiratory coupling, and human-robot interaction. However, existing methods are often limited to offline processing and/or constrained to one-dimensional signals. In this paper, we introduce ROPE, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first phase-estimation algorithm capable of (i) handling signals of arbitrary dimension and (ii) operating in real-time, with minimal error. ROPE identifies repetitions within the signal to segment it into (pseudo-)periods and assigns phase values by performing efficient, tractable searches over previous signal segments. We extensively validate the algorithm on a variety of signal types, including trajectories from chaotic dynamical systems, human motion-capture data, and electrocardiographic recordings. Our results demonstrate that ROPE is robust against noise and signal drift, and achieves significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art phase estimation methods. This advancement enables real-time analysis of complex biological rhythms, opening new pathways, for example, for early diagnosis of pathological rhythm disruptions and developing rhythm-based therapeutic interventions in neurological and cardiovascular disorders.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values (intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>CPEP: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training Enhances Gesture Generalization on EMG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04699v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.</description>

      <title>Lightweight DNN for Full-Band Speech Denoising on Mobile Devices: Exploiting Long and Short Temporal Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech denoising (SD) is an important task of many, if not all, modern signal processing chains used in devices and for everyday-life applications. While there are many published and powerful deep neural network (DNN)-based methods for SD, few are optimized for resource-constrained platforms such as mobile devices. Additionally, most DNN-based methods for SD are not focusing on full-band (FB) signals, i.e. having 48 kHz sampling rate, and/or low latency cases. In this paper we present a causal, low latency, and lightweight DNN-based method for full-band SD, leveraging both short and long temporal patterns. The method is based on a modified UNet architecture employing look-back frames, temporal spanning of convolutional kernels, and recurrent neural networks for exploiting short and long temporal patterns in the signal and estimated denoising mask. The DNN operates on a causal frame-by-frame basis taking as an input the STFT magnitude, utilizes inverted bottlenecks inspired by MobileNet, employs causal instance normalization for channel-wise normalization, and achieves a real-time factor below 0.02 when deployed on a modern mobile phone. The proposed method is evaluated using established speech denoising metrics and publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving an (SI-)SDR value that outperforms existing FB and low latency SD methods.</description>

      <title>6G Channel Modeling: Requirement, Measurement, Methodology and Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICTs). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To achieve this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for six promising technologies enabling 6G, including ISAC, extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), mid-band and terahertz (THz) technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs). A survey of the progress in 6G channel research regarding the above six promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. To support testing, optimization and evaluation, existing 6G channel simulators are summarized. Then, BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030 is introduced as an example of a simulator that was developed on the basis of the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. We also address open issues covering standardization activities, AI-enabled methods, and system performance analysis in the context of 6G channel research. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.</description>

      <title>RIS-Enabled NLoS Near-Field Joint Position and Velocity Estimation under User Mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of single-base station (BS) non-line-of-sight (NLoS) single-epoch localization with the aid of a reflective reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), this paper introduces a novel three-step algorithm that jointly estimates the position and velocity of a mobile user equipment (UE), while compensating for the Doppler effects observed in near-field (NF) at the RIS elements over the short transmission duration of a sequence of downlink (DL) pilot symbols. First, a low-complexity initialization procedure is proposed, relying in part on far-field (FF) approximation and a static user assumption. Then, an alternating optimization procedure is designed to iteratively refine the velocity and position estimates, as well as the channel gain. The refinement routines leverage small angle approximations and the linearization of the RIS response, accounting for both NF and mobility effects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through extensive simulations under diverse operating conditions with regard to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), UE mobility, uncontrolled multipath and RIS-UE distance. Our results reveal remarkable performance improvements over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) mobility-agnostic benchmark algorithm, while indicating convergence of the proposed algorithm to respective theoretical bounds on position and velocity estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) comprises detection and analysis of non-cooperative targets by exploiting the resources of the mobile radio system. In this context, micro-Doppler is of great importance for target classification, in order to distinguish objects with local movements. For developing algorithms for target classification, it is necessary to have a large amount of target signatures. Aiming to generate these data, this paper proposes a mathematical model for the micro-Doppler of drone rotating propellers, and validate the proposed model by comparing it to measured micro-Doppler. Results show that the proposed mathematical model can generate micro-Doppler data very similar to those from measurement data.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer Accelerator ASIC for Real-Time Low-Power Sleep Staging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents SleepViT, a custom accelerator ASIC for real-time, low-power sleep stage classification in wearable devices. At the core of SleepViT is a lightweight vision transformer model specifically optimized for electroencephalogram (EEG)-based sleep stage classification. The model is trained on the MASS SS3 dataset and achieves a classification accuracy of 82.9% across four sleep stages, while requiring only 31.6k weights-demonstrating its suitability for embedded inference. The proposed transformer is designed and synthesized in 65nm CMOS technology. To minimize power and area, the architecture adopts a novel layer-dependent fixed-point quantization scheme, variable data widths, and optimized memory access patterns. The synthesized accelerator occupies 0.754mm2 of silicon, operates at a maximum clock frequency of 379MHz, and consumes 6.54mW dynamic and 11.0mW leakage power over a 45.6ms inference window. With aggressive power gating during idle periods, the effective average power is 0.56mW, enabling extended battery life in wearable devices. This work highlights the feasibility of deploying transformer-based models in highly constrained edge environments and provides a pathway for future biomedical ASICs that require both real-time performance and ultra-low power consumption.</description>

      <title>A Meta-Fusion Architecture for Few-Shot Classification of Spike Waveforms in High-Bandwidth Brain-Machine Interfacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a need for fast adaptation in spike sorting algorithms to implement brain-machine interface (BMIs) in different applications. Learning and adapting the functionality of the sorting process in real-time can significantly improve the performance. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) depend on large amounts of data for training models and their performance sustainability decreases when data is limited. Inspired by meta-learning, this paper proposes a few-shot spike sorting (FS-SS) framework with variable network model size that requires minimal learning training and supervision. The framework is not only compatible with few-shot adaptations, but also it uses attention mechanism and dilated convolutional neural networks. This allows scaling the network parameters to learn the important features of spike signals and to quickly generalize the learning ability to new spike waveforms in recording channels after few observations. The FS-SS was evaluated by using freely accessible datasets, also compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method is 99.28%, which shows extreme robustness to background noise and similarity of the spike waveforms. When the number of training samples is reduced by 90%, the parameter scale is reduced by 68.2%, while the accuracy only decreased by 0.55%. The paper also visualizes the model's attention distribution under spike sorting tasks of different difficulty levels. The attention distribution results show that the proposed model has clear interpretability and high robustness.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformer-Based Flood Susceptibility Mapping: Application to the French Riviera and Railway Infrastructure Under Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increasing flood frequency and severity due to climate change threatens infrastructure and demands improved susceptibility mapping techniques. While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</description>

      <title>Secure Multi-Hop Relaying in Large-Scale Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a key enabler of borderless and ubiquitous connectivity, space-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSINs) are expected to be a cornerstone of 6G wireless communications. However, the multi-tiered and global-scale nature of SAGSINs also amplifies the security vulnerabilities, particularly due to the hidden, passive eavesdroppers distributed throughout the network. In this paper, we introduce a joint optimization framework for multi-hop relaying in SAGSINs that maximizes the minimum user throughput while ensuring a minimum strictly positive secure connection (SPSC) probability. We first derive a closed-form expression for the SPSC probability and incorporate this into a cross-layer optimization framework that jointly optimizes radio resources and relay routes. Specifically, we propose an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ optimal frequency allocation and power splitting strategy-dividing power levels of data transmission and cooperative jamming. We then introduce a Monte-Carlo relay routing algorithm that closely approaches the performance of the numerical upper-bound method. We validate our framework on testbeds built with real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>EEG Foundation Challenge: From Cross-Task to Cross-Subject EEG Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models are typically trained on small numbers of subjects performing a single task. Here, we introduce a large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges. First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second, the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128 channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly, predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.</description>

Abstract: This paper tackles two key challenges in cell-freemassive multiple input multiple output (CF-mMIMO) systems:efficient pilot allocation and practical receiver design. To thisend, we introduce a novel pilot allocation framework leveragingmanifold optimization to maximize the system sum rate, wherepilot sequences are designed as nearly orthogonal sequences. Theproposed pilot design enforces unimodularity constraints in thefrequency domain, ensuring pilots are suitable for both communi-cation and sensing tasks. Additionally, a gaussian belief propaga-tion (GaBP)-based receiver is introduced, providing near-optimaldetection performance with substantially reduced computationalcomplexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposedpilot allocation method achieves communication performancecomparable to state-of-the-art (SotA) algorithms, while deliveringsuperior sensing capabilities due to its unimodular pilot design.The GaBP-based receiver achieves robust performance andlower complexity compared to conventional approaches. Thesecontributions advance the practical deployment of CF-mMIMOfor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations, while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation. Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a complete signal-processing chain for multistatic integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) using 5G Positioning Reference Signal (PRS). We consider a distributed architecture in which one gNB transmits a periodic OFDM-PRS waveform while multiple spatially separated receivers exploit the same signal for target detection, parameter estimation and tracking. A coherent cross-ambiguity function (CAF) is evaluated to form a range-Doppler map from which the bistatic delay and radial velocity are extracted for every target. For a single target, bistatic delays are fused through nonlinear least-squares trilateration, yielding a geometric position estimate, and a regularized linear inversion of the radial-speed equations yields a two-dimensional velocity vector, where speed and heading are obtained. The approach is applied to 2D and 3D settings, extended to account for receiver clock synchronization bias, and generalized to multiple targets by resolving target association. The sequence of position-velocity estimates is then fed to standard and extended Kalman filters to obtain smoothed tracks. Our results show high-fidelity moving-target detection, positioning, and tracking using 5G PRS signals for multistatic ISAC.</description>
