      <title>Ordering digraphs with maximum outdegrees by their $A_{\alpha}$ spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a strongly connected digraph with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs. For any real $\alpha\in[0,1]$, the $A_\alpha$ matrix of a digraph $G$ is defined as $$A_\alpha(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1-\alpha)A(G),$$ where $A(G)$ is the adjacency matrix of $G$ and $D(G)$ is the outdegrees diagonal matrix of $G$. The eigenvalue of $A_\alpha(G)$ with the largest modulus is called the $A_\alpha$ spectral radius of $G$, denoted by $\lambda_{\alpha}(G)$. In this paper, we first obtain an upper bound on $\lambda_{\alpha}(G)$ for $\alpha\in[\frac{1}{2},1)$. Employing this upper bound, we prove that for two strongly connected digraphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ with $n\ge4$ vertices and $m$ arcs, and $\alpha\in [\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},1)$, if the maximum outdegree $\Delta^+(G_1)\ge 2\alpha(1-\alpha)(m-n+1)+2\alpha$ and $\Delta^+(G_1)&gt;\Delta^+(G_2)$, then $\lambda_\alpha(G_1)&gt;\lambda_\alpha(G_2)$. Moreover, We also give another upper bound on $\lambda_{\alpha}(G)$ for $\alpha\in[\frac{1}{2},1)$. Employing this upper bound, we prove that for two strongly connected digraphs with $m$ arcs, and $\alpha\in[\frac{1}{2},1)$, if the maximum outdegree $\Delta^+(G_1)&gt;\frac{2m}{3}+1$ and $\Delta^+(G_1)&gt;\Delta^+(G_2)$, then $\lambda_\alpha(G_1)+\frac{1}{4}&gt;\lambda_\alpha(G_2)$.</description>

      <title>Major Index Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0&lt;q&lt;1$, let $Maj$ be the distribution on the symmetric group $S_n$ such that a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is selected with probability proportional to $q^{maj(\pi)}$. The distribution has connections to $q$-Plancherel measure. We describe an algorithm that realizes $Maj$, and use it to prove known results of $q$-Plancherel measure without the need of representation theory. This sampler is transparent and elegant, allowing properties of $Maj$ about its limit shape, pattern normality, and cycle structure to be obtained.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Sets for 12 Cards is 14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel proof that the maximum number of sets with 4 properties for 12 cards is 14 using the geometry of the finite field F_3^4, number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. We also present several computer algorithms for finding the maximum number of sets. In particular, we show a complete set solver that iterates over all possible board configurations. We use this method to compute the maximum number of sets with 4 properties for a small number of cards, but it is generally too inefficient. However, with this method, we compute the maximum number of sets for 3 properties for all possible numbers of cards. We also present an algorithm for constructing near-optimal maximum sets.</description>

      <title>A classification of $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs with girth $6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph with diameter $D$ and valency $k \ge 3$. In [Homotopy in $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs, Discrete Math., {\bf 223} (2000), 189-206], H. Lewis showed that the girth of $\Gamma$ is at most $6$. In this paper we classify graphs that attain this upper bound. We show that $\Gamma$ has girth $6$ if and only if it is either isomorphic to the Odd graph on a set of cardinality $2D +1$, or to a generalized hexagon of order $(1, k -1)$.</description>

      <title>The $r$-chain minimal and maximal excludant sizes of an overpartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Andrews and Newman studied the minimal excludant of a partition, which is the smallest positive integer that is not a part of a partition. Chern introduced the maximal excludant of a partition, which is the largest nonnegative integer smaller than the largest part that is not a part of a partition. Bhoria, Eyyunnib, Maji and Li investigated the $r$-chain minimal and maximal excludants of a partition. In this article, we consider the $r$-chain minimal and maximal excludant sizes of an overpartition.</description>

      <title>Mutations and (Non-)Euclideaness in oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call an oriented matroid Mandel if it has an extension in general position which makes all programs with that extension Euclidean. If $L$ is the minimum number of mutations adjacent to an element of the groundset, we call an oriented matroid Las Vergnas if $L &gt; 0$. If $\frak{O}_{\mathcal{property}}$ is the class of oriented matroids having a certain property, it holds $\frak{O} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Las Vergnas}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Mandel}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{Euclidean}} \supset \frak{O}_{\mathcal{realizable}}.$ All these inclusions are proper, we give explicit proofs/examples for the parts of this chain that were not known.
  For realizable hyperplane arrangements of rank $r$ we have $L = r$ which was proved by Shannon. Under the assumption that a (modified) intersection property holds we give an analogon to Shannons proof and show that uniform rank $4$ Euclidean oriented matroids with that property have $L = 4$. Using the fact that the lexicographic extension creates and destroys certain mutations, we show that for Euclidean oriented matroids holds $L \ge 3$.
  We give a survey of preservation of Euclideaness and prove that Euclideaness remains after a certain type of mutation-flips. This yields that a path in the mutation graph from a Euclidean oriented matroid to a totally non-Euclidean oriented matroid (which has no Euclidean oriented matroid programs) must have at least three mutation-flips. Finally, a minimal non-Euclidean or rank $4$ uniform oriented matroid is Mandel if it is connected to a Euclidean oriented matroid via one mutation-flip, hence we get many examples for Non-Euclidean but Mandel oriented matroids and have $L \le 3$ for those of rank $4$.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Tur\'an problem on graph gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, if we glue them by identifying a given pair of vertices $u \in V(H_1)$ and $v \in V(H_2)$, what is the extremal number of the resulting graph $H_1^u \odot H_2^v$? In this paper, we study this problem and show that interestingly it is equivalent to an old question of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits on the Zarankiewicz problem. When $H_1, H_2$ are copies of a same bipartite graph $H$ and $u, v$ come from a same part, we prove that $\operatorname{ex}(n, H_1^u \odot H_2^v) = \Theta \bigl( \operatorname{ex}(n, H) \bigr)$. As a corollary, we provide a short self-contained disproof of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, which was recently disproved by Janzer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture of Verstra\"ete states that for any fixed $\ell &lt; k$ there exists a positive constant $c$ such that any $C_{2k}$-free graph $G$ contains a $C_{2\ell}$-free subgraph with at least $c |E(G)|$ edges. For $\ell = 2$, this conjecture was verified by K\"uhn and Osthus. We show that $C_6$ and $C_{2k}$ satisfy the conjecture for all odd $k$, but observe that a recent construction of a dense $C_{10}$-free subgraph of the hypercube yields a counterexample to the conjecture for $C_8$ and $C_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal de Bruijn Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A de Bruijn sequence of order $k$ over a finite alphabet is a cyclic sequence with the property that it contains every possible $k$-sequence as a substring exactly once. Orthogonal de Bruijn sequences are collections of de Bruijn sequences of the same order, $k$, satisfying the joint constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears as a substring in at most one of the sequences in the collection. Both de Bruijn and orthogonal de Bruijn sequences have found numerous applications in synthetic biology, although the latter topic remains largely unexplored in the coding theory literature. Here we study three relevant practical generalizations of orthogonal de Bruijn sequences where we relax either the constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears exactly once, or that the sequences themselves are de Bruijn rather than balanced de Bruijn sequences. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the number of fixed-weight orthogonal de Bruijn sequences.</description>

      <title>The completion numbers of Hamiltonicity and pancyclicity in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu(G)$ denote the minimum number of edges whose addition to $G$ results in a Hamiltonian graph, and let $\hat{\mu}(G)$ denote the minimum number of edges whose addition to $G$ results in a pancyclic graph. We study the distributions of $\mu (G),\hat{\mu}(G)$ in the context of binomial random graphs.
  Letting $d=d(n) := n\cdot p$, we prove that there exists a function $f:\mathbb{R}^+\to [0,1]$ of order $f(d) = \frac{1}{2}de^{-d}+e^{-d}+O(d^6e^{-3d})$ such that, if $G\sim G(n,p)$ with $20 \le d(n) \le 0.4 \log n$, then with high probability $\mu (G)= (1+o(1))\cdot f(d)\cdot n$.
  Let $n_i(G)$ denote the number of degree $i$ vertices in $G$. A trivial lower bound on $\mu(G)$ is given by the expression $n_0(G) + \lceil \frac{1}{2}n_1(G) \rceil$. In the denser regime of random graphs, we show that if $np-\frac{1}{3}\log n - 2\log \log n \to \infty$ and $G\sim G(n,p)$ then, with high probability, $\mu (G) = n_0(G) + \lceil \frac{1}{2}n_1(G) \rceil$.
  For completion to pancyclicity, we show that if $G\sim G(n,p)$ and $np\ge 20$ then, with high probability, $\hat{\mu} (G)=\mu (G)$.
  Finally, we present a polynomial time algorithm such that, if $G\sim G(n,p)$ and $np\ge 20$, then, with high probability, the algorithm returns a set of edges of size $\mu (G)$ whose addition to $G$ results in a pancyclic (and therefore also Hamiltonian) graph.</description>

      <title>On induced subgraphs of $H(n,3)$ with maximum degree $1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider induced subgraphs of the Hamming graph $H(n,3)$. We show that if $U \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ and $U$ induces a subgraph of $H(n,3)$ with maximum degree at most $1$ then
  1. If $U$ is disjoint from a maximum size independent set of $H(n,3)$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1}+1$. Moreover, all such $U$ with size $3^{n-1}+1$ are isomorphic to each other.
  2. For $n \geq 6$, there exists such a $U$ with size $|U| = 3^{n-1}+18$ and this is optimal for $n = 6$.
  3. If $U \cap \{x, x+e_1, x+2e_1\} \ne \phi$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1} + 729$.</description>

      <title>Shellability of $3$-Cut Complexes of Squared Cycle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$, the $k$-cut complex of a graph $G$ is the simplicial complex whose facets are the $(|V(G)|-k)$-subsets $\sigma$ of the vertex set $V(G)$ of $G$ such that the induced subgraph of $G$ on $V(G) \setminus \sigma$ is disconnected. These complexes first appeared in the master thesis of Denker and were further studied by Bayer et al.\ in [Topology of cut complexes of graphs, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2024]. In the same article, Bayer et al.\ conjectured that for $k \geq 3$, the $k$-cut complexes of squared cycle graphs are shellable. Moreover, they also conjectured about the Betti numbers of these complexes when $k=3$. In this article, we prove these conjectures for $k=3$.</description>

      <title>On strongly and robustly critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In extremal combinatorics, it is common to focus on structures that are minimal with respect to a certain property. In particular, critical and list-critical graphs occupy a prominent place in graph coloring theory. Stiebitz, Tuza, and Voigt introduced strongly critical graphs, i.e., graphs that are $k$-critical yet $L$-colorable with respect to every non-constant assignment $L$ of lists of size $k-1$. Here we strengthen this notion and extend it to the framework of DP-coloring (or correspondence coloring) by defining robustly $k$-critical graphs as those that are not $(k-1)$-DP-colorable, but only due to the fact that $\chi(G) = k$. We then seek general methods for constructing robustly critical graphs. Our main result is that if $G$ is a critical graph (with respect to ordinary coloring), then the join of $G$ with a sufficiently large clique is robustly critical; this is new even for strong criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the deformed Rogers-Szeg\"o functions ${\rm R}_{\alpha}(x,y;u,v|q)$. When $\alpha=-n$ is a negative integer, these functions are related to the $q$-derivatives of Ramanujan's partial Theta function. Basic properties of the polynomial ${\rm R}_{\alpha}$ are given, along with recurrence relations, its representations, and generating functions. We use the $u$-deformed $q$-exponential operator ${\rm T}(qD_{q}|u)$ to obtain identities for Rogers-Szeg\"o functions, in particular, Rogers-type formulas.</description>

      <title>About almost covering subsets of the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>

      <title>Three results towards the approximation of special maximum matchings in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ define the parameters $\ell(G)$ and $L(G)$ as the minimum and maximum value of $\nu(G\backslash F)$, where $F$ is a maximum matching of $G$ and $\nu(G)$ is the matching number of $G$. In this paper, we show that there is a small constant $c&gt;0$, such that the following decision problem is NP-complete: given a graph $G$ and $k\leq \frac{|V|}{2}$, check whether there is a maximum matching $F$ in $G$, such that $|\nu(G\backslash F)-k|\leq c\cdot |V|$. Note that when $c=1$, this problem is polynomial time solvable as we observe in the paper. Since in any graph $G$, we have $L(G)\leq 2\ell(G)$, any polynomial time algorithm constructing a maximum matching of a graph is a 2-approximation algorithm for $\ell(G)$ and $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for $L(G)$. We complement these observations by presenting two inapproximability results for $\ell(G)$ and $L(G)$.</description>

      <title>On the matching arrangement of a graph, improper weight function problem and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents examples of an application of the finite field method for the computation of the characteristic polynomial of the matching arrangement of a graph. Weight functions on edges of a graph with weights from a finite field are divided into proper and improper functions in connection with proper colorings of vertices of the matching polytope of a graph. An improper weight function problem is introduced, a proof of its NP-completeness is presented, and a knapsack-like public key cryptosystem is constructed based on the improper weight function problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and rainbow $k$-factors of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}=\{G_1,\ldots, G_{\frac{kn}{2}}\}$ be a set of graphs on the same vertex set $V=\{1,\dots,n\}$ where $k\cdot n$ is even. We say $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow $k$-factor if there exists a $k$-regular graph $F$ on the vertex set $V$ such that all edges of $F$ are from different members of $\mathcal{G}$. Guo, Lu, Ma, and Ma [Spectral radius and rainbow matchings of graphs, Linear Algebra Appl., 2023] showed a sufficient spectral condition for the existence of a rainbow 1-factor. In this paper, we extend this result to all $k$-factors for $k\geq 2$, which is that if $\rho(G_i)\geq\rho(K_{k-1}\vee(K_1\cup K_{n-k}))$ for each $G_i\in \mathcal{G}$, then $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow $k$-factor unless $G_1=G_2=\cdots=G_{\frac{kn}{2}}\cong K_{k-1}\vee(K_1\cup K_{n-k})$.</description>

      <title>Codes with symmetric distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a code $C$ in a space with maximal distance $n$, we say that $C$ has symmetric distances if its distance set $S(C)$ is symmetric with respect to $n / 2$. In this paper, we prove that if $C$ is a binary code with length $2n$, constant weight $n$ and symmetric distances, then \[
  |C| \leq \binom{2 n - 1}{|S(C)|}. \] This result can be interpreted using the language of Johnson association schemes. More generally, we give a framework to study codes with symmetric distances in Q-bipartite Q-polynomial association schemes, and provide upper bounds for such codes. Moreover, we use number theoretic techniques to determine when the equality holds.</description>

      <title>A Facet Enumeration Algorithm for Convex Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.11843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel and simple algorithm of facet enumeration for convex polytopes. The complexity of the algorithm is discussed. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab. Some simple polytopes with known H-representations and V-representations are used as the test examples. Numerical test shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Due to the duality between the vertex enumeration problem and facet enumeration problem, we expect that this method can also be used to solve the vertex enumeration problem.</description>

      <title>Hexagons govern three-qubit contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Cayley hexagons of order two are distinguished finite geometries living in the three-qubit symplectic polar space in two different forms, called classical and skew. Although neither of the two yields observable-based contextual configurations of their own, {\it classically}-embedded copies are found to fully encode contextuality properties of the most prominent three-qubit contextual configurations in the following sense: for each set of unsatisfiable contexts of such a contextual configuration there exists some classically-embedded hexagon sharing with the configuration exactly this set of contexts and nothing else. We demonstrate this fascinating property first on the configuration comprising all 315 contexts of the space and then on doilies, both types of quadrics as well as on complements of skew-embedded hexagons. In connection with the last-mentioned case and elliptic quadrics we also conducted some experimental tests on a Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computer to substantiate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Generalising the maximum independent set algorithm via Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple greedy algorithm to find a maximal independent set (MIS) in a graph starts with the empty set and visits every vertex, adding it to the set if and only if none of its neighbours are already in the set. In this paper, we consider (the complexity of decision problems related to) the generalisation of this MIS algorithm wherein any starting set is allowed. Two main approaches are leveraged. Firstly, we view the MIS algorithm as a sequential update of a Boolean network according to a permutation of the vertex set. Secondly, we introduce the concept of a constituency of a graph: a set of vertices that is dominated by an independent set. Recognizing a constituency is NP-complete, a fact we leverage repeatedly in our investigation.
  Our contributions are multiple: we establish that deciding whether all maximal independent sets can be reached from some configuration is coNP-complete; that fixing words (which reach a MIS from any starting configuration) and fixing permutations (briefly, permises) are coNP-complete to recognize; and that permissible graphs (graphs with a permis) are coNP-hard to recognize. We also exhibit large classes of permissible and non-permissible graphs, notably near-comparability graphs which may be of independent interest.
  Lastly, we extend our study to digraphs, where we search for kernels. Since the natural generalisation of our approach may not necessarily find a kernel, we introduce two further Boolean networks for digraphs: one always finds an independent set, and the other always finds a dominating set.</description>

      <title>Complexity of polytope diameters via perfect matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

      <title>Bounds for asymptotic characters of simple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important function attached to a complex simple Lie group $G$ is its asymptotic character $X(\lambda,x)$ (where $\lambda,x$ are real (co)weights of $G$) - the Fourier transform in $x$ of its Duistermaat-Heckman function $DH_\lambda(p)$ (continuous limit of weight multiplicities). It is shown in arXiv:2312.03101 that the best $\lambda$-independent upper bound $-c(G)$ for ${\rm inf}_x{\rm Re}X(\lambda,x)$ for fixed $\lambda$ is strictly negative. We quantify this result by providing a lower bound for $c(G)$ in terms of $\dim G$. We also provide upper and lower bounds for $DH_\lambda(0)$ when $|\lambda|=1$. This allows us to show that $|X(\lambda,x)|\le C(G)|\lambda|^{-1}|x|^{-1}$ for some constant $C(G)$ depending only on $G$, which implies the conjecture in Remark 17.16 of arXiv:2312.03101. We also show that $c(SL_n)\le (\frac{4}{\pi^2})^{n-2}$. Finally, in the appendix, which subsumes our previous paper arXiv:1811.05293, we prove Conjecture 1 in arXiv:1706.02793 about Mittag-Leffler type sums for $G$.</description>

      <title>Improved Upper Bounds on Key Invariants of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: De Loera, O'Neill and Wilburne introduced a general model for random numerical semigroups in which each positive integer is chosen independently with some probability p to be a generator, and proved upper and lower bounds on the expected Frobenius number and expected embedding dimensions. We use a range of probabilistic methods to improve the upper bounds to within a polylogarithmic factor of the lower bounds in each case. As one of the tools to do this, we prove that for any prime q, if A is a random subset of the cyclic group Z_q whose size is of order log(q) and k is also of order log(q), then with high probability the k-fold sumset kA is all of Z_q.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary operations on recursive lists. Within each recursive call, only two operations are required to generate all permutations (albeit in an unusual order): swapping the first two elements of the list or moving the last element to the front. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>
