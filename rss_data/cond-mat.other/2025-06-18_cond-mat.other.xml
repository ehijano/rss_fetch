      <title>Anomalous energy correlations and spectral form factor in the nonergodic phase of the $\beta$-ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\beta$-ensemble is a prototypical model of a single particle system on a one-dimensional disordered lattice with inhomogeneous nearest neighbor hopping. Corresponding nonergodic phase has an anomalous critical energy scale, $E_c$: correlations are present above and absent below $E_c$ as reflected in the number variance. We study the dynamical properties of the $\beta$-ensemble where the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In particular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time, $t_\mathrm{R} \equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the Heisenberg time, $t_\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level spacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\tau_\mathrm{R} \equiv t_\mathrm{R}/t_\mathrm{H} \ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\beta$. We show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window $t_\mathrm{R} &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This is in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system. We analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the spectral form factor of the $\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to the Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Universal solution to the Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) is an important perturbative method in quantum mechanics used to simplify Hamiltonians by decoupling low- and high-energy subspaces. Existing methods for implementing the SWT often lack general applicability to arbitrary perturbative systems or fail to provide a closed-form solution for the SWT generator. In this article, we present a systematic and unified framework for the SWT that addresses these shortcomings. Specifically, we derive a closed-form solution for the SWT generator that is universally applicable to any system that satisfies the conditions required for perturbative treatment. Furthermore, we extend this solution to time-dependent systems with periodic perturbations, covering all frequency regimes. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by applying it to analyze the dispersive shift of an anharmonic resonator coupled to a two-level system with time-dependent coupling.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC from configuration space sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation time grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure-dynamics correlation.</description>
