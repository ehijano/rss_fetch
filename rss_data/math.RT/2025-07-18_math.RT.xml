      <title>Subcategories of Module Categories via Restricted Yoneda Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for producing interesting subcategories of the category ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ of left $A$-modules, where $A$ is an associative algebra over a field $k$. The construction is based on the composition, $Y$, of the Yoneda embedding of ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ with a restriction to certain subcategories $\mathcal{B}\subset {}_A\mathsf{Mod}$, typically consisting of cyclic modules. We describe the subcategories on which $Y$ provides an equivalence of categories. This also provides a way to understand the subcategories of ${}_A\mathsf{Mod}$ that arise this way. Many well-known categories are obtained in this way, including categories of weight modules and Harish-Chandra modules with respect to a subalgebra $\Gamma$ of $A$. In other special cases the equivalence involves modules over the Mickelsson step algebra associated to a reductive pair of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Cactus flower spaces and monodromy of Bethe vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of cactus flower moduli spaces $\overline{F}_n$ and Gaudin models started in arXiv:2308.06880, arXiv:2407.06424. We show that isomorphism classes of operadic coverings of the real form $\overline{F}_n(\mathbb{R})$ are naturally one-to-one with equivalence classes of concrete coboundary monoidal categories (i.e. coboundary monoidal categories that admit a faithful monoidal functor to sets) with certain semisimplicity and finiteness conditions. Following the strategy of arXiv:1708.05105, for any complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we recover Kashiwara $\mathfrak{g}$-crystals, as a concrete coboundary category, from the coverings given by Bethe eigenlines for inhomogeneous Gaudin models. Using this, we compute the monodromy of Bethe eigenlines for trigonometric Gaudin models over two different real loci. In the particular case of minuscule highest weights, this can be regarded as combinatorial version of the wall-crossing conjecture of Bezrukavnikov and Okounkov for quantum cohomology of symplectic resolutions in the case of minuscule resolutions of slices in the affine Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>A basis and Schur-Weyl duality for the loop Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loop Hecke algebra is a generalization of the Hecke algebra to the loop braid group, introduced by Damiani, Martin and Rowell. We give a new presentation of the loop Hecke algebra provided a mild condition on the parameter and give a basis. We use higher linear rewriting theory to show linear independence and the combinatorics of Dyck paths to compute the cardinality of the basis. This yields a conjecture of Damiani-Martin-Rowel. We also give a representation theoretic interpretation of the loop Hecke algebra in terms of (non-semisimple) Schur-Weyl duality involving the negative half of quantum $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$.</description>

      <title>$2$-representation infinite algebras from non-abelian subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3$. Part II: Central extensions and exceptionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G \leq \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ be a non-trivial finite group, acting on $R = \mathbb{C}[x_1, x_2, x_3]$. We continue our investigation from arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] into when the resulting skew-group algebra $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra of a $2$-representation infinite algebra. We consider the subgroups arising from $\operatorname{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \hookrightarrow \operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$, called type (B), as well as the exceptional subgroups, called types (E) -- (L). For groups of type (B), we show that a $3$-preprojective structure exists on $R \ast G$ if and only if $G$ is not isomorphic to a subgroup of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ or $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. For groups $G$ of the remaining types (E) -- (L), every $R \ast G$ admits a $3$-preprojective structure, except for type (H) and (I). To prove our results for type (B), we explore how the notion of isoclinism interacts with the shape of McKay quivers. We compute the McKay quivers in detail, using a knitting-style heuristic. For the exceptional subgroups, we compute the McKay quivers directly, as well as cuts, and we discuss how this task can be done algorithmically. This provides many new examples of $2$-representation infinite algebras, and together with arXiv:2401.10720 [math.RT], arXiv:2505.10683 [math.RT] completes the classification of finite subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb{C})$ for which $R \ast G$ is a $3$-preprojective algebra.</description>

      <title>Arrow reductions for the finitistic dimension conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new techniques for removing arrows of bound quiver algebras, reducing thus the Finitistic Dimension Conjecture $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ for a given algebra to a smaller one. Unlike the classic arrow removal operation of Green-Psaroudakis-Solberg, our methods allow for removing arrows even when they occur in every generating set for the defining admissible ideal of the algebra. Our first main result establishes an equivalence for the finiteness of the finitistic (and global) dimensions of a ring $\Lambda$ and its quotient $\Lambda/K$, under specific homological and structural conditions on the ideal $K$, in the broader context of left artinian rings. The application of this result to bound quiver algebras suggests the notion of removability for sets of arrows, and we prove that successive arrow removals of this sort lead to a uniquely defined arrow reduced version of the algebra. Towards the opposite direction, we characterize generalized arrow removal algebras via removable multiplicative bimodules, and introduce trivial one-arrow extensions as a novel combinatorial construction for adding arrows while preserving the finiteness of the finitistic (and global) dimensions. All these new techniques are illustrated through various concrete bound quiver algebras, for which confirming the $\mathsf{(FDC)}$ had previously seemed intractable to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algebro-geometric interpretation of the Schur and Macdonald indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs). We conjecture that there exists an affine scheme $X$ such that the Hilbert series of the (appropriately-graded) arc space of its polynomial ring $J_\infty(\mathbb{C}[X])$ encodes the indices. Distinct local descriptions of a (singular) point correspond to distinct choices of $X$, giving rise to a family of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs each without a Higgs branch. These local descriptions directly translate into nilpotency relations in the operator product expansions. We test our conjecture across a variety of (generalized) Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories.</description>

      <title>Flows on Gentle Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of unit flows on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is known to admit regular unimodular triangulations induced by framings of the DAG. Amply framed DAGs and their triangulated flow polytopes have recently been connected with the representation theory of certain gentle algebras. We expand on this connection by defining a flow on the fringed quiver of an arbitrary gentle algebra. We call the space of unit flows its turbulence polyhedron. We show that support tau-tilting modules of a gentle algebra index a unimodular triangulation of its turbulence polyhedron. In the representation-infinite case, this triangulation is not complete and we give two different larger polyhedral dissections given by adding lower-dimensional walls to the picture. The turbulence polyhedron has a quotient map to what we define as the g-polyhedron lying in the ambient space of the g-vector fan, proving that gentle algebras are g-convex. Moreover, the images of our two types of walls under this quotient map provide two different interpretations for the complement of the g-vector fan of a gentle algebra.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Tensor Products, Group Representations, and Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here, we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the $\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank tensor completion problems.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements.
  The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We observe that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a matroid Schubert variety and prove that the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar {\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ are divisors indexed by root system data. We prove that $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety and find an affine paving of $\bar {\mathfrak h},$ where the strata are given by the orbits of $\mathfrak h.$ We show that the strata of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ correspond bijectively to subspaces of the corresponding Coxeter hyperplane arrangement studied by Orlik and Solomon, and prove that the associated posets are isomorphic. As a consequence, we express the Betti numbers of $\bar {\mathfrak h}$ in terms of well-known combinatorial invariants in the classical cases. We show that the Weyl group $W$ acts on $\bar {\mathfrak h}$, and describe $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb C)$ as a representation of $W$, and compute the cup product for $H^{\bullet}(\bar {\mathfrak h}, \mathbb Z)$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the Spread-Global Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by constructions from applied topology, there has been recent interest in the homological algebra of linear representations of posets, particularly in the context of homological algebra relative to non-standard exact structures. A prominent example is the spread exact structure on the category of representations of a fixed poset, in which the indecomposable projectives are the spread representations (that is, the indicator representations of convex and connected subsets). The spread-global dimension is known to be finite for finite posets and not uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between two arbitrary finite total orders. It was conjectured in [AENY23] that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite total order and an arbitrary finite total order. We provide a positive answer to this conjecture and, more generally, prove that the spread-global dimension is uniformly bounded on the collection of all Cartesian products between a fixed finite poset and an arbitrary finite total order. In doing so, we also establish the existence of finite spread-resolutions for finitely presented representations of arbitrary grid posets.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry and the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture predicts the existence of hypothetical "Breuil-Mezard cycles" in the moduli space of mod $p$ Galois representations of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_q/\mathbb{Q}_q)$ that should govern congruences between mod $p$ automorphic forms. For generic parameters, we propose a construction of Breuil-M\'{e}zard cycles in arbitrary rank, and verify that they satisfy the Breuil-M\'{e}zard Conjecture for all sufficiently generic tame types and small Hodge-Tate weights. Our method is purely local and group-theoretic, and completely distinct from previous approaches to the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture. In particular, we leverage new connections between the Breuil-M\'ezard Conjecture and phenomena occurring in homological mirror symmetry and geometric representation theory.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Diffeological Frobenius Reciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent paper [R22] established "Frobenius reciprocity" as a bijection $t$ between certain symplectically reduced spaces (which need not be manifolds), and conjectured: 1{\deg}) $t$ is a diffeomorphism when these spaces are endowed with their natural subquotient diffeologies, 2{\deg}) $t$ respects the reduced diffeological $2$-forms they may (or might not) carry. In this paper, we prove both this conjecture and a similar one on prequantum reduction, and also give new sufficient conditions for the reduced forms to exist. We stop short of proving that they always exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the configuration space of orbits, a generalization of the configuration space of points but for algebraic varieties that are acted by an algebraic reductive group. The main objective of this work is to study the $E$-polynomials of these spaces and their quotients by $S_n$. For this purpose, we develop a novel method for computing the $S_n$-equivariant $E$-polynomial of an algebraic variety, and we apply it to this kind of varieties.</description>
