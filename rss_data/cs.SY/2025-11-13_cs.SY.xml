      <title>MoE-GraphSAGE-Based Integrated Evaluation of Transient Rotor Angle and Voltage Stability in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale integration of renewable energy and power electronic devices has increased the complexity of power system stability, making transient stability assessment more challenging. Conventional methods are limited in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MoE-GraphSAGE, a graph neural network framework based on the MoE for unified TAS and TVS assessment. The framework leverages GraphSAGE to capture the power grid's spatiotemporal topological features and employs multi-expert networks with a gating mechanism to model distinct instability modes jointly. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that MoE-GraphSAGE achieves superior accuracy and efficiency, offering an effective solution for online multi-task transient stability assessment in complex power systems.</description>

      <title>Learning based Modelling of Throttleable Engine Dynamics for Lunar Landing Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical lunar landing missions involve multiple phases of braking to achieve soft-landing. The propulsion system configuration for these missions consists of throttleable engines. This configuration involves complex interconnected hydraulic, mechanical, and pneumatic components each exhibiting non-linear dynamic characteristics. Accurate modelling of the propulsion dynamics is essential for analyzing closed-loop guidance and control schemes during descent. This paper presents a learning-based system identification approach for modelling of throttleable engine dynamics using data obtained from high-fidelity propulsion model. The developed model is validated with experimental results and used for closed-loop guidance and control simulations.</description>

      <title>Energy-Workload Coupled Migration Optimization Strategy for Virtual Power Plants with Data Centers Considering Fuzzy Chance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.</description>

      <title>Recursive Binary Identification under Data Tampering and Non-Persistent Excitation with Application to Emission Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of online parameter estimation for cyber-physical systems with binary outputs that may be subject to adversarial data tampering. Existing methods are primarily offline and unsuitable for real-time learning. To address this issue, we first develop a first-order gradient-based algorithm that updates parameter estimates recursively using incoming data. Considering that persistent excitation (PE) conditions are difficult to satisfy in feedback control scenarios, a second-order quasi-Newton algorithm is proposed to achieve faster convergence without requiring the PE condition. For both algorithms, corresponding versions are developed to handle known and unknown tampering strategies, and their parameter estimates are proven to converge almost surely over time. In particular, the second-order algorithm ensures convergence under a signal condition that matches the minimal excitation required by classical least-squares estimation in stochastic regression models. The second-order algorithm is also extended to an adaptive control framework, providing an explicit upper bound on the tracking error for binary-output FIR systems under unknown tampering. Three numerical simulations verify the theoretical results and show that the proposed methods are robust against data tampering. Finally, the approach is validated via a vehicle emission control problem, where it effectively improves the detection accuracy of excess-emission events.</description>

      <title>Bus Type Switching to Reduce Bound Violations in AC Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wholesale power markets often use linear approximations of power system constraints. Because it does not consider inequality constraints, using AC power flow for feasibility post-processing can violate bounds on reactive power, voltage magnitudes, or thermal limits. There remains a need for a streamlined analytical approach that can guarantee AC feasibility while adhering to variable bounds. This paper suggests an augmented implementation of AC power flow that uses an additional two bus types (PQV and P) to help resolve voltage bound violations present in the traditional approach. The proposed method sacrifices the voltage setpoint at a generator in exchange for fixing the voltage at a load bus, thereby moving a degree of freedom around the network. Results on the IEEE 14-bus, 57-bus, and 300-bus test cases demonstrate how switching bus types can reduce overall network violations and help find feasible power system setpoints.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Control of Hypergraphs: Leveraging THIS to Damp Noise in Diffusive Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllability determines whether a system's state can be guided toward any desired configuration, making it a fundamental prerequisite for designing effective control strategies. In the context of networked systems, controllability is a well-established concept. However, many real-world systems, from biological collectives to engineered infrastructures, exhibit higher-order interactions that cannot be captured by simple graphs. Moreover, the way in which agents interact and influence one another is often unknown and must be inferred from partial observations of the system. Here, we close the loop between a hypergraph representation and our recently developed hypergraph inference algorithm, THIS, to infer the underlying multibody couplings. Building on the inferred structure, we design a parsimonious controller that, given a minimal set of controllable nodes, steers the system toward a desired configuration. We validate the proposed system identification and control framework on a network of Kuramoto oscillators evolving over a hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Strategic Decision-Making in Layered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility systems are complex socio-technical environments influenced by multiple stakeholders with hierarchically interdependent decisions, rendering effective control and policy design inherently challenging. We bridge hierarchical game-theoretic modeling with online feedback optimization by casting urban mobility as a tri-level Stackelberg game (travelers, operators, municipality) closed in a feedback loop. The municipality iteratively updates taxes, subsidies, and operational constraints using a projected two-point (gradient-free) scheme, while lower levels respond through equilibrium computations (Frank-Wolfe for traveler equilibrium; operator best responses). This model-free pipeline enforces constraints, accommodates heterogeneous users and modes, and scales to higher-dimensional policy vectors without differentiating through equilibrium maps.
  On a real multimodal network for Zurich, Switzerland, our method attains substantially better municipal objectives than Bayesian optimization and Genetic algorithms, and identifies integration incentives that increase multimodal usage while improving both operator objectives. The results show that feedback-based regulation can steer competition toward cooperative outcomes and deliver tangible welfare gains in complex, data-rich mobility ecosystems.</description>

      <title>ADMM Penalty Parameter Evaluation for Networked Microgrid Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful algorithm for solving decentralized optimization problems including networked microgrid energy management (NetMEM). However, its performance is highly sensitive to the selection of its penalty parameter \r{ho}, which can lead to slow convergence, suboptimal solutions, or even algorithm divergence. This paper evaluates and compares three district ADMM formulations to solve the NetMEM problem, which explore different methods to determine appropriate stopping points, aiming to yield high-quality solutions. Furthermore, an adaptive penalty heuristic is also incorporated into each method to analyze its potential impact on ADMM performance. Different case studies on networks of varying sizes demonstrate that an objective-based ADMM approach, denominated as OB-ADMM, is significantly more robust to the choice of \r{ho}, consistently yielding solutions closer to the centralized optimal benchmark by preventing premature algorithm stopping.</description>

      <title>Information-Driven Fault Detection and Identification for Multi-Agent Spacecraft Systems: Collaborative On-Orbit Inspection Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a global-to-local, task-aware fault detection and identification (FDI) framework for multi-spacecraft systems conducting collaborative inspection missions in low Earth orbit. The inspection task is represented by a global information-driven cost functional that integrates the sensor model, spacecraft poses, and mission-level information-gain objectives. This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators. An adaptive thresholding mechanism captures the time-varying inspection geometry and dynamic mission conditions. Simulation results for representative multi-spacecraft inspection scenarios demonstrate the reliability of fault localization and classification under uncertainty, providing a unified, information-driven foundation for resilient autonomous inspection architectures.</description>

      <title>Grid Operational Benefit Analysis of Data Center Spatial Flexibility: Congestion Relief, Renewable Energy Curtailment Reduction, and Cost Saving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are facilities housing computing infrastructure for processing and storing digital information. The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is driving unprecedented growth in data center capacity, with global electricity demand from data centers projected to double by 2026. This growth creates substantial challenges for power transmission networks, as large concentrated loads can cause congestion and threaten grid reliability. Meanwhile, the intermittent nature of solar and wind generation requires flexible resources to maintain grid reliability and minimize curtailment. This paper assesses whether data center spatial flexibility-the ability to migrate computational workloads geographically-can serve as a grid resource to address these challenges. An optimal power flow model is developed to co-optimize generation dispatch, security reserves, and flexible data center loads. Case studies on a modified IEEE 73-bus system show that inflexible data center placement can lead to severe transmission violations, with line overloads reaching 30.1%. Enabling spatial flexibility mitigates these violations in the studied scenarios and restores system feasibility. This flexibility also reduces solar curtailment by up to 61.0% by strategically reallocating load to solar-rich areas. The results suggest that spatial flexibility offers a viable approach to defer transmission upgrades and enhance renewable utilization.</description>

      <title>Discovering and exploiting active sensing motifs for estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From organisms to machines, autonomous systems rely on measured sensory cues to estimate unknown information about themselves or their environment. For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce "BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight. Collectively, our work will help decode active sensing strategies and inform the design of estimation algorithms in sensorimotor systems.</description>

      <title>Incorporating the nonlinearity index into adaptive-mesh sequential convex optimization for minimum-fuel low-thrust trajectory design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successive convex programming (SCP) is a powerful class of direct optimization methods, known for its polynomial complexity and computational efficiency, making it particularly suitable for autonomous applications. Direct methods are also referred to as ``discretize-then-optimize'' with discretization being a fundamental solution step. A key step in all practical direct methods is mesh refinement, which aims to refine the solution resolution by enhancing the precision and quality of discretization techniques through strategic distribution and placement of mesh/grid points. We propose a novel method to enhance adaptive mesh refinement stability by integrating it with a nonlinearity-index-based trust-region strategy within the SCP framework for spacecraft trajectory design. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through solving minimum-fuel, low-thrust missions, including a benchmark Earth-to-Asteroid rendezvous and an Earth-Moon L2 Halo-to-Halo transfer using the Circular Restricted Three-Body (CR3BP) model.</description>

      <title>An Improved Dual-Attention Transformer-LSTM for Small-Sample Prediction of Modal Frequency and Actual Anchor Radius in Micro Hemispherical Resonator Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-temperature glassblowing-fabricated micro hemispherical resonator (MHR) exhibits high symmetry and high Q-value for precision inertial navigation. However, MHR design entails a comprehensive evaluation of multiple possible configurations and demands extremely time-consuming simulation of key parameters combination. To address this problem, this paper proposed a rapid prediction method of modal frequency and actual anchor radius of designed MHR using an improved Transformer-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for rapid design sizing. High-temperature-induced softening deformation at the anchor point reduces the actual anchor radius below the designed value. By varying key parameters such as resonator height, anchor radius and edge thickness, finite element glassblowing simulation and modal analyse were conducted to obtain the first six modal frequencies and actual anchor radius. To address regression prediction challenges with limited data, dual multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanisms replaced the transformer's standard Feed Forward Network, to improve hidden information capture for high-accuracy predictions of modal frequencies and anchor radius. By checking fabricating feasibility of anchor radius and allowing rapid modal characteristics evaluation without interference, ablation and comparative experiments validated the method's superiority, as an effective support of MHR design. Design optimization experiments demonstrate a prediction accuracy of 96.35%, with computational time reduced to 1/48,000 of traditional finite element methods, significantly improving design efficiency. This study offers a new paradigm for intelligent Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) device design under complex process conditions.</description>

      <title>Validating Warehouse Picking Strategies Using Simulation: Case Study of a Plumbing Equipment Firm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today competitive business environment, efficient logistics are essential, especially in industries where timely delivery matters. This research aims to improve warehouse picking cycle time through simulation-based analysis, using a leading plumbing equipment distributor in Thailand as a case study. The study identifies inefficiencies such as disorganized storage and poor placement of high-frequency items that slow down picking. To address this, an optimized storage approach using ABC analysis is proposed, prioritizing high-demand items near the entrance. Three storage policies-Fixed, Random, and Combination (Fixed Zone)-are tested with a Zone Picking strategy through simulation to identify the most efficient picking routes. The findings provide insights for improving warehouse layout and inventory placement to enhance overall performance.</description>

      <title>Assumed Density Filtering and Smoothing with Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother are optimal for state estimation in linear dynamic systems. With nonlinear systems, the challenge consists in how to propagate uncertainty through the state transitions and output function. For the case of a neural network model, we enable accurate uncertainty propagation using a recent state-of-the-art analytic formula for computing the mean and covariance of a deep neural network with Gaussian input. We argue that cross entropy is a more appropriate performance metric than RMSE for evaluating the accuracy of filters and smoothers. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for state estimation on a stochastic Lorenz system and a Wiener system, and find that our method enables more optimal linear quadratic regulation when the state estimate is used for feedback.</description>

      <title>RIS-based Communication Enhancement and Location Privacy Protection in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security of efficient UAV networks has become increasingly critical. Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy.</description>

      <title>Unifying Sequential Quadratic Programming and Linear-Parameter-Varying Algorithms for Real-Time Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that connects sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and the iterative linear-parameter-varying model predictive control (LPV-MPC) technique. Using the differential formulation of the LPV-MPC, we demonstrate how SQP and LPV-MPC can be unified through a specific choice of scheduling variable and the 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) embedding technique and compare their convergence properties. This enables the unification of the zero-order approach of SQP with the LPV-MPC scheduling technique to enhance the computational efficiency of stochastic and robust MPC problems. To demonstrate our findings, we compare the two schemes in a simulation example. Finally, we present real-time feasibility and performance of the zeroorder LPV-MPC approach by applying it to Gaussian process (GP)-based MPC for autonomous racing with real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Management of IoT Nodes: Balancing Informational Value with Energy Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operational lifetime of energy-harvesting wireless sensor nodes is limited by availability of the energy source and the capacity of the installed energy buffer. When a sensor node depletes its energy reserves, manual intervention is often required to resume node operation. While lowering the duty cycle would help extend the network lifetime, this is often undesirable, especially in time-critical applications, where rapid collection and dissemination of information is vital. In this paper, we propose a context-aware energy management policy that helps balance the two opposing objectives of timely data collection and dissemination with energy conservation. We capture these objectives through the Value of Information (VoI) of observations made by a sensor node and the State of Energy (SoE) of the energy buffer. We formulate the energy management policy as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem which computes device sampling and transmission frequencies to maximize a defined utility criterion over a finite, receding, time-horizon. In the process, we also develop a unique mathematical representation for VoI, that adequately captures aspects related to continuity in monitoring, urgency of dissemination, and representation of the phenomena being observed. In the end, we use data collected from a real-world flash flood event, to evaluate our decision framework across multiple scenarios of energy availability.</description>

      <title>Steering Opinion Dynamics in Signed Time-Varying Networks via External Control Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies targeted opinion formation in multi-agent systems evolving over signed, time-varying directed graphs. The dynamics of each agent's state follow a Laplacian-based update rule driven by both cooperative and antagonistic interactions in the presence of exogenous factors. We formulate these exogenous factors as external control inputs and establish a suitable controller design methodology enabling collective opinion to converge to any desired steady-state configuration, superseding the natural emergent clustering or polarization behavior imposed by persistently structurally balanced influential root nodes. Our approach leverages upper Dini derivative analysis and Gr\"onwall-type inequalities to establish exponential convergence for opinion magnitude towards the desired steady state configuration on networks with uniform quasi-strong $\delta$-connectivity. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Runtime Safety and Reach-avoid Prediction of Stochastic Systems via Observation-aware Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems have emerged as fundamental models across numerous application domains, providing powerful mathematical representations for capturing uncertain system behavior. In this paper, we address the problem of runtime safety and reach-avoid probability prediction for discrete-time stochastic systems with online observations, i.e., estimating the probability that the system satisfies a given safety or reach-avoid specification. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on offline models, we propose a framework that incorporates real-time observations to dynamically refine probability estimates for safety and reach-avoid events. By introducing observation-aware barrier functions, our method adaptively updates probability bounds as new observations are collected, combining efficient offline computation with online backward iteration. This approach enables rigorous and responsive prediction of safety and reach-avoid probabilities under uncertainty. In addition to the theoretical guarantees, experimental results on benchmark systems demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Investigation of resonance between HVDC-MMC link and AC network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HVDC networks offer several advantages over traditional HVAC systems, particularly for long-distance power transmission and integration of renewable energy sources, such as reduced losses and enhanced stability and control, but also increase the risk of oscillations. This study investigates electrical resonant phenomena associated with HVDC stations through numerical EMT simulations. The findings indicate that electrical resonance is primarily pronounced in weak networks with long cables, as confirmed by the Nyquist criterion applied to frequency responses. Two real cases were successfully simulated in the time domain by introducing network changes, such as temporary faults and alterations in network's power strength, to activate the identified resonances. Notably, in a strong network with short cables, electrical resonance occurred alongside interactions between the network and the converter's protection system. The analysis of voltage waveforms revealed that the amplitude of the induced resonant harmonic dissipates quickly, indicating sufficient damping in the network configuration. Furthermore, the study confirmed the network's sensitivity to changes in converter parameters modeled using available MMC model.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation and Control for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems Based on Decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance State and Input Observers for heterogeneous multi-agent systems subject to bounded external disturbances. In the proposed input/state observer, each agent estimates the state and input of agents located two or more hops away using only local information exchanged with 1-hop neighbors, while guaranteeing that transient estimation errors satisfy predefined performance bounds. Conditions are established under which the input observer can be omitted, allowing the state observer convergence to be independent of the input estimates. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that if a closed-loop controller with full state knowledge achieves the control objective and the estimation-based closed-loop system is set-Input to State Stable (set-ISS) with respect to the goal set, then the estimated states can be used to achieve the system objective with an arbitrarily small worst-case error governed by the accuracy of the states estimates. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Security Index from Input/Output Data: Theory and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a security index quantifies the minimum number of components that must be compromised to carry out an undetectable attack. This metric enables system operators to quantify each component's security risk and implement countermeasures. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven security index that can be computed solely from input/output data when the system model is unknown. We show a sufficient condition under which the data-driven security index coincides with the model-based security index, which implies that the exact risk level of each component can be identified solely from the data. We provide an algorithm for computing the data-driven security index. Although computing this index is NP-hard, we derive a polynomial-time computable upper bound. Numerical examples on vehicle platooning illustrate the efficacy and limitations of the proposed index and algorithms.</description>

      <title>ATOM-CBF: Adaptive Safe Perception-Based Control under Out-of-Distribution Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08741v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and application of a general algorithm for Prediction And Control using MAchiNe learning (PACMAN) in DIII-D. Machine learing (ML)-based predictors and controllers have shown great promise in achieving regimes in which traditional controllers fail, such as tearing mode free scenarios, ELM-free scenarios and stable advanced tokamak conditions. The architecture presented here was deployed on DIII-D to facilitate the end-to-end implementation of advanced control experiments, from diagnostic processing to final actuation commands. This paper describes the detailed design of the algorithm and explains the motivation behind each design point. We also describe several successful ML control experiments in DIII-D using this algorithm, including a reinforcement learning controller targeting advanced non-inductive plasmas, a wide-pedestal quiescent H-mode ELM predictor, an Alfv\'en Eigenmode controller, a Model Predictive Control plasma profile controller and a state-machine Tearing Mode predictor-controller. There is also discussion on guiding principles for real-time machine learning controller design and implementation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Characterizing System Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.</description>

      <title>Distribution and Management of Datacenter Load Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploding power consumption of AI and cloud datacenters (DCs) intensifies the long-standing concerns about their carbon footprint, especially because DCs' need for constant power clashes with volatile renewable generation needed for grid decarbonization. DC flexibility (a.k.a. load adaptation) is a key to reducing DC carbon emissions by improving grid renewable absorption.
  DC flexibility can be created, without disturbing datacenter capacity by decoupling a datacenter's power capacity and grid load with a collection of energy resources. Because decoupling can be costly, we study how to best distribute and manage decoupling to maximize benefits for all. Key considerations include site variation and datacenter-grid cooperation.
  We first define and compute the power and energy needs of datacenter load decoupling, and then we evaluate designed distribution and management approaches. Evaluation shows that optimized distribution can deliver &gt;98% of the potential grid carbon reduction with 70% of the total decoupling need. For management, DC-grid cooperation (2-way sharing and control vs. 1-way info sharing) enables 1.4x grid carbon reduction. Finally, we show that decoupling may be economically viable, as on average datacenters can get power cost and carbon emissions benefits greater than their local costs of decoupling. However, skew across sites suggests grid intervention may be required.</description>

      <title>Modeling Closed-loop Analog Matrix Computing Circuits with Interconnect Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog matrix computing (AMC) circuits based on resistive random-access memory (RRAM) have shown strong potential for accelerating matrix operations. However, as matrix size grows, interconnect resistance increasingly degrades computational accuracy and limits circuit scalability. Modeling and evaluating these effects are therefore critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. Traditional SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulators, which rely on modified nodal analysis, become prohibitively slow for large-scale AMC circuits due to the quadratic growth of nodes and feedback connections. In this work, we model AMC circuits with interconnect resistance for two key operations-matrix inversion (INV) and eigenvector computation (EGV), and propose fast solving algorithms tailored for each case. The algorithms exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, enabling rapid and accurate solutions. Compared to SPICE, they achieve several orders of magnitude acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. We further extend the approach to open-loop matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) circuits, demonstrating similar efficiency gains. Finally, leveraging these fast solvers, we develop a bias-based compensation strategy that reduces interconnect-induced errors by over 50% for INV and 70% for EGV circuits. It also reveals the scaling behavior of the optimal bias with respect to matrix size and interconnect resistance.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on a Reliability Monitoring Framework for Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.</description>

      <title>BarrierBench : Evaluating Large Language Models for Safety Verification in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.

      <title>Adversarially and Distributionally Robust Virtual Energy Storage Systems via the Scenario Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an optimization model where a parking lot manager (PLM) can aggregate parked EV batteries to provide virtual energy storage services that are provably robust under uncertain EV departures and state-of-charge caps. Our formulation yields a data-driven convex optimization problem where a prosumer community agrees on a contract with the PLM for the provision of storage services over a finite horizon. Leveraging recent results in the scenario approach, we certify out-of-sample constraint safety. Furthermore, we enable a tunable profit-risk trade-off through scenario relaxation and extend our model to account for robustness to adversarial perturbations and distributional shifts over Wasserstein-based ambiguity sets. All the approaches are accompanied by tight finite-sample certificates. Numerical studies demonstrate the out-of-sample and out-of-distribution constraint satisfaction of our proposed model compared to the developed theoretical guarantees, showing their effectiveness and potential in robust and efficient virtual energy services.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Newton Compatible Actor-Critic for Deterministic Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Data-Driven Predictive Control with Equivalence to Stochastic MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15177v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven receding-horizon control method dealing with the chance-constrained output-tracking problem of unknown stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with partial state observation. The proposed method takes into account the statistics of the process noise, the measurement noise and the uncertain initial condition, following an analogous framework to Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC), but does not rely on the use of a parametric system model. As such, our receding-horizon algorithm produces a sequence of closed-loop control policies for predicted time steps, as opposed to a sequence of open-loop control actions. Under certain conditions, we establish that our proposed data-driven control method produces identical control inputs as that produced by the associated model-based SMPC. Simulation results on a grid-connected power converter are provided to illustrate the performance benefits of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Resilience-oriented Planning and Cost Allocation of Energy Storage Integrated with Soft Open Point Based on Resilience Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, frequent extreme events have put forward higher requirements for improving the resilience of distribution networks (DNs). Introducing energy storage integrated with soft open point (E-SOP) is one of the effective ways to improve resilience. However, the widespread application of E-SOP is limited by its high investment cost. Based on this, we propose a cost allocation framework and optimal planning method of E-SOP in resilient DN. Firstly, a cost allocation mechanism for E-SOP based on resilience insurance service is designed; the probability of power users purchasing resilience insurance service is determined based on the expected utility theory. Then, a four-layer stochastic distributionally robust optimization (SDRO) model is developed for E-SOP planning and insurance pricing strategy, where the uncertainty in the intensity of contingent extreme events is addressed by a stochastic optimization approach, while the uncertainty in the occurrence of outages and resilience insurance purchases resulting from a specific extreme event is addressed via a distributionally robust optimization approach. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified on the modified IEEE 33-bus DN.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-Process-based Adaptive Tracking Control with Dynamic Active Learning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes an active-learning-based adaptive trajectory tracking control method for autonomous ground vehicles to compensate for modeling errors and unmodeled dynamics. The nominal vehicle model is decoupled into lateral and longitudinal subsystems, which are augmented with online Gaussian Processes (GPs), using measurement data. The estimated mean functions of the GPs are used to construct a feedback compensator, which, together with an LPV state feedback controller designed for the nominal system, gives the adaptive control structure. To assist exploration of the dynamics, the paper proposes a new, dynamic active learning method to collect the most informative samples to accelerate the training process. To analyze the performance of the overall learning tool-chain provided controller, a novel iterative, counterexample-based algorithm is proposed for calculating the induced L2 gain between the reference trajectory and the tracking error. The analysis can be executed for a set of possible realizations of the to-be-controlled system, giving robust performance certificate of the learning method under variation of the vehicle dynamics. The efficiency of the proposed control approach is shown on a high-fidelity physics simulator and in real experiments using a 1/10 scale F1TENTH electric car.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Newton Extremum Seeking using Delays and Time-Periodic Gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study prescribed-time extremum seeking (PT-ES) for scalar maps in the presence of time delays. The PT-ES problem has been studied by Yilmaz and Krstic in 2023 using chirpy probing and time-varying gains that grow unbounded. To alleviate the gain singularity, in this paper we present an alternative approach, employing delays with bounded time-periodic gains, for achieving prescribed-time convergence to the extremum. Our results are not extensions or refinements of earlier works, but a new methodological direction --applicable even when the map has no delay. The main PT-ES algorithm compensates the map's delay and uses perturbation-based and the Newton (rather than gradient) approaches. With the help of averaging theorems in infinite dimension, specifically Retarded Functional Differential Equations (RFDEs), we conduct a prescribed-time convergence analysis on a suitable averaged target ES system, which contains the time-periodic gains of the map and feedback delays. We further extend our method to multivariable static maps and illustrate our results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Game Theory in Formula 1: From Physical to Strategic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05421v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework to model Formula 1 racing dynamics, where multiple cars interact physically and strategically. Aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management are integrated by means of physical models. We describe the minimum lap time problem with two agents as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game, and by employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions during the problem formulation, we recover the structure of a nonlinear program. In addition, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions, using the Nash costs as upper bounds. The resulting strategies are analyzed through case studies. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. Exploiting the structural similarities of the game formulations, we are able to compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals typical Formula 1 strategic behaviors. The proposed methodology closes the gap between theoretical game theory and real-world racing, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.</description>

      <title>A Matlab-based Toolbox for Automatic EMT Modeling and Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Modern Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intensive integration of power converters is changing the way that power systems operate, leading to the emergence of new types of dynamic phenomena and instabilities. At the same time, converters act as an interface between traditional AC grids and their more recent DC counterparts, giving rise to hybrid AC/DC networks. These conditions increase the necessity for stability analysis tools that can simultaneously account for the newly-introduced dynamic phenomena and can also be applied for the stability study of hybrid networks. This paper presents a Matlab-based toolbox for small-signal analysis of hybrid AC/DC power systems considering electromagnetic-transient (EMT) models. The toolbox allows the automatized modeling of the system from the input data and offers options for modal, impedance and passivity analyses. In the paper, the structure and internal processes of the toolbox are duly discussed, together with all its features, both main and complementary. Its capabilities for stability analysis are demonstrated via comprehensive case studies of converter-based system of various size and topology.</description>

      <title>Identifying the Smallest Adversarial Load Perturbation that Renders DC-OPF Infeasible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the globally smallest load perturbation that renders DC-OPF infeasible? Reliably identifying such "adversarial attack" perturbations has useful applications in a variety of emerging grid-related contexts, including machine learning performance verification, cybersecurity, and operational robustness of power systems dominated by stochastic renewable energy resources. In this paper, we formulate the inherently nonconvex adversarial attack problem by applying a parameterized version of Farkas' lemma to a perturbed set of DC-OPF equations. Since the resulting formulation is very hard to globally optimize, we also propose a parameterized generation control policy which, when applied to the primal DC-OPF problem, provides solvability guarantees. Together, these nonconvex problems provide guaranteed upper and lower bounds on adversarial attack size; by combining them into a single optimization problem, we can efficiently "squeeze" these bounds towards a common global solution. We apply these methods on a range of small- to medium-sized test cases from PGLib, benchmarking our results against the best adversarial attack lower bounds provided by Gurobi 12.0's spatial Branch and Bound solver.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized Linear-Quadratic Control with multiplicative noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.</description>

      <title>Optimising Communication Control Factors for Energy Consumption in Rural V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connected braking can reduce fatal collisions in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) by using reliable, low-latency 5G New Radio (NR) links, especially NR Sidelink Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X). In rural areas, road side units are sparse and power-constrained or off-grid, so energy efficiency must be considered alongside safety. This paper studies how three communication control factors including subcarrier spacing ($\mathrm{SCS}$), modulation and coding scheme ($\mathrm{MCS}$), and transmit power ($P_{\mathrm{t}}$) should be configured to balance safety and energy consumption in rural scenarios in light and heavy traffic scenarios. Safety is quantified by the packet receive ratio ($\mathrm{PRR}$) against the minimum communication distance $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, defined as the distance that the vehicle travels during the transmission of the safety message. Results show that, under heavy traffic, increasing $P_{\mathrm{t}}$ and selecting a low-rate $\mathrm{MCS}$ at $\mathrm{SCS} = 30$ kHz sustains high $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$, albeit with higher energy cost. In light traffic, maintaining lower $P_\mathrm{t}$ with low $\mathrm{MCS}$ levels achieves a favorable reliability-energy trade-off while preserving acceptable $\mathrm{PRR}$ at $D_{\mathrm{comm}}$. These findings demonstrate the necessity of adaptive, energy-aware strategy to guarantee both safety and energy efficiency in rural V2X systems.</description>

      <title>When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower whose intention is unknown to the leader. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) function is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. We study a setting in which the leader receives updated beliefs about the follower BR before the end of the game, such that the update prompts the leader and subsequently the follower to re-optimize their strategies. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop and feedback information structures. Interestingly, we prove that in general, assuming an incorrect follower's BR can lead to more optimal leader costs over the entire game than knowing the true follower's BR. We support these results with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game, and use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the instances of incorrect BR achieving lower leader costs are non-trivial in collision avoidance LQ Stackelberg games.</description>

      <title>Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound for Lyapunov-stable Neural Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning verifiably Lyapunov-stable neural controllers that provably satisfy the Lyapunov asymptotic stability condition within a region-of-attraction (ROA). Unlike previous works that adopted counterexample-guided training without considering the computation of verification in training, we introduce Certified Training with Branch-and-Bound (CT-BaB), a new certified training framework that optimizes certified bounds, thereby reducing the discrepancy between training and test-time verification that also computes certified bounds. To achieve a relatively global guarantee on an entire input region-of-interest, we propose a training-time BaB technique that maintains a dynamic training dataset and adaptively splits hard input subregions into smaller ones, to tighten certified bounds and ease the training. Meanwhile, subregions created by the training-time BaB also inform test-time verification, for a more efficient training-aware verification. We demonstrate that CT-BaB yields verification-friendly models that can be more efficiently verified at test time while achieving stronger verifiable guarantees with larger ROA. On the largest output-feedback 2D Quadrotor system experimented, CT-BaB reduces verification time by over 11X relative to the previous state-of-the-art baseline while achieving 164X larger ROA.</description>

      <title>SafeFlow: Safe Robot Motion Planning with Flow Matching via Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have led to promising results in robot motion planning, particularly through diffusion and flow matching (FM)-based models that capture complex, multimodal trajectory distributions. However, these methods are typically trained offline and remain limited when faced with new environments with constraints, often lacking explicit mechanisms to ensure safety during deployment. In this work, safe flow matching (SafeFlow), a motion planning framework, is proposed for trajectory generation that integrates flow matching with safety guarantees. SafeFlow leverages our proposed flow matching barrier functions (FMBF) to ensure the planned trajectories remain within safe regions across the entire planning horizon. Crucially, our approach enables training-free, real-time safety enforcement at test time, eliminating the need for retraining. We evaluate SafeFlow on a diverse set of tasks, including planar robot navigation and 7-DoF manipulation, demonstrating superior safety and planning performance compared to state-of-the-art generative planners.

      <title>Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backwards SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering potential algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</description>

      <title>Control-affine Schr\"odinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine It\^o diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schr\"odinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schr\"odinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</description>

      <title>Wide Tuning Range and Low Noise Voltage Control Oscillators for 5G Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the analytical design of a new wide tuning range and low-noise millimeter-wave voltage control oscillators (VCO) for 5G technology. The small signal model analysis and phase noise of the VCOs will be presented to evaluate the start-up oscillation condition, oscillation frequency, and phase noise affecting factors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the outperformance of the proposed cascode cross-couple LC VCO topology compared to the conventional cross-coupled LC VCO in terms of frequency tuning range, VCO gain and phase noise level.</description>
