      <title>Investigation of Shock-Capturing with Bound-Preserving Limiters for the Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) combines the key properties of provable nonlinear stability with the increased time step from energy-stable flux reconstruction. The NSFR scheme has been successfully applied to unsteady compressible flows. Through the use of a bound-preserving limiter, positivity of thermodynamic quantities is preserved, and this enables the extension of NSFR to hyperbolic conservation laws. We extend the limiter of Zhang and Shu [1] to ensure robustness for the proposed scheme. The limiter is modified to consider the minimum density and pressure at the solution nodes when determining the value to scale the solution. The modifications are thoroughly tested with a suite of test cases. In addition to these modifications, this paper conducts a thorough investigation into the shock-capturing capabilities of the NSFR scheme and the advantages it presents over standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, where, on select variants of the flux reconstruction (FR) scheme, essentially oscillation-free solutions are demonstrated. Various parameters of the scheme are extensively tested and analyzed through several 1D and 2D compressible Euler tests that verify the high-order accuracy, entropy stability, time step advantage and shock-capturing capabilities of the NSFR scheme. These parameters include the two-point flux, quadrature nodes and the strength of the FR parameter. In addition to investigating the impact of the various two-point fluxes, this paper also presents numerical studies to determine the CFL condition required to maintain positivity for the two-point flux of choice. The investigation yields insightful results for all parameters, with the results pertaining to the type of FR scheme being of special interest. The tests showcase increased robustness, time step advantages and oscillation/overshoot mitigation when employing a stronger FR parameter.</description>

      <title>Crack-tip field characterization in nonlinearly constituted and geometrically linear elastoporous solid containing a star-shaped crack: A finite element study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a three-dimensional (3-D) mathematical and computational framework for the characterization of crack-tip fields in star-shaped cracks within porous elastic solids. A core emphasis of this model is its direct integration of density-dependent elastic moduli, offering a more physically realistic representation of engineering materials where intrinsic porosity and density profoundly influence mechanical behavior. The governing boundary value problem, formulated for the static equilibrium of a 3-D, homogeneous, and isotropic material, manifests as a system of second-order, quasilinear partial differential equations. This system is meticulously coupled with classical traction-free boundary conditions imposed at the complex crack surface. For the robust numerical solution of this intricate nonlinear problem, we employ a continuous trilinear Galerkin-type finite element discretization. The inherent strong nonlinearities arising within the discrete system are effectively managed through a powerful and stable {Picard-type linearization scheme}. The proposed model demonstrates a remarkable ability to accurately describe the full stress and strain states in a diverse range of materials, crucially recovering the well-established classical singularities observed in linearized elastic fracture mechanics. A comprehensive numerical examination of tensile stress, strain, and strain energy density fields consistently reveals that these quantities attain their peak values in the immediate vicinity of the crack tip, an observation that remarkably aligns with established findings in standard linearized elastic fracture mechanics.</description>

      <title>Benchmark stress tests for flow past a cylinder at higher Reynolds numbers using EMAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a test problem for Navier-Stokes solvers based on the flow around a cylinder at Reynolds numbers 500 and 1000, where the solution is observed to be periodic when the problem is sufficiently resolved. Computing the resulting flow is a challenge, even for exactly divergence-free discretization methods, when the scheme does not include sufficient numerical dissipation. We examine the performance of the energy, momentum and angular momentum conserving (EMAC) formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. This incorporates more physical conservation into the finite element method even when the numerical solution is not exactly divergence-free. Consequently, it has a chance to outperform standard methods, especially for long-time simulations. We find that for lowest-order Taylor-Hood elements, EMAC outperforms the standard convective formulations. However, for higher-order elements, EMAC can become unstable on under-resolved meshes.</description>

      <title>Finite element modeling of V-notched thermoelastic strain-limiting solids containing inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise domain triangulation is recognized as indispensable for the accurate numerical approximation of differential operators within collocation methods, leading to a substantial reduction in discretization errors. An efficient finite element method (FEM) is presented in this paper, meticulously developed to solve a complex mathematical model. This model governs the behavior of thermoelastic solids containing both a V-notch and inclusions. The system of partial differential equations underlying this model consists of two primary components: a linear elliptic equation, which is used to describe the temperature distribution, and a quasilinear equation, which governs the mechanical behavior of the body. Through the application of this specifically tailored FEM, accurate and efficient solutions are able to be obtained for these intricate thermoelastic problems. The algebraically nonlinear constitutive equation, alongside the balance of linear momentum, is effectively reduced to a second-order quasi-linear elliptic partial differential equation. Complex curved boundaries are represented through the application of a smooth, distinctive point transformation. Furthermore, higher-order shape functions are employed to ensure the accurate computation of entries within the FEM matrices and vectors, from which a highly precise approximate solution to the BVP is subsequently obtained. The inherent nonlinearities in the governing differential equation are addressed through the implementation of a Picard-type linearization scheme. Numerical results, derived from a series of test cases, have consistently demonstrated a significant enhancement in accuracy, a crucial achievement for the nuanced analysis of thermoelastic solids.</description>

      <title>ORCHA -- A Performance Portability System for Post-Exascale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneity is the prevalent trend in the rapidly evolving high-performance computing (HPC) landscape in both hardware and application software. The diversity in hardware platforms, currently comprising various accelerators and a future possibility of specializable chiplets, poses a significant challenge for scientific software developers aiming to harness optimal performance across different computing platforms while maintaining the quality of solutions when their applications are simultaneously growing more complex. Code synthesis and code generation can provide mechanisms to mitigate this challenge. We have developed a toolchain, ORCHA, which arises from the needs of a large multiphysics simulation software, Flash-X, which were not met by any of the existing solutions. ORCHA is composed of three stand-alone tools -- one to express high-level control flow and a map of what to execute where on the platform, a second one to express variants of data structures and arithmetic operations in the solvers in a unified fashion, and a third one that manages the runtime orchestration of the data and computation. We use an application-specific interface layer that uses code generation and code synthesis to stitch together the application. In this paper, we describe the interface layer for the application Flash-X and demonstrate the use of ORCHA in exploring possible configurations from which the optimal one can be selected for production, including a case study in which a single simulation recipe is realized on three distinct hardware mappings -- a GPU-centric, a CPU/GPU balanced, and a CPU/GPU concurrent layouts -- highlighting the breadth of configurations ORCHA enables.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin method for one-dimensional nonlocal wave problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully discrete numerical scheme for one-dimensional nonlocal wave equations and provides a rigorous theoretical analysis. To facilitate the spatial discretization, we introduce an auxiliary variable analogous to the gradient field in local discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for classical partial differential equations (PDEs) and reformulate the equation into a system of equations. The proposed scheme then uses a DG method for spatial discretization and the Crank-Nicolson method for time integration. We prove optimal L2 error convergence for both the solution and the auxiliary variable under a special class of radial kernels at the semi-discrete level. In addition, for general kernels, we demonstrate the asymptotic compatibility of the scheme, ensuring that it recovers the classical DG approximation of the local wave equation in the zero-horizon limit. Furthermore, we prove that the fully discrete scheme preserves the energy of the nonlocal wave equation. A series of numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A modified tamed scheme for stochastic differential equations with superlinear drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit discretizations of stochastic differential equations often encounter instability when the coefficients are not globally Lipschitz. The truncated schemes and tamed schemes have been proposed to handle this difficulty, but truncated schemes involve analyzing of the stopping times while the tamed schemes suffer from the reduced order of accuracy. We propose a modified tamed scheme by introducing an additional cut-off function in the taming, which enjoys the convenience for error analysis and preserving the original order of explicit discretization. While the strategy could be applied to any explicit discretization, we perform rigorous analysis of the modified tamed scheme for the Euler discretization as an example. Then, we apply the modified tamed scheme to the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for sampling with super-linear drift, and obtain a uniform-in-time near-sharp error estimate under relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian dictionary learning estimation of cell membrane permeability from surface pH data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas transport across cell membrane is a very important process in biochemistry which is essential for many crucial tasks, including cell respiration pH regulation in the cell. In the late 1990's, the suggestion that gasses are transported via preferred gas channels embedded into the cell membrane challenged the century old Overton's theory that gases pass through the lipid cell membrane by diffusing across the concentration gradient. Since experimental evidence alone does not provide enough evidence to favor one of the proposed mechanisms, mathematical models have been introduced to provide a context for the interpretation of laboratory measurement. Following up on previous work where the membrane permeability was estimated using particle filter, in this article we propose an algorithm based on dictionary learning for estimating cell membrane permeability. Computed examples illustrate that the novel approach, which can be applied when the properties of the membrane do not change in the course of the data collection process, is computationally much more efficient than particle filter.</description>

      <title>Pyramid transforms via nonstationary subdivision schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pyramid transforms are constructive methods for analyzing sequences in a multiscale fashion. Traditionally, these transforms rely on stationary upsampling and downsampling operations. In this paper, we propose employing nonstationary subdivision schemes as upsampling operators that vary according to the refinement level. These schemes offer greater flexibility, enabling the development of advanced multiscale transforms, including geometric multiscale analysis. We establish the fundamental properties of these nonstationary operators and demonstrate their effectiveness in capturing and analyzing geometric features. In particular, we present applications to highlight their utility in detecting geometric structures in planar objects.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation Rate Guided Adaptive Sampling for Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Resolving Surface-Bulk Dynamics in Allen-Cahn Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Energy Dissipation Rate guided Adaptive Sampling (EDRAS) strategy, a novel method that substantially enhances the performance of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving thermodynamically consistent partial differential equations (PDEs) over arbitrary domains. EDRAS leverages the local energy dissipation rate density as a guiding metric to identify and adaptively re-sample critical collocation points from both the interior and boundary of the computational domain. This dynamical sampling approach improves the accuracy of residual-based PINNs by aligning the training process with the underlying physical structure of the system. In this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EDRAS using the Allen-Cahn phase field model in irregular geometries, achieving up to a sixfold reduction in the relative mean square error compared to traditional residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) methods. Moreover, we compare EDRAS with other residual-based adaptive sampling approaches and show that EDRAS is not only computationally more efficient but also more likely to identify high-impact collocation points. Through numerical solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation with both static (Neumann) and dynamic boundary conditions in 2D disk- and ellipse-shaped domains solved using PINN coupled with EDRAS, we gain significant insights into how dynamic boundary conditions influence bulk phase evolution and thermodynamic behavior. The proposed approach offers an effective, physically informed enhancement to PINN frameworks for solving thermodynamically consistent models, making PINN a robust and versatile computational tool for investigating complex thermodynamic processes in arbitrary geometries.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for high-dimensional solutions and snaking bifurcations in nonlinear lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for addressing key challenges in nonlinear lattices, including solution approximation, bifurcation diagram construction, and linear stability analysis. We first employ PINNs to approximate solutions of nonlinear systems arising from lattice models, using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to optimize network weights for greater accuracy. To enhance computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we integrate a stochastic sampling strategy. We then extend the method by coupling PINNs with a continuation approach to compute snaking bifurcation diagrams, incorporating an auxiliary equation to effectively track successive solution branches. For linear stability analysis, we adapt PINNs to compute eigenvectors, introducing output constraints to enforce positivity, in line with Sturm-Liouville theory. Numerical experiments are conducted on the discrete Allen-Cahn equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities in one to five spatial dimensions. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy comparable to, or better than, traditional numerical methods, especially in high-dimensional regimes where computational resources are a limiting factor. These findings highlight the potential of neural networks as scalable and efficient tools for the study of complex nonlinear lattice systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the swarming optimization problem as a weakly coupled, dissipative dynamical system governed by a controlled energy dissipation rate and initial velocities that adhere to the nonequilibrium Onsager principle. In this framework, agents' inertia, positions, and masses are dynamically coupled. To numerically solve the system, we develop a class of efficient, energy-stable algorithms that either preserve or enhance energy dissipation at the discrete level. At equilibrium, the system tends to converge toward one of the lowest local minima explored by the agents, thereby improving the likelihood of identifying the global minimum. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating significant advantages over traditional swarm-based gradient descent methods, especially when operating with a limited number of agents.</description>

Abstract: This work studies a stabilization technique for first-order hyperbolic differential equations used in DNA transcription modeling. Specifically we use the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards Model with a nonlinear Greenshield's velocity proposed in [1]. Standard finite element methods are known to produce spurious oscillations when applied to nonsmooth solutions. To address this, we incorporate stabilization terms involving spatial and temporal filtering into the system. We present numerical stability and prove convergence results for both the backwards Euler and time filtered formulations. We also present several computational results to demonstrate the rates in space and in time as well as for selected biological scenarios.</description>

      <title>A structural bound for cluster robustness of randomized small-block Lanczos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lanczos method is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm for solving large-scale symmetric eigenvalue problems. However, its rapid convergence can deteriorate significantly when computing clustered eigenvalues due to a lack of cluster robustness. A promising strategy to enhance cluster robustness -- without substantially compromising convergence speed or memory efficiency -- is to use a random small-block initial, where the block size is greater than one but still much smaller than the cluster size. This leads to the Randomized Small-Block Lanczos (RSBL) method. Despite its empirical effectiveness, RSBL lacks the comprehensive theoretical understanding already available for single-vector and large-block variants. In this paper, we develop a structural bound that supports the cluster robustness of RSBL by leveraging tools from matrix polynomials. We identify an intrinsic theoretical challenge stemming from the non-commuting nature of matrix multiplication. To provide further insight, we propose a conjectured probabilistic bound for cluster robustness and validate it through empirical experiments. Finally, we discuss how insights into cluster robustness can enhance our understanding of RSBL for both eigenvalue computation and low-rank approximation.</description>

Abstract: Multilayered poroelastic structures are found in many biological tissues such as cartilage and the cornea, and play a key role in the design of bioartificial organs and other bioengineering applications. Motivated by these applications, we study the interaction between a free fluid flow, governed by the time-dependent Stokes equations, and a multilayered poroelastic structure composed of a thick Biot layer and a thin, linear poroelastic plate located at the interface. The resulting equations are linearly coupled across the thin structure domain through physical coupling conditions. We develop a partitioned numerical scheme for this poroelastic fluid-structure interaction problem, combining the backward Euler Stokes-Biot splitting method with the fixed-strain Biot splitting approach. The first decouples the Stokes problem from the multilayered structure problem, while the second decouples the flow and mechanical subproblems within the poroelastic structures. Stability of the splitting scheme is proven under different combinations of time-step conditions and parameter constraints. The method is validated using manufactured solutions, and further applied to a biologically inspired blood vessel flow problem. We also demonstrate convergence of the solution to the limiting case without the plate as its thickness tends to zero, providing additional validation of the numerical method.</description>

      <title>The Divergence-Free Radiant Transform</title>

Abstract: This paper presents the rigorous mathematical construction and foundational properties of the Divergence-Free Radiant Transform (DFRT), a spectral transform specifically designed for divergence-free vector fields, with applications in incompressible fluid dynamics and other solenoidal systems. The DFRT basis functions are constructed using a curl-based formulation that ensures the divergence-free condition is satisfied identically. We define the forward and inverse transforms, prove the Parseval identity, and establish the completeness of the basis. The DFRT coefficient space is equipped with an algebraic structure via a spectral coboundary operator, defined using Wigner 3j and 6j symbols to encode angular momentum coupling. This cohomological structure, and its connection to the Geometric Refinement Transform (GRT), is developed in a companion paper using a bigraded cohomology framework. We derive a modal evolution equation for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in DFRT coordinates and introduce a persistent regularity class based on cohomological constraints. Finally, we present a variational argument showing that an entropy-maximizing energy distribution leads to exponential decay, offering a new perspective on regularity and singularity prevention in incompressible flows.</description>

      <title>Discrete reaction-diffusion system with stochastic dynamical boundary conditions: convergence results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A space discrete approximation to a highly nonlinear reaction-diffusion system endowed with a stochastic dynamical boundary condition is analyzed and the convergence of the discrete scheme to the solution to the corresponding continuum random system is established. A splitting strategy allows us to decompose the random system into a space-discrete heat equation with a stochastic boundary condition, and a nonlinear and nonlocal space-discrete differential system coupled with the first one and with deterministic initial and boundary conditions. The convergence result is obtained by first establishing some a priori estimates for both space-discrete splitted variables and then exploiting compact embedding theorems for time-space Besov spaces on the positive lattice. The convergence of a fully discrete approximation of the random system is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Discrete Differential Principle for Continuous Smooth Function Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taylor's formula holds significant importance in function representation, such as solving differential difference equations, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and further promotes applications in visual perception, complex control, fluid mechanics, weather forecasting and thermodynamics. However, the Taylor's formula suffers from the curse of dimensionality and error propagation during derivative computation in discrete situations. In this paper, we propose a new discrete differential operator to estimate derivatives and to represent continuous smooth function locally using the Vandermonde coefficient matrix derived from truncated Taylor series. Our method simultaneously computes all derivatives of orders less than the number of sample points, inherently mitigating error propagation. Utilizing equidistant uniform sampling, it achieves high-order accuracy while alleviating the curse of dimensionality. We mathematically establish rigorous error bounds for both derivative estimation and function representation, demonstrating tighter bounds for lower-order derivatives. We extend our method to the two-dimensional case, enabling its use for multivariate derivative calculations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to the finite forward difference method for derivative estimation and cubic spline and linear interpolation for function representation. Consequently, our technique offers broad applicability across domains such as vision representation, feature extraction, fluid mechanics, and cross-media imaging.</description>

      <title>Efficient FRW Transitions via Stochastic Finite Differences for Handling Non-Stratified Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of floating-random-walk (FRW) based capacitance extraction stands only when the recursive FRW transitions are sampled unbiasedly according to surrounding dielectrics. Advanced technology profiles, featuring complicated non-stratified dielectrics, challenge the accuracy of existing FRW transition schemes that approximate dielectrics with stratified or eight-octant patterns. In this work, we propose an algorithm named MicroWalk, enabling accurate FRW transitions for arbitrary dielectrics while keeping high efficiency. It is provably unbiased and equivalent to using transition probabilities solved by finite difference method, but at orders of magnitude lower cost (802$\times$ faster). An enhanced 3-D capacitance solver is developed with a hybrid strategy for complicated dielectrics, combining MicroWalk with the special treatment for the first transition cube and the analytical algorithm for stratified cubes. Experiments on real-world structures show that our solver achieves a significant accuracy advantage over existing FRW solvers, while preserving high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with Just-In-Time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters: The Analysis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a matrix that encodes pairwise distances in a finite metric space (or, more generally, the edge weight matrix of a network) under the barycentric coding model (BCM) with respect to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance function. We frame this task as estimating the unknown barycentric coordinates with respect to the GW distance, assuming that the target matrix (or kernel) belongs to the set of GW barycenters of a finite collection of known templates. In the language of harmonic analysis, if computing GW barycenters can be viewed as a synthesis problem, this paper aims to solve the corresponding analysis problem. We propose two methods: one utilizing fixed-point iteration for computing GW barycenters, and another employing a differentiation-based approach to the GW structure using a blow-up technique. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed GW analysis approach in a series of numerical experiments and applications to machine learning.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of the Policy Iteration for Infinite-Horizon Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy iteration (PI) is a widely used algorithm for synthesizing optimal feedback control policies across many engineering and scientific applications. When PI is deployed on infinite-horizon, nonlinear, autonomous optimal-control problems, however, a number of significant theoretical challenges emerge - particularly when the computational state space is restricted to a bounded domain. In this paper, we investigate these challenges and show that the viability of PI in this setting hinges on the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (GHJB) equation solved at each iteration. To ensure a well-posed iterative scheme, the GHJB solution must possess sufficient smoothness, and the domain on which the GHJB equation is solved must remain forward-invariant under the closed-loop dynamics induced by the current policy. Although fundamental to the method's convergence, previous studies have largely overlooked these aspects. This paper closes that gap by introducing a constructive procedure that guarantees forward invariance of the computational domain throughout the entire PI sequence and by establishing sufficient conditions under which a suitably regular GHJB solution exists at every iteration. Numerical results are presented for a grid-based implementation of PI to support the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We show how a recently published 2d model for traffic flow can be further improved. Besides other improvements and simplifications, we present not only a method to compute the necessary time step restrictions, but also a subcycling for the inflow and outflow. This drastically reduces computational cost on large domains with coarse grids, i.\,e.\ for simulations of a whole region instead of a small part of a city or town.</description>

      <title>Information geometric regularization of the barotropic Euler equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shock waves in gas dynamics feature jump discontinuities that hinder numerical simulations. Viscous regularizations are prone to excessive dissipation of fine-scale structures. In this work, we propose the first inviscid regularization of the multidimensional Euler equation based on ideas from semidefinite programming, information geometry, geometric hydrodynamics, and nonlinear elasticity. The Lagrangian flow maps of Euler solutions are a dynamical system on the manifold of diffeomorphisms. We observe that shock formation arises from the manifold's geodesic incompleteness. Our regularization embeds it into an ambient space equipped with the information geometry of the logarithmic barrier function. Thus, the diffeomorphism manifold inherits a geodesically complete geometry. The resulting regularized conservation law replaces shocks with smooth profiles without affecting oscillatory structures. One and two-dimensional numerical experiments show its practical potential to enable higher-order methods without explicit shock capturing. While we focus on the barotropic Euler equations for concreteness and simplicity of exposition, our regularization easily extends to more general Euler and Navier-Stokes-type equations. Our approach regularizes the Wasserstein geometry of the mass density with its information geometry. The former captures the natural trajectories of physical particles and the latter that of statistical estimators. Information geometric regularization accounts for the mass density's dual nature as a statistical/computational tool summarizing the motion of physical particles. Thus, our work is a starting point for information geometric mechanics that views solutions of continuum mechanical PDEs as parameters of statistical models for unresolved scales and uses their information geometry to evolve them in time.</description>

Abstract: We consider in this paper a numerical approximation of Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier- Stokes (PNP-NS) system. We construct a decoupled semi-discrete and fully discrete scheme that enjoys the properties of positivity preserving, mass conserving, and unconditionally energy stability. Then, we establish the well-posedness and regularity of the initial and (periodic) boundary value problem of the PNP-NS system under suitable assumptions on the initial data, and carry out a rigorous convergence analysis for the fully discretized scheme. We also present some numerical results to validate the positivity-preserving property and the accuracy of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Alternating Anderson-Picard Method for Nonlinear Fixed-point Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson Acceleration (AA) has been widely used to solve nonlinear fixed-point problems due to its rapid convergence. This work focuses on a variant of AA in which multiple Picard iterations are performed between each AA step, referred to as the Alternating Anderson-Picard (AAP) method. Despite introducing more ``slow'' Picard iterations, this method has been shown to be efficient and even more robust in both linear and nonlinear cases. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis for AAP in the nonlinear case. In this paper, we address this gap by establishing the equivalence between AAP and a multisecant-GMRES method that uses GMRES to solve a multisecant linear system at each iteration. From this perspective, we show that AAP ``converges'' to the Newton-GMRES method. Specifically, as the residual approaches zero, the multisecant matrix, the approximate Jacobian inverse, the search direction, and the optimization gain of AAP converge to their counterparts in the Newton-GMRES method. These connections provide insights for analyzing the asymptotic convergence properties of AAP. Consequently, we show that AAP is locally $q$-linear convergent and provide an upper bound for the convergence factor of AAP. To validate the theoretical results, numerical examples are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are various methods for modeling phase transformations in materials science, including general classes of phase-field methods and reactive diffusion methodologies, which most importantly differ in their treatment of interface energy. These methodologies appear mutually exclusive since the respective numerical schemes only allow for their primary use case. To address this issue, a novel methodology for modeling phase transformations in multi-phase, multi-component systems, with particular emphasis on applications in materials science and the study of substitutional alloys is introduced. The fundamental role of interface energy in the evolution of a material's morphology will be studied by example of binary and ternary systems. Allowing full control over the interface energy quantity enables more detailed investigations and bridges the gaps between known methods. We prove the thermodynamic consistency of the derived method and discuss several use cases, such as vacancy-mediated diffusion. Furthermore a scheme for relating Onsager and Diffusion coefficients is proposed, which allows us to study the intricate coupling that is observed in multicomponent systems. We hope to contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for modeling complex phase transformations in materials science.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Estimation Accuracy of 5 Different Numerical ODE Solvers on 3 Case Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers are indispensable tools in various engineering domains, enabling the simulation and analysis of dynamic systems. In this work, we utilize 5 different numerical ODE solvers namely: Euler's method, Heun's method, Midpoint Method, Runge-kutta 4th order and ODE45 method in order to discover the answer of three wellknown case studies and compare their results by calculation of relative errors. To check for the validity of the estimations, the experimental data of previous literature have been compared with the data in this paper which shows a good accordance. We observe that for each of the case studies based on the behavior of the model, the estimation accuracy of the solvers is different. For the logistic population change as the first case study, the results of all solvers are so close to each other that only their solution cost can be considered for their superiority. For temperature change of a building as the second case study we see that in some especial areas the accuracy of the solvers is different and in general Midpoint ODE solver shows better results. As the last case study, market equilibrium price shows that none of the numerical ODE solvers can estimate its behavior which is due to its sudden changing nature.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time weak error estimates of explicit full-discretization schemes for SPDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to long-time weak approximations of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) evolving in a bounded domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \leq 3$, with non-globally Lipschitz and possibly non-contractive coefficients. Both the space-time white noise ($d=1$) and the trace-class noise in multiple dimensions $d=2,3$ are examined for the considered SPDEs. Based on a spectral Galerkin spatial semi-discretization, we propose a class of novel full-discretization schemes of exponential type, which are explicit, easily implementable and preserve the ergodicity of the original dissipative SPDEs with possibly non-contractive coefficients. The uniform-in-time weak approximation errors are carefully analyzed in a low regularity and non-contractive setting, with uniform-in-time weak convergence rates obtained. A key ingredient is to establish the uniform-in-time moment bounds (in $L^{4q-2}$-norm, $q \geq 1$) for the proposed fully discrete schemes in a super-linear setting. This is highly non-trivial for the explicit full-discretization schemes and new arguments are elaborated by fully exploiting a contractive property of the semi-group in $L^{4q-2}$, the dissipativity of the nonlinearity and the particular benefit of the taming strategy. Numerical experiments are finally reported to verify the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A stabilized march approach to adjoint-based sensitivity analysis of chaotic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adjoint-based sensitivity analysis is of interest in computational science due to its ability to compute sensitivities at a lower cost with respect to several design parameters. However, conventional sensitivity analysis methods fail in the presence of chaotic flows. Popular approaches to chaotic sensitivity analysis of flows involve the use of the shadowing trajectory. The state-of-the-art approach computes the shadowing trajectory by solving a least squares minimization problem, resulting in a space-time linear system of equations. The current paper computes the adjoint shadowing trajectory using the stabilized march, by specifying the adjoint boundary conditions instead of solving a minimization problem. This approach results in a space-time linear system that can be solved through a single backward substitution of order $\mathcal{O}(n_u^2)$ with $n_u$ being the dimension of the unstable subspace. It is proven to compute sensitivities that converge to the true sensitivity for large integration times and that the error in the sensitivity due to the discretization is of the order of the local truncation error of the scheme. The approach is numerically verified on the Lorentz 63 and Kuramoto-Sivasinsky equations.</description>

      <title>Fast Bellman algorithm for real Monge-Ampere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new numerical algorithm for solving the Dirichlet problem for the real Monge--Ampere equation. The idea is to represent the non-linear Monge--Ampere operator as an infimum of a class of linear elliptic operators and use Bellman's principle to construct a numeric scheme for approximating the operator attaining this infimum.
  Moreover, we prove convergence of the proposed algorithm (under suitable technical assumptions) and discuss its strengths and weaknesses. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on several examples with various degrees of regularity and degeneracy and compare the results to two existing methods. Our method runs considerably faster than the ones used for comparison, improving the running time by a factor of 3--10 for smooth, strictly convex examples, and by a factor of 20--100 or more for mildly degenerate examples.</description>

      <title>Entropy numbers of classes defined by integral operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the following general approach. We study asymptotic behavior of the entropy numbers not for an individual smoothness class, how it is usually done, but for the collection of classes, which are defined by integral operators with kernels coming from a given class of functions. Earlier, such approach was realized for the Kolmogorov widths.</description>

      <title>Noise-robust multi-fidelity surrogate modelling for parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of constructing noise-robust surrogate models for quantities of interest (QoIs) arising from parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), using multi-fidelity collocation techniques; specifically, the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC). In practical scenarios, the PDE evaluations used to build a response surface are often corrupted by numerical noise, especially for the low-fidelity models. This noise, which may originate from loose solver tolerances, coarse discretisations, or transient effects, can lead to overfitting in MISC, degrading surrogate quality through nonphysical oscillations and loss of convergence, thereby limiting its utility in downstream tasks like uncertainty quantification, optimisation, and control. To correct this behaviour, we propose an improved version of MISC that can automatically detect the presence of solver noise during the surrogate model construction and then ignore the exhausted fidelities. Our approach monitors the spectral decay of the surrogate at each iteration, identifying stagnation in the coefficient spectrum that signals the onset of noise. Once detected, the algorithm selectively halts the use of noisy fidelities, focusing computational resources on those fidelities that still provide meaningful information. The effectiveness of this approach is numerically validated on two challenging test cases: a parabolic advection--diffusion PDE with uncertain coefficients, and a parametric turbulent incompressible Navier--Stokes problem. The results showcase the accuracy and robustness of the resulting multi-fidelity surrogate and its capability to extract relevant information, even from under-resolved meshes not suitable for reliable single-fidelity computations.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Successive Approximations for Non-convex Stochastic Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on finding approximate solutions to stochastic optimal control problems with control domains being not necessarily convex, where the state trajectory is subject to controlled stochastic differential equations. The control-dependent diffusions make the traditional method of successive approximations (MSA) insufficient to reduce the value of cost functional in each iteration. Without adding extra terms over which to perform the Hamiltonian minimization, the MSA becomes sufficient by our novel error estimate involving a higher order backward adjoint equation. Under certain convexity assumptions on the coefficients (no convexity assumptions on the control domains), the value of the cost functional descends to the global minimum as the number of iterations tends to infinity. In particular, a convergence rate is available for a class of generalized linear-quadratic systems.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and numerical analysis of an elapsed time model with strongly coupled neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elapsed time equation is an age-structured model that describes the dynamics of interconnected spiking neurons through the elapsed time since the last discharge, leading to many interesting questions on the evolution of the system from a mathematical and biological point of view. In this work, we deal with the case when the transmission after a spike is instantaneous and the case with a distributed delay that depends on the previous history of the system, which is a more realistic assumption. Since the instantaneous transmission case is known to be ill-posed due to non-uniqueness or jump discontinuities, we establish a criterion for well-posedness to determine when the solution remains continuous in time, through an invertibility condition that improves the existence theory under more relaxed hypothesis on the nonlinearity, including the strongly excitatory case. Inspired in the existence theory, we adapt the classical explicit upwind scheme through a robust fixed-point approach and we prove that the approximation given by this scheme converges to the solution of the nonlinear problem through BV-estimates and we extend the idea to the case with distributed delay. We also show some numerical simulations to compare the behavior of the system in the case of instantaneous transmission with the case of distributed delay under different parameters, leading to solutions with different asymptotic profiles.</description>

      <title>Transformers Can Solve Non-Linear and Non-Markovian Filtering Problems in Continuous Time For Conditionally Gaussian Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of attention-based deep learning models in stochastic filtering, e.g. transformers and deep Kalman filters, has recently come into focus; however, the potential for these models to solve stochastic filtering problems remains largely unknown. The paper provides an affirmative answer to this open problem in the theoretical foundations of machine learning by showing that a class of continuous-time transformer models, called \textit{filterformers}, can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-time (possibly non-Gaussian) measurements. Our approximation guarantees hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of continuous-time paths, where the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance between the true optimal filter and our deep learning model quantifies the approximation error. Our construction relies on two new customizations of the standard attention mechanism: The first can losslessly adapt to the characteristics of a broad range of paths since we show that the attention mechanism implements bi-Lipschitz embeddings of sufficiently regular sets of paths into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces; thus, it incurs no ``dimension reduction error''. The latter attention mechanism is tailored to the geometry of Gaussian measures in the $2$-Wasserstein space. Our analysis relies on new stability estimates of robust optimal filters in the conditionally Gaussian setting.</description>

      <title>Solving cluster moment relaxation with hierarchical matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convex relaxation methods are powerful tools for studying the lowest energy of many-body problems. By relaxing the representability conditions for marginals to a set of local constraints, along with a global semidefinite constraint, a polynomial-time solvable semidefinite program (SDP) that provides a lower bound for the energy can be derived. In this paper, we propose accelerating the solution of such an SDP relaxation by imposing a hierarchical structure on the positive semidefinite (PSD) primal and dual variables. Furthermore, these matrices can be updated efficiently using the algebra of the compressed representations within an augmented Lagrangian method. We achieve quadratic and even near-linear time per-iteration complexity. Through experimentation on the quantum transverse field Ising model, we showcase the capability of our approach to provide a sufficiently accurate lower bound for the exact ground-state energy.</description>

Abstract: We propose deep learning methods for classical Monge's optimal mass transportation problems, where where the distribution constraint is treated as penalty terms defined by the maximum mean discrepancy in the theory of Hilbert space embeddings of probability measures. We prove that the transport maps given by the proposed methods converge to optimal transport maps in the problem with $L^2$ cost. Several numerical experiments validate our methods. In particular, we show that our methods are applicable to large-scale Monge problems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Code Index Modulation Aided AFDM for Spread Spectrum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a new transmission waveform that has shown excellent performance in high-mobility environments, making it a sensible option for the next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate an energy-efficient generalized code index modulation scheme for AFDM by leveraging spread spectrum, referred to as GCIM-AFDM-SS, to combat the interference caused by the doubly dispersive channels. Specifically, the information bits are conveyed by the transmitted symbols as well as the indices of the selected spreading codes in our proposed GCIM-AFDM-SS scheme. To avoid extensive computations, we also develop a lowcomplexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) detector algorithm, which recovers the spreading codes first and demodulates the symbols afterwards. Moreover, an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed GCIM-AFDM-SS system with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is derived. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GCIM-AFDM-SS system over the classical AFDM spread spectrum (AFDM-SS) and the existing index modulated AFDM (IM-AFDM) systems.</description>

      <title>CIR bridge for modeling of fish migration on sub-hourly scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bridges, which are stochastic processes with pinned initial and terminal conditions, have recently been applied to various problems. We show that a bridge based on the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process, called a CIR bridge in this paper, reasonably models the intraday number of migrating fish at an observation point in a river. The studied fish migrates between sunrise and sunset each day, which are considered the initial and terminal times, respectively. The CIR bridge is well-defined as a unique pathwise continuous solution to a stochastic differential equation with unbounded drift and diffusion coefficients and potentially represents the on-off intermittency of the fish count data. Our bridge is theoretically novel in that it admits closed-form time-dependent averages and variances, with which the model parameters can be identified efficiently, and is computable by a recently-developed one-step numerical method. The CIR bridge is applied to the sub-hourly migration data of the diadromous fish Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis in the Nagara River, Japan, from February to June.</description>
