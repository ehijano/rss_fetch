      <title>Visual angle metric in the upper half plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an identity which connects the visual angle metric $v_{\mathbb{H}^2}$ and the hyperbolic metric $\rho_{\mathbb{H}^2}$ of the upper half plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. The proof is based on geometric arguments and uses computer algebra methods for formula manipulation. We also prove a sharp H\"older continuity result for quasiregular mappings with respect to the visual angle metric.</description>

      <title>Recursion formulas, concentration polytope, and sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities for the volume decomposition functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New sharp affine isoperimetric inequalities for volume decomposition functionals $X_{2}$ and $X_{3}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are established. To attack these extremal problems, we find the recursion formulas of volume decomposition functionals, then introduce concentration polytope and characterize its geometric structure, especially its vertices and $1$-dimensional faces. The concentration polytope intuitively reinterprets the discrete logarithmic Minkowski problem.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Comparison Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is based on Professor Vitali Kapovitch's comparison geometry course at the University of Toronto. It delves into various comparison theorems, including those by Rauch and Toponogov, with a focus on their applications such as Bishop-Gromov volume comparison, critical point theory of distance functions, diameter sphere theorem, and negative and nonnegative curvature. Additionally, it covers the soul theorem, splitting theorem, and covering theorem by Cheeger-Gromoll, as well as Perelman's proof on the soul conjecture. Finally, the note introduces Gromov-Hausdorff convergence, Alexandrov Spaces, and the Finite Homotopy type theorem by Grove-Peterson.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for unbounded closed convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central focus of this paper is the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for $C$-compatible sets, where $C$ is a pointed closed convex cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with nonempty interior. Such a problem deals with the characterization of the $(p, q)$-th dual curvature measure of a $C$-compatible set. It produces new Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations for unbounded convex hypersurface, often defined over open domains and with non-positive unknown convex functions. Within the family of $C$-determined sets, the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem is solved for $0\neq p\in \mathbb{R}$ and $q\in \mathbb{R}$; while it is solved for the range of $p\leq 0$ and $p&lt;q$ within the newly defined family of $(C, p, q)$-close sets. When $p\leq q$, we also obtain some results regarding the uniqueness of solutions to the $L_p$ dual Minkowski problem for $C$-compatible sets.</description>

      <title>Computing distances and means on manifolds with a metric-constrained Eikonal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing distances on Riemannian manifolds is a challenging problem with numerous applications, from physics, through statistics, to machine learning. In this paper, we introduce the metric-constrained Eikonal solver to obtain continuous, differentiable representations of distance functions on manifolds. The differentiable nature of these representations allows for the direct computation of globally length-minimising paths on the manifold. We showcase the use of metric-constrained Eikonal solvers for a range of manifolds and demonstrate the applications. First, we demonstrate that metric-constrained Eikonal solvers can be used to obtain the Fr\'echet mean on a manifold, employing the definition of a Gaussian mixture model, which has an analytical solution to verify the numerical results. Second, we demonstrate how the obtained distance function can be used to conduct unsupervised clustering on the manifold -- a task for which existing approaches are computationally prohibitive. This work opens opportunities for distance computations on manifolds.</description>

      <title>A regular $n$-gon spiral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a polygonal spiral by arranging a sequence of regular $n$-gons such that each $n$-gon shares a specified side and vertex with the $(n+1)$-gon in the construction. By offering flexibility for determining the size of each $n$-gon in the spiral, we show that a number of different analytical and asymptotic behaviors can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances from simply connected geodesic spaces to the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from the circle with its geodesic metric to any simply connected geodesic space is never smaller than $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We also prove that this bound is tight through the construction of a simply connected geodesic space $\mathrm{E}$ which attains the lower bound $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We deduce the first statement from a general result that we also establish which gives conditions on how small the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two geodesic metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ has to be in order for $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(Y)$ to be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Kohler-Jobin meets Ehrhard: the sharp lower bound for the Gaussian principal frequency while the Gaussian torsional rigidity is fixed, via rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we provide an adaptation of the Kohler-Jobin rearrangement technique to the setting of the Gauss space. As a result, we prove the Gaussian analogue of the Kohler-Jobin's resolution of a conjecture of P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"o: when the Gaussian torsional rigidity of a (convex) domain is fixed, the Gaussian principal frequency is minimized for the half-space. At the core of this rearrangement technique is the idea of considering a "modified" torsional rigidity, with respect to a given function, and rearranging its layers to half-spaces, in a particular way; the Rayleigh quotient decreases with this procedure.
  We emphasize that the analogy of the Gaussian case with the Lebesgue case is not to be expected here, as in addition to some soft symmetrization ideas, the argument relies on the properties of some special functions; the fact that this analogy does hold is somewhat of a miracle.</description>
