      <title>How a simple pendulum inside a running elevator oscillates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to effectively realize a time-dependent gravitational acceleration by using a running elevator, so that a simple pendulum inside it effectively becomes one with a time-dependent gravitational acceleration. We did such an experiment using a realistic elevator, and analyzed the data. The acceleration of an elevator is much smaller than the gravitational acceleration, and is time-dependent only when the elevator starts and stops. However, we have managed to establish the effect on the oscillation of the pendulum. The effect becomes pronounced if the simple pendulum is put in a container vertically accelerating, and the acceleration is time-dependent, while its magnitude is comparable with that of the gravitational acceleration.</description>

      <title>31 Lectures on Geometric Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This textbook for learning geometric mechanics is written in the format of lecture notes. These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey insight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format adopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be useful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:
  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry of Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations of motion.\smallskip
  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes geodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of flow. \smallskip
  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is left to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures containing well over sixty solved exercises.
  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the composition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale interactions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\'e framework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere dynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics such as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as Alfv\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The topics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents listed at the onset of each lecture.</description>

      <title>Revealing Invisible Scattering Poles via Complex Frequency Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in light scattering has prompted a re-evaluation of complex quantities, particularly in the context of complex frequency signals, which exhibit exponential growth or decay unlike traditional harmonic signals. We introduce a novel approach using complex frequency signals to reveal hidden or invisible poles--those with predominantly imaginary components--previously undetected in conventional scattering experiments. By employing a carefully tuned complex frequency excitation method, we demonstrate the efficient conversion of non-oscillating fields into oscillating ones. This effect is shown in both RF and optical domains, specifically within the C-band infrared spectral range, which is crucial for communications. This study enhances the theoretical framework of wave interactions in photonic systems, paving the way for innovative applications in invisibility cloaking, advanced photonic devices, and the future of optical communication and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Analytical Study of a Monolayered Vibroacoustic Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates a vibroacoustic phononic metamaterial system composed of repeated monolayered membrane-air cavity unit-cells to assess its efficacy in controlling sound waves. Assuming low-frequency axisymmetric modes, the coupled membrane-cavity vibroacoustic system for a representative unit-cell is solved entirely analytically. Unlike previous research that relied on an infinite series of eigenfunctions, our analysis offers a single-term exact solution for the membrane's displacement field, fully accounting for coupling with the acoustic cavities. Utilizing the transfer matrix method and the Bloch-Floquet theorem, we offer a comprehensive analytical characterization of the band structure, including closed-form analytical expressions for determining the bounding frequencies of the bandgaps and the dispersion branches. Interaction between Bragg and local resonance bandgaps is examined by adjusting Bragg bandgap positions, with detailed mathematical descriptions provided for their overlapping and transition. Additionally, a "plasma bandgap" analogous to metallic plasma oscillations is identified, with a derived analytical expression for its frequency. First two passbands remain robust against cavity depth variations, limiting wave manipulation capabilities. Analysis of the finite phononic system involves constructing the global transfer matrix to study natural frequencies and scattering coefficients. Interaction between Bragg and local resonance bandgaps in finite systems results in ultra-narrow passbands, creating transparency windows analogous to electromagnetically induced transparency by quantum interference. This theoretical framework enables precise characterization and engineering of bandgaps in the monolayered vibroacoustic phononic metamaterial, highlighting its potential for controlling low-frequency sound wave propagation across multiple frequencies.</description>
