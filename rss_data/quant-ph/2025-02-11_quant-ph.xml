      <title>Comment on arXiv:2307.08384 "Efficient Quantum State Preparation with Walsh Series"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the Walsh Series Loader (WSL) algorithm, proposed by. In particular, we observe that the paper does not describe how to implement the term of order zero of the operator WSL is based on. While this does not affect the theoretical validity of WSL, it poses obstacles for practitioners aiming to use WSL because, as we show in our experiments, an incorrect implementation leads to states with very poor fidelity. In this paper, we describe how to implement the full quantum circuit required by WSL, including the term of order zero, releasing our source code online, and show that the algorithm works correctly. Finally, we empirically show how, as was theoretically demonstrated in the original article, truncated WSL does not prepare well highly entangled states.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MOMDWA): A Novel Approach For Quantum System Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization algorithm, the Multi-Objective Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MOMDWA), specifically designed to address complex quantum control problems. Our approach extends the capabilities of the original Mobile Damped Wave Algorithm (MDWA) by incorporating multiple objectives, enabling a more comprehensive optimization process. We applied MOMDWA to three quantum control scenarios, focusing on optimizing the balance between control fidelity, energy consumption, and control smoothness. The results demonstrate that MOMDWA significantly enhances quantum control efficiency and robustness, achieving high fidelity while minimizing energy use and ensuring smooth control pulses. This advancement offers a valuable tool for quantum computing and other domains requiring precise, multi-objective control.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Models to Non-Gaussian Realms of Quantum Photonic Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum photonic simulators have emerged as indispensable tools for modeling and optimizing quantum photonic circuits, bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental implementations. This review explores the landscape of photonic quantum simulation, focusing on the transition from Gaussian to non-Gaussian models and the computational challenges associated with simulating large-scale photonic systems. Gaussian states and operations, which enable efficient simulations through covariance matrices and phase-space representations, serve as the foundation for photonic quantum computing. However, non-Gaussian states crucial for universal quantum computation introduce significant computational complexity, requiring advanced numerical techniques such as tensor networks and high-performance GPU acceleration. We evaluate the leading photonic quantum simulators, including Strawberry Fields, Piquasso, QuTiP SimulaQron, Perceval, and QuantumOPtics.jl analyzing their capabilities in handling continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems. Special attention is given to hardware-accelerated methods, including GPU-based tensor network approaches, machine learning integration, and hybrid quantum-classical workflows. Furthermore, we investigate noise modeling techniques, such as photon loss and dark counts, and their impact on simulation accuracy. As photonic quantum computing moves toward practical implementations, advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) architectures, such as tensor processing units (TPUs) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions, are accelerating the field. This review highlights emerging trends, challenges, and future directions for developing scalable and efficient photonic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum automated learning with provable and explainable trainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning is widely believed to be one of the most promising practical applications of quantum computing. Existing quantum machine learning schemes typically employ a quantum-classical hybrid approach that relies crucially on gradients of model parameters. Such an approach lacks provable convergence to global minima and will become infeasible as quantum learning models scale up. Here, we introduce quantum automated learning, where no variational parameter is involved and the training process is converted to quantum state preparation. In particular, we encode training data into unitary operations and iteratively evolve a random initial state under these unitaries and their inverses, with a target-oriented perturbation towards higher prediction accuracy sandwiched in between. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously prove that the evolution converges exponentially to the desired state corresponding to the global minimum of the loss function. We show that such a training process can be understood from the perspective of preparing quantum states by imaginary time evolution, where the data-encoded unitaries together with target-oriented perturbations would train the quantum learning model in an automated fashion. We further prove that the quantum automated learning paradigm features good generalization ability with the generalization error upper bounded by the ratio between a logarithmic function of the Hilbert space dimension and the number of training samples. In addition, we carry out extensive numerical simulations on real-life images and quantum data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the assumptions. Our results establish an unconventional quantum learning strategy that is gradient-free with provable and explainable trainability, which would be crucial for large-scale practical applications of quantum computing in machine learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Phase-Sensitive Enhanced Absorption, Transmission and Slow Light in a Cross-cavity Magnomechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a scheme to explore the magnetically and magnomechanically induced transparency phenomena in a cross-cavity magnomechanical system, focusing on the role of relative phase and the intensity of the two probing fields in enhancing the absorption and transmission spectra and manipulating the group delay of the transmitted light. Interestingly, the relative phase of the two probe fields could have overwhelming effects on both the absorption spectrum and the group delay of the output field. Tuning the relative phase and amplitude of the probe fields can suppress or enhance the absorption and transmission spectra. The combined effect of the magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings, along with relative phase modulations, helps to switch the probe field's behavior from subluminal to superluminal in the current system. The current study offers a straightforward and practical approach, demonstrating the capability to employ the relative phase for the modulation of microwave signals within the cavity magnomechanical system, providing insights for the design of information transduction and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Time Complexity of NISQ Shortest-Vector-Problem Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shortest Vector Problem is believed to be hard both for classical and quantum computers. Two of the three NIST post-quantum cryptosystems standardised by NIST rely on its hardness. Research on theoretical and practical performance of quantum algorithms to solve SVP is crucial to establish confidence in them. Exploring the capabilities that Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) that can run on NISQ devices have in solving SVP has been an active research area. The qubit-requirement for doing so has been analysed and it was demonstrated that it is plausible to encode SVP on the ground state of a Hamiltonian efficiently. Due to the heuristic nature of VQAs no analysis of the time complexity of those approaches for scales beyond the non-interesting classically simulatable sizes has been performed. Motivated by Boulebnane and Montanaro work on the k-SAT problem, we propose to use angle pretraining of the QAOA for SVP and we demonstrate that it performs well on much larger instances than those used in training. Avoiding the limitations that arise due to the use of optimiser, we are able to extrapolate the observed performance and observe the probability of success scaling as $2^{-0.695n}$ with n being dimensionality of the search space for a depth $p=3$ pre-trained QAOA. We observe time complexity $O(2^{0.695n})$, a bit worse than the fault-tolerant Grover approach of $O(2^{0.5n})$. However, both the number of qubits, and the depth of each quantum computation, are considerably better-Grover requires exponential depth, while each run of constant p fixed-angles QAOA requires polynomial depth. We also propose a novel method to avoid the zero vector solution to SVP without introducing more logical qubits. This improves upon the previous works as it results in more space efficient encoding of SVP on NISQ architectures without ignoring the zero vector problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Teleportation: A Novel Protocol Relaxing Previous Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state teleportation (QST) is a foundational protocol for transferring quantum information across long distances. Building on this concept, quantum energy teleportation (QET) was introduced to facilitate the transfer of energy. However, QET has traditionally been thought to impose much stricter constraints than QST, including the need for the initial state to be the ground state of a specific interacting Hamiltonian, for Alice's measurement to commute with the interaction terms, and for the ground state to exhibit entanglement. These constraints limit broader application of the QET protocol. In this work, we challenge these notions and demonstrate for the first time that none of these constraints are fundamentally necessary. We propose a novel QET protocol that relaxes all these constraints, offering a more flexible and generalized framework. Additionally, we introduce the concept of a "local effective Hamiltonian," which removes the need for optimization techniques in determining Bob's optimal energy extraction. These advancements enhance our understanding of QET and extends its broader applications for quantum technologies. To support our findings, we implement the protocol on quantum hardware, confirming its theoretical validity and experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>First-principle crosstalk dynamics and Hamiltonian learning via Rabi experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent errors constitute a significant barrier to successful large-scale quantum computation. One such error mechanism is crosstalk, which violates spatial locality or the independence of operations. We present a description of crosstalk and learn the underlying parameters by executing novel simultaneous Rabi experiments and fitting the Hamiltonian to the observed data. We use this model to predict three- and four-qubit experiments and observe excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental results. Our technique enables researchers to study the dynamics of multi-qubit circuits without performing experiments, potentially facilitating the minimization of coherent gate errors via digital pulse precompilation. Additionally, this method provides whole-chip crosstalk characterization, a useful tool for guiding quantum processor design.</description>

      <title>Improved finite-size effects in QKD protocols with applications to decoy-state QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-size security proof for generic quantum key distribution protocols against independent and identically distributed collective attacks and extend it to coherent attacks using the postselection technique. This work introduces two significant improvements over previous results. First, we achieve tighter finite-size key rates by employing refined concentration inequalities in the acceptance testing phase. Second, we improve second-order correction terms in the key rate expression, by reducing them to scale with the number of sifted rounds rather than the total number of protocol rounds. We apply these advancements to compute finite-size key rates for a qubit and decoy-state BB84 protocol, accommodating arbitrary protocol parameters. Finally, we extend our finite-size security proof to coherent attacks and variable-length protocols and present our results for the decoy-state 4-6 protocol incorporating imperfections such as unequal intensity settings.</description>

      <title>Efficient learning and optimizing non-Gaussian correlated noise in digitally controlled qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise qubit control in the presence of spatio-temporally correlated noise is pivotal for transitioning to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generically, such noise can also have non-Gaussian statistics, which hampers existing non-Markovian noise spectroscopy protocols. By utilizing frame-based characterization and a novel symmetry analysis, we show how to achieve higher-order spectral estimation for noise-optimized circuit design. Remarkably, we find that the digitally driven qubit dynamics can be solely determined by the complexity of the applied control, rather than the non-perturbative nature of the non-Gaussian environment. This enables us to address certain non-perturbative qubit dynamics more simply. We delineate several complexity bounds for learning such high-complexity noise and demonstrate our single and two-qubit digital characterization and control using a series of numerical simulations. Our results not only provide insights into the exact solvability of (small-sized) open quantum dynamics but also highlight a resource-efficient approach for optimal control and possible error reduction techniques for current qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Telegraph flux noise induced beating Ramsey fringe in transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramsey oscillations typically exhibit an exponential decay envelope due to environmental noise. However, recent experiments have observed nonmonotonic Ramsey fringes characterized by beating patterns, which deviate from the standard behavior. These beating patterns have primarily been attributed to charge-noise fluctuations. In this paper, we investigate the flux-noise origin of these nonmonotonic Ramsey fringes in frequency-tunable transmon qubits. We develop a random telegraph noise (RTN) model to simulate the impact of telegraph-like flux-noise sources on Ramsey oscillations. Our simulations demonstrate that strong flux-RTN sources can induce beating patterns in the Ramsey fringes, showing excellent agreement with experimental observations in transmon qubits influenced by electronic environment-induced flux-noise. Our findings provide valuable insights into the role of flux-noise in qubit decoherence and underscore the importance of considering flux-noise RTN when analyzing nonmonotonic Ramsey fringes.</description>

      <title>Exponential Separation Criteria for Quantum Iterative Power Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the vast field of Quantum Optimization, Quantum Iterative Power Algorithms (QIPA) has been introduced recently with a promise of exponential speedup over an already established and well-known method, the variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (varQITE) algorithm. Since the convergence and error of varQITE are known, the promise of QIPA also implied certain collapses in the complexity hierarchy - such as NP $\subseteq$ BQP, as we show in our study. However the original article of QIPA explicitly states the algorithm does not cause any collapses. In this study we prove that these collapses indeed do not occur, and with that, prove that the promised exponential separation is practically unachievable. We do so by introducing criteria for the exponential separation between QIPA that uses a double exponential function and varQITE, and then showing how these criteria require certain properties in problem instances. After that we introduce a preprocessing step that enforces problems to satisfy these criteria, and then we show that the algorithmic error blows up exponentially for these instances, as there is an inverse polynomial term between speedup and the error. Despite the theoretical results, we also show that practically relevant polynomial enhancement is still possible, and show experimental results on a small problem instance, where we used our preprocessing step to achieve the improvement.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Quantum Batteries: Amplified Work Extraction Through Thermal Bath Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the steady state characteristics of work extraction in a two cell and three cell quantum battery interacting with multiple thermal reservoirs. Employing the quantum master equation framework within the Born-Markov approximation, we explore the non equilibrium dynamics governing energy storage and extraction in the system. Our analysis focuses on the influence of thermal gradients across the reservoirs and the impact of inter cell coupling strength on the battery performance. The findings demonstrate that an increase in the middle reservoir temperature substantially enhances the extractable work, underscoring the pivotal role of thermal bath amplification in optimizing energy storage efficiency. Furthermore, we uncover a non trivial relationship between ergotropy and the coupling strength among the quantum cells, revealing the existence of an optimal coupling regime that maximizes energy extraction. Beyond this threshold, excessive coupling induces energy localization, thereby diminishing the system efficiency. These insights provide a theoretical foundation for the strategic design of high performance quantum batteries by harnessing thermal gradients and interaction driven control mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Implementing an information-theoretically secure Byzantine agreement with quantum signed message solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Byzantine agreement (BA) enables all honest nodes in a decentralized network to reach consensus. In the era of emerging quantum technologies, classical cryptography-based BA protocols face inherent security vulnerabilities. By leveraging the information-theoretic security of keys generated by quantum processing, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), and utilizing the one-time pad (OTP) and one-time universal hashing (OTUH) classical methods proposed in \cite{yin2023QDS}, we propose a quantum signed Byzantine agreement (QSBA) protocol based on the quantum signed message (QSM) scheme. This protocol achieves information-theoretic security using only QKD-shared key resources between network nodes, without requiring quantum entanglement or other advanced quantum resources. Compared to the recently proposed quantum Byzantine agreement (QBA) \cite{weng2023beatingQBA}, our QSBA achieves superior fault tolerance, extending the threshold from nearly 1/2 to an arbitrary number of malicious nodes. Furthermore, our QSBA significantly reduces communication complexity under the same number of malicious nodes. Simulation results in a 5-node twin-field QKD network highlight the efficiency of our protocol, showcasing its potential for secure and resource-efficient consensus in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Achievable rates in non-asymptotic bosonic quantum communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum communication has extensively been analysed in the asymptotic setting, assuming infinite channel uses and vanishing communication errors. Comparatively fewer detailed analyses are available in the non-asymptotic setting, which addresses a more precise, quantitative evaluation of the optimal communication rate: how many uses of a bosonic Gaussian channel are required to transmit $k$ qubits, distil $k$ Bell pairs, or generate $k$ secret-key bits, within a given error tolerance $\varepsilon$? In this work, we address this question by finding easily computable lower bounds on the non-asymptotic capacities of Gaussian channels. To derive our results, we develop new tools of independent interest. In particular, we find a stringent bound on the probability $P_{&gt;N}$ that a Gaussian state has more than $N$ photons, demonstrating that $P_{&gt;N}$ decreases exponentially with $N$. Furthermore, we design the first algorithm capable of computing the trace distance between two Gaussian states up to a fixed precision.</description>

      <title>Postselection-Free Cavity-Enhanced Narrow-Band Orbital Angular Momentum Entangled Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) provides a significant way to produce $\sim$10 MHz narrow-band photon pairs, which matches the bandwidth of photon for quantum memory. However, the output photon pairs from the cavity is not entangled and the postselection is required to create the entanglement outside the cavity, so the direct output of cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs is still an open challenge. Here we propose a solution that realizes the first postselection-free cavity-enhanced narrow-band entangled photon pairs. The entanglement is achieved in degree of freedom (DOF) of orbital angular momentum (OAM) by implementing an OAM-conservation SPDC process in an actively and precisely controlled cavity supporting degenerate high-order OAM modes. The measured linewidth for the two photons is 13.8 MHz and the measured fidelity is 0.969(3) for the directly generated OAM entangled two photons. We deterministically transfer the OAM entanglement to polarization one with almost no loss and obtain polarization entangled two photons with a fidelity of 0.948(2). Moreover, we produce narrow-band OAM-polarization hyperentangled photon pairs with a fidelity of 0.850(2) by establishing polarization entanglement with preservation of OAM entanglement, which is realized by interfering the two photons on a polarizing beam splitter (PBS) and post-selecting the events of one and only one photon in on each of the PBS port. Novel cavity may find applications in cavity-based light-matter interaction. Our results provide an efficient and promising approach to create narrow-band entangled photon sources for memory-based long-distance quantum communication and network.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, von Neumann entropy and squeezing in bipartite state of two-level atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a generalized treatment of uncertainties, von Neumann entropy and squeezing in entangled bipartite pure state of two-level atoms. We observe that when the bipartite state is entangled, though the von Neumann entropy of the composite state is less than those of the subsystems, as first recognized by Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger, but the uncertainty of the composite state is greater than those of the subsystems for certain ranges of the superposing constants of the quantum state. This is in contradiction with the prevailing consensus that more is the entropy, more is the uncertainty. Hence, for those ranges of the superposing constants of the quantum state though there is violation of the entropic inequalities, the subsystems exhibit less disorder than the system as a whole. We also provide a generalized relationship between the von Neumann entropy of the subsystems and the uncertainty, spin squeezing and spectroscopic squeezing, used in the context of Ramsey spectroscopy, of the composite state. This gives a generalized operational measure of von Neumann entropy of the entangled subsystems of two-level atoms.</description>

      <title>Classical post-processing approach for quantum amplitude estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach for quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) designed to enhance computational efficiency while minimizing the reliance on quantum resources. Our method leverages quantum computers to generate a sequence of signals, from which the quantum amplitude is inferred through classical post-processing techniques. Unlike traditional methods that use quantum phase estimation (QPE), which requires numerous controlled unitary operations and the quantum Fourier transform, our method avoids these complex and resource-demanding steps. By integrating quantum computing with classical post-processing techniques, our method significantly reduces the need for quantum gates and qubits, thus optimizing the utilization of quantum hardware. We present numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of our method and provide a comprehensive analysis of its computational complexity and error. This hybrid strategy not only improves the practicality of QAE but also broadens its applicability in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several machine learning approaches for predicting the behavior of both classical and quantum systems. For the classical domain, we model a pendulum subject to multiple forces using both a standard artificial neural network (ANN) and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). For the quantum domain, we predict the ground state energy of a quantum anharmonic oscillator from discretized potential data using an ANN with convolutional layers (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a PINN that incorporates the Schr\"odinger equation. Detailed training outputs and comparisons are provided.</description>

      <title>Dynamical complexity of non-Gaussian many-body systems with dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamical state of many-body bosonic and fermionic many-body models with inter-site Gaussian couplings, on-site non-Gaussian interactions and local dissipation comprising incoherent particle loss, particle gain, and dephasing. We first establish that, for fermionic systems, if the dephasing noise is larger than the non-Gaussian interactions, irrespective of the Gaussian coupling strength, the system state is a convex combination of Gaussian states at all times. Furthermore, for bosonic systems, we show that if the particle loss and particle gain rates are larger than the Gaussian inter-site couplings, the system remains in a separable state at all times. Building on this characterization, we establish that at noise rates above a threshold, there exists a classical algorithm that can efficiently sample from the system state of both the fermionic and bosonic models. Finally, we show that, unlike fermionic systems, bosonic systems can evolve into states that are not convex-Gaussian even when the dissipation is much higher than the on-site non-Gaussianity. Similarly, unlike bosonic systems, fermionic systems can generate entanglement even with noise rates much larger than the inter-site couplings.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of entangled states induced by noncommutative deformation of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the notion of quantum entanglement induced by the deformation of phase-space through noncommutative space (NC) parameters. The geometric structure of the state space for Gaussian states in NC-space is illustrated through information geometry approach. We parametrize the phase-space distributions by their covariances and utilize the Fisher-Rao metric to construct the statistical manifold associated with quantum states. We describe the notion of the Robertson-Scr\"{o}dinger uncertainty principle (RSUP) and positive partial transpose (PPT) conditions for allowed quantum states and separable states, respectively, for NC-space. RSUP and PPT provide the restrictions on all allowed states and separable states, respectively. This enables us to estimate the relative volumes of set of separable states and entangled states. Numerical estimations are provided for a toy model of a bipartite Gaussian state. We restrict our study to such bipartite Gaussian states, for which the entanglement is induced by the noncommutative phase-space parameters.</description>

      <title>What Bohmian mechanic says about arrival times of 1D vacuum squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the time of arrival probability distribution of a quantum particle using the Bohmian formalism. The pilot-wave is given by the wave function of the one dimensional vacuum squeezed state but written in the Schr\"odinger representation. We made use of the unitary representation of the symplectic group in the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. The solution to the Bohmian equations are analytical function thus allowing for a closed expression of the time of arrival distribution which differs from the counterparts in the standard quantum mechanics formulation.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Dynamics Yields Anharmonic Rabi Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) approach to the quantum Rabi model, involving a classical optical field coupled self-consistently to a quantum two-level system. Under the rotating wave approximation, we analytically show this approach to yield persistent yet anharmonic Rabi oscillations, governed by an undamped and unforced Duffing equation. We consider the single-quantum limit, where we find such anharmonic Rabi oscillations to closely follow full-quantum results once zero-point energy is approximately enforced when initializing the optical field coordinate. Our findings provide guidance in the application of MQC dynamics to classes of problems involving small quantum numbers and far away from decoherence.</description>

      <title>Detection of Physiological Data Tampering Attacks with Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of cloud-based medical devices and wearable sensors has made physiological data susceptible to tampering. These attacks can compromise the reliability of healthcare systems which can be critical and life-threatening. Detection of such data tampering is of immediate need. Machine learning has been used to detect anomalies in datasets but the performance of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is still yet to be evaluated for physiological sensor data. Thus, our study compares the effectiveness of QML for detecting physiological data tampering, focusing on two types of white-box attacks: data poisoning and adversarial perturbation. The results show that QML models are better at identifying label-flipping attacks, achieving accuracy rates of 75%-95% depending on the data and attack severity. This superior performance is due to the ability of quantum algorithms to handle complex and high-dimensional data. However, both QML and classical models struggle to detect more sophisticated adversarial perturbation attacks, which subtly alter data without changing its statistical properties. Although QML performed poorly against this attack with around 45%-65% accuracy, it still outperformed classical algorithms in some cases.</description>

      <title>Qudit vs. Qubit: Simulated performance of error correction codes in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qudits can be described by a state vector in a q-dimensional Hilbert space, enabling a more extensive encoding and manipulation of information compared to qubits. This implies that conducting fault tolerant quantum computations using qudits rather than qubits might entail less overhead. We test this hypothesis by creating and simulating the quantum circuitry for small qudit error correction codes and specifically adapted decoders and compare the simulated performance with their qubit counterparts under two different noise models. We introduce an error ratio to quantify the trade-off between logical error rates and the reduction in the number of units required when using qudits. We find that the logical error rates of our simulated distance-3 codes would give less average computational errors for the higher dimensional codes, especially when the decoder can be adapted to correct more hyperedge-type errors.</description>

      <title>Perfect Transfer of Entanglement and One-Way Quantum Steering via Parametric Frequency Converter in a Two-mode Cavity Magnomechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of a parametric frequency converter in a two-mode cavity system where one of the cavity mode is coupled with yttrium iron garnet (YIG) via magnetic dipole interaction. Parametric frequency converter acts as a nonlinear source for enhanced entanglement among all bipartitions and asymmetrical quantum steering. The behavior of the two types of quantum correlations are shown to be dependent on parametric coupling and the associated phase factor. We show that cavity-cavity entanglement and cavity-phonon entanglement (cavity-magnon entanglement) decreases (increases) with the increase of the parametric phase factor {\phi}. In addition, generated entanglements in the present system have shown to be more robust against the thermal effects, with the inclusion of the parametric converter as compared with the bare cavity case. Another intriguing finding is the asymmetric one-way steering, where we notice that magnon and phonon modes can steer the indirectly coupled cavity modes, yet the steering in swapped direction is not observed. It is of great interest that the perfect transfer of entanglement and quantum steering is achieved among different modes by adjusting the system's parameters. In fact, our protocol for these transferring processes suggests a different approach to the processing and storage of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Compressed sensing enabled high-bandwidth and large dynamic range magnetic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) is a widely common method in the field of quantum sensing. Specifically with the Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond, used for sensing magnetic and electric fields, strain and temperature. However, ESR measurements are limited in temporal resolution, primarily due to the large number of data points required especially in high dynamic range regimes and the need for extensive averaging caused by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study introduces a novel application of compressed sensing (CS) for magnetic sensing using NV centers. By comparing CS with conventional raster scanning, we demonstrate the potential of CS to enhance sensing applications. Experimental results, supported by simulations, show an improvement of factor 3 in measurement accuracy in low SNR data, which also translates to achieving the same accuracy with only 15% of the data points. Moreover, the proposed approach is not confined to NV centers but can be extended to ESR measurements in other systems, broadening its applicability in quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A triangular graphenic billiard is defined as a planar carbon polymer in the H\"uckeloid approximation of $\pi-$band electrons. It is shown that the equilateral triangle of arbitrary size and zig-zag edges allows for exact solutions of the associated spectral problem. This is done by a construction of wave superpositions similar to the Lam\'e solution of the Helmholtz equation in a triangular cavity, revisited by Pinsky. Exact wave functions, eigenvalues, degeneracies, and edge states are provided. The edge states are also obtained by a non-periodic construction of waves with vanishing energy. A comment on its connection with recent molecular models, such as triangulene, is given.</description>

      <title>Exact solvability of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for bound states subjected to general potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the analytic solution to the problem of bound states of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation in 1D and its properties, in the presence of external potentials in the form of finite square wells or attractive Dirac deltas, as well as stable solitons for repulsive defects. We show that the GP equation can be mapped to a first-order non-autonomous dynamical system, whose solutions can sometimes be written in terms of known functions. The formal solutions of this non-conservative system can be written with the help of Glauber-Trotter formulas or a series of ordered exponentials in the coordinate $x$. With this we illustrate how to solve any nonlinear problem based on a construction due to Mello and Kumar for the linear case (layered potentials). For the benefit of the reader, we comment on the difference between the integrability of a quantum system and the solvability of the wave equation.</description>

Abstract: In stabilizer-based quantum secret sharing schemes, it is known that some shares can be distributed to participants before a secret is given to the dealer. This distribution is known as advance sharing. It is already known that a set of shares is advance shareable only if it is a forbidden set. However, it was not known whether any forbidden set is advance shareable. We provide an example of a set of shares such that it is a forbidden set but is not advance shareable in the previous scheme. Furthermore, we propose a quantum secret sharing scheme for quantum secrets such that any forbidden set is advance shareable.</description>

      <title>Conditioning through indifference in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We can learn (more) about the state a quantum system is in through measurements. We look at how to describe the uncertainty about a quantum system's state conditional on executing such measurements. We show that by exploiting the interplay between desirability, coherence and indifference, a general rule for conditioning can be derived. We then apply this rule to conditioning on measurement outcomes, and show how it generalises to conditioning on a set of measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Compilation Techniques for Spin Qubits in a Shuttling Bus Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore and propose several quantum circuit mapping strategies to optimize qubit shuttling in scalable quantum computing architectures based on silicon spin qubits. Our goal is to minimize phase errors introduced during shuttling operations while reducing the overall execution time of quantum circuits. We propose and evaluate five mapping algorithms using benchmarks from quantum algorithms. The Swap Return strategy emerged as the most robust solution, offering a superior balance between execution time and error minimization by considering future qubit interactions. Additionally, we assess the importance of initial qubit placement, demonstrating that an informed placement strategy can significantly enhance the performance of dynamic mapping approaches.</description>

      <title>Application of quantum machine learning using quantum kernel algorithms on multiclass neuron M type classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional characterization of different neuronal types has been a longstanding and crucial challenge. With the advent of physical quantum computers, it has become possible to apply quantum machine learning algorithms to translate theoretical research into practical solutions. Previous studies have shown the advantages of quantum algorithms on artificially generated datasets, and initial experiments with small binary classification problems have yielded comparable outcomes to classical algorithms. However, it is essential to investigate the potential quantum advantage using real-world data. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose the utilization of quantum systems to classify neuron morphologies, thereby enhancing our understanding of the performance of automatic multiclass neuron classification using quantum kernel methods. We examined the influence of feature engineering on classification accuracy and found that quantum kernel methods achieved similar performance to classical methods, with certain advantages observed in various configurations.</description>

      <title>Exact collective occupancies of the Moshinsky model in two-dimensional geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the ground state of $N$ bosonic atoms confined in a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic trap, where the atoms interact via a harmonic potential. We derive an exact diagonal representation of the first-order reduced density matrix in polar coordinates, in which the angular components of the natural orbitals are eigenstates of the angular momentum operator. Furthermore, we present an exact expression for the collective occupancy of the natural orbitals with angular momentum $l$, quantifying the fraction of particles carrying that angular momentum. The present study explores how the dependence of collective occupancy relies on angular momentum $l$ and the control parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we examine boson fragmentation into components with different $l$ and reveal a unique feature of the system: the natural orbitals contributing to the correlations are uniformly distributed across all significant $l$ components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analog classical simulation algorithm of noiseless quantum dynamics. By formulating the Schr\"{o}dinger equation into a linear system of real-valued ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the probability amplitudes of a complex state vector can be encoded in the continuous physical variables of an analog computer. Our algorithm reveals the full dynamics of complex probability amplitudes. Such real-time simulation is impossible in quantum simulation approaches without collapsing the state vector, and it is relatively computationally expensive for digital classical computers. For a real symmetric time-independent Hamiltonian, the ODEs may be solved by a simple analog mechanical device such as a one-dimensional spring-mass system. Since the underlying dynamics of quantum computers is governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, our findings imply that analog computers can also perform quantum algorithms. We illustrate how to simulate the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in such a paradigm, with an application to quantum approximate optimization algorithm. This may pave the way to emulate quantum algorithms with physical computing devices, including analog, continuous-time circuits.</description>

      <title>Tailoring indistinguishability of photons using longitudinal spatial coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods to generate photons with tailored indistinguishability are central to developing photonic quantum technologies and making fundamental tests of quantum physics. This study introduces a novel method for manipulating effective longitudinal spatial coherence (LSC) of biphotons, controlling their indistinguishability in a significant manner. The experimental results show that, instead of tailoring the frequency spectrum of the interfering photons, changing their LSC also leads to controlling the width of Hong-Ou-Mandel dip as validated by the theoretical calculations. This powerful approach not only modifies the conventional wisdom claiming only frequency width responsible for indistinguishability control of photons but also positions the LSC as a promising tool for fine-tuning the longitudinal coherence of photons, thereby expanding their potential use in quantum science and technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Based Design of Multivariate Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate (MTV) porous materials exhibit unique structural complexities based on their diverse spatial arrangements of multiple building block combinations. These materials possess potential synergistic functionalities that exceed the sum of their individual components. However, the exponentially increasing design complexity of these materials poses significant challenges for accurate ground-state configuration prediction and design. To address this, we propose a Hamiltonian model for quantum computing that integrates compositional, structural, and balance constraints directly into the Hamiltonian, enabling efficient optimization of the MTV configurations. The model employs a graph-based representation to encode linker types as qubits. Our framework leads to exponentially efficient exploration of a vast search space of the linkers to identify optimal configurations based on predefined design variables. To validate our model, a variational quantum circuit was constructed and executed using the Sampling VQE algorithm in the IBM Qiskit. Simulations on experimentally known MTV porous materials (e.g. Cu-THQ-HHTP, Py-MVDBA-COF, MUF-7, and SIOC-COF2) successfully reproduced their ground-state configurations, demonstrating the validity of our model.</description>

      <title>Protecting Heralded Single Photons Generated from Double-$\Lambda$ Biphoton Sources with Doppler-Broadened Atomic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphoton sources that use room-temperature or hot atoms are valuable for real-world applications in long-distance quantum communication and photonic quantum computation. The heralded single photons produced by biphoton sources using the double-$\Lambda$ spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process offer advantages of narrow linewidth, stable frequency, and tunable linewidth -- qualities not found in other types of biphoton sources. In this study, we investigated a hot-atom SFWM double-$\Lambda$ biphoton source. We discovered that, under the condition counterintuitive to the present theory, heralded single photons of the source enhanced their generation rate by a factor of 3.6, heralding probability by a factor of 3.0, temporal width by 2.1, and spectral brightness by a factor of 10. These unexpected findings led us to propose a new theoretical framework for a previously unexplored physical mechanism. Our proposed theory effectively explains the observed results. Traditionally, similar spectral brightness (SB) from atom-based sources resulted in a lower signal-to-background ratio (SBR) than crystal- or chip-based biphoton sources, mainly due to poorer heralding probabilities. In our work, we experimentally demonstrated that the SBR improved by a factor of 4.8 while maintaining a comparable SB. As a result, the SBR performance of the atom-based biphoton source is now on par with that of crystal- or chip-based sources. This research introduces a new tuning parameter for double-$\Lambda$ SFWM biphoton sources, enhances our understanding of biphoton generation, and opens new avenues for improving the performance of these sources.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Local Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are fundamental resources that characterize distinct aspects of a quantum state: entanglement reflects non-local correlations, while magic quantifies the deviation from stabilizer states. A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum non-local magic (NM) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and magic. We demonstrate that NM can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, where it is directly related to the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NM to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems, revealing that the two-point NM decays according to a power law in critical states. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NM and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed "magic swapping", analogous to entanglement swapping, wherein post-measurement NM decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. Our results thus represent a pivotal step towards accurately quantifying the "quantumness" of a state and reveal the potential for manipulating this resource through measurements.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Convergent Algorithm for Computing the Petz-Augustin Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an iterative algorithm for computing the Petz-Augustin information of order $\alpha\in(1/2,1)\cup(1,\infty)$. The optimization error is guaranteed to converge at a rate of $O\left(\vert 1-1/\alpha \vert^T\right)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Let $n$ denote the cardinality of the input alphabet of the classical-quantum channel, and $d$ the dimension of the quantum states. The algorithm has an initialization time complexity of $O\left(n d^{3}\right)$ and a per-iteration time complexity of $O\left(n d^{2}+d^3\right)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for computing the Petz-Augustin information with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee.</description>

Abstract: We improve on the results of [A. Jackson et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 121 (6). 2024] on the verification of analogue quantum simulators by eliminating the use of universal Hamiltonians, removing the need for two-qubit gates, and no longer assuming error is represented by identical maps across simulations. This new protocol better reflects the reality of extant analogue simulators. It integrates well with recent complexity theoretic results, leading to a near-term feasible simulation-based route to establishing quantum advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to realize arbitrary state synthesis and unitary operations on a qudit encoded in the dressed states of a Rydberg blockaded array of three-level atoms. This system is in isomorphism with the Jaynes-Cummings model and acts as an artificial molecule where we can precisely control the structure of the energy levels through the parameters of the laser driving the upper transition. Control of the qudit state is possible through pulse sequences of the laser driving the lower transition. We estimate the fidelity of our protocol for realizing arbitrary unitaries and discuss the influence of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg state. Our work paves the way to process quantum information with Rydbgerg blockaded arrays of atoms as an alternative to atom qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the performance of quantum process units at large width and depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, we are in a stage where quantum computers surpass the size that can be simulated exactly on classical computers, and noise is the central issue in extracting their full potential. Effective ways to characterize and measure their progress for practical applications are needed. In this work, we use the linear ramp quantum approximate optimization algorithm (LR-QAOA) protocol, a fixed quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) protocol, as an easy-to-implement scalable benchmarking methodology that assesses quantum process units (QPUs) at different widths (number of qubits) and 2-qubit gate depths. The benchmarking identifies the depth at which a fully mixed state is reached, and therefore, the results cannot be distinguished from those of a random sampler. We test this methodology using three graph topologies: 1D-chain, native layout, and fully connected graphs, on 19 different QPUs from 5 vendors: IBM, IQM, IonQ, Quantinuum, and Rigetti for problem sizes requiring from Nq=5 to Nq=156 qubits and LR-QAOA number of layers from p=3 to p=10,000. In the case of 1D-chain and native graphs, ibm_fez, the system with the largest number of qubits, performs best at p=15 for problems involving Nq=100 and Nq=156 qubits and 1,485 and 2,640 2-qubit gates, respectively. For the native graph problem, ibm_fez still retains some coherent information at p=200 involving 35,200 fractional 2-qubit gates. Our largest implementation is a 1D-chain problem with p=10,000 involving 990,000 2-qubit gates on ibm_fez. For fully connected graph problems, quantinuum_H2-1 shows the best performance, passing the test with Nq=56 qubits at p=3 involving 4,620 2-qubit gates with the largest 2-qubit gate implementation for a problem with Nq=50 qubits and p=10 involving 12,250 2-qubit gates but not passing the test.</description>

      <title>Charging a Dimerized Quantum XY Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are quantum systems designed to store energy and release it on demand. The optimization of their performance is an intensively studied topic within the realm of quantum technologies. Such optimization forces the question: how do quantum many-body systems work as quantum batteries? To address this issue, we rely on symmetry and symmetry breaking via quantum phase transitions. Specifically, we analyze a dimerized quantum XY chain in a transverse field as a prototype of an energy storage device. This model, which is characterized by ground states with different symmetries depending on the Hamiltonian parameters, can be mapped onto a spinless fermionic chain with superconducting correlations, displaying a rich quantum phase diagram. We show that the stored energy strongly depends on the quantum phase diagram of the model when large charging times are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a recurrent neural network-based approach for ground state preparation utilizing mid-circuit measurement and feedback. Unlike previous methods that use machine learning solely as an optimizer, our approach dynamically adjusts quantum circuits based on real-time measurement outcomes and learns distinct preparation protocols for different Hamiltonians. Notably, our machine learning algorithm consistently identifies a state preparation strategy wherein all initial states are first steered toward an intermediate state before transitioning to the target ground state. We demonstrate that performance systematically improves as a larger fraction of ancilla qubits are utilized for measurement and feedback, highlighting the efficacy of mid-circuit measurements in state preparation tasks.</description>

This refinement yields tighter achievability bounds for quantum source coding tasks, including state merging and state splitting. Furthermore, we derive a universal upper bound on the smoothed max mutual information, where "universal" signifies that the bound depends exclusively on R\'enyi entropies and is independent of the system's dimensions. This result has significant implications for quantum information processing, particularly in applications such as the reverse quantum Shannon theorem.</description>

      <title>On the utility of the switching theorem for adiabatic state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viability of adiabatic quantum computation depends on the slow evolution of the Hamiltonian. The adiabatic switching theorem provides an asymptotic series for error estimates in $1/T$, based on the lowest non-zero derivative of the Hamiltonian and its eigenvalues at the endpoints. Modifications at the endpoints in practical implementations can modify this scaling behavior, suggesting opportunities for error reduction by altering endpoint behavior while keeping intermediate evolution largely unchanged. Such modifications can significantly reduce errors for long evolution times, but they may also require exceedingly long timescales to reach the hyperadiabatic regime, limiting their practicality. This paper explores the transition between the adiabatic and hyperadiabatic regimes in simple low-dimensional Hamiltonians, highlighting the impact of modifications of the endpoints on approaching the asymptotic behavior described by the switching theorem.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulations of centroid-based clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in data science that aims to group data based on their similarities. However, defining similarity is often ambiguous, making it challenging to determine the most appropriate objective function for a given dataset. Traditional clustering methods, such as the $k$-means algorithm and weighted maximum $k$-cut, focus on specific objectives -- typically relying on average or pairwise characteristics of the data -- leading to performance that is highly data-dependent. Moreover, incorporating practical constraints into clustering objectives is not straightforward, and these problems are known to be NP-hard. In this study, we formulate the clustering problem as a search for the ground state of a Hamiltonian, providing greater flexibility in defining clustering objectives and incorporating constraints. This approach enables the application of various quantum simulation techniques, including both circuit-based quantum computation and quantum annealing, thereby opening a path toward quantum advantage in solving clustering problems. We propose various Hamiltonians to accommodate different clustering objectives, including the ability to combine multiple objectives and incorporate constraints. We evaluate the clustering performance through numerical simulations and implementations on the D-Wave quantum annealer. The results demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach to a variety of clustering problems on current quantum devices. Furthermore, we find that Hamiltonians designed for specific clustering objectives and constraints impose different requirements for qubit connectivity, indicating that certain clustering tasks are better suited to specific quantum hardware. Our experimental results highlight this by identifying the Hamiltonian that optimally utilizes the physical qubits available in the D-Wave System.</description>

      <title>Deciding Local Unitary Equivalence of Graph States in Quasi-Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an algorithm with quasi-polynomial runtime $n^{\log_2(n)+O(1)}$ for deciding local unitary (LU) equivalence of graph states. The algorithm builds on a recent graphical characterisation of LU-equivalence via generalised local complementation. By first transforming the corresponding graphs into a standard form using usual local complementations, LU-equivalence reduces to the existence of a single generalised local complementation that maps one graph to the other. We crucially demonstrate that this reduces to solving a system of quasi-polynomially many linear equations, avoiding an exponential blow-up. As a byproduct, we generalise Bouchet's algorithm for deciding local Clifford (LC) equivalence of graph states by allowing the addition of arbitrary linear constraints. We also improve existing bounds on the size of graph states that are LU- but not LC-equivalent. While the smallest known examples involve 27 qubits, and it is established that no such examples exist for up to 8 qubits, we refine this bound by proving that LU- and LC-equivalence coincide for graph states involving up to 19 qubits.</description>

      <title>How to Entangle or Disentangle Gaussian States with Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interference of two indistinguishable photons from a photon pair on a balanced beam splitter, where each photon enters in one of the input ports, yields a maximally entangled N00N-state shared between the outputs of the beam splitter through Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. At the same time, interference between the two modes of a two-mode squeezed state - the generalized output of a parametric photon-pair source - yields two independent, hence separable, single-mode squeezed states. Notably, both experiments use the exact same experimental setup. We resolve this seeming contradiction by measuring photon-number resolved quantum interference of the two modes of a two-mode squeezed state from an engineered parametric down-conversion source and show that the notion of inseparability is a result of post-selection on the presence of photons. Indeed, the complete joint photon statistics including the vacuum component are separable, as expected from textbook calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable solid-state quantum computers will require integration with analog and digital electronics. Efficiently simulating the quantum-classical electronic interface is hence of paramount importance. Here, we present Verilog-A compact models with a focus on quantum-dot-based systems, relevant to semiconductor- and Majorana-based quantum computing. Our models are capable of faithfully reproducing coherent quantum behavior within a standard electronic circuit simulator, enabling compromise-free co-simulation of hybrid quantum devices. In particular, we present results from co-simulations performed in Cadence Spectre, showcasing coherent quantum phenomena in circuits with both quantum and classical components using an industry-standard electronic design and automation tool. Our work paves the way for a new paradigm in the design of quantum systems, which leverages the many decades of development of electronic computer-aided design and automation tools in the semiconductor industry to now simulate and optimize quantum processing units, quantum-classical interfaces, and hybrid quantum-analog circuits.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited calibration of entangling gates with robust phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of high-quality two-qubit entangling gates is an essential component in engineering large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, many standard calibration techniques are based on randomized circuits that are only quadratically sensitive to calibration errors. As a result, these approaches are inefficient, requiring many experimental shots to achieve acceptable performance. In this work, we demonstrate that robust phase estimation can enable high-precision, Heisenberg-limited estimates of coherent errors in multi-qubit gates. Equipped with an efficient estimator, the calibration problem may be reduced to a simple optimization loop that minimizes the estimated coherent error. We experimentally demonstrate our calibration protocols by improving the operation of a two-qubit controlled-Z gate on a superconducting processor, and we validate the improved performance with gate set tomography. Our methods are applicable to gates in other quantum hardware platforms such as ion traps and neutral atoms, and on other multi-qubit gates, such as CNOT or iSWAP.</description>

      <title>A Review and Collection of Metrics and Benchmarks for Quantum Computers: definitions, methodologies and software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to provide an advantage over classical computers in a number of areas. Numerous metrics to benchmark the performance of quantum computers, ranging from their individual hardware components to entire applications, have been proposed over the years. Navigating the resulting extensive literature can be overwhelming. Objective comparisons are further hampered in practice as different variations of the same metric are used, and the data disclosed together with a reported metric value is often not sufficient to reproduce the measurements. This article addresses these challenges by providing a review of metrics and benchmarks for quantum computers and 1) a comprehensive collection of benchmarks allowing holistic comparisons of quantum computers, 2) a consistent format of the definitions across all metrics including a transparent description of the methodology and of the main assumptions and limitations, and 3) a reproducible approach by linking the metrics to open-source software used to evaluate them.
  We identify five areas where international standardization working groups could be established, namely: i) the identification and agreement on the categories of metrics that comprehensively benchmark device performance; ii) the identification and agreement on a set of well-established metrics that together comprehensively benchmark performance; iii) the identification of metrics specific to hardware platforms, including non-gate-based quantum computers; iv) inter-laboratory comparison studies to develop best practice guides for measurement methodology; and v) agreement on what data and software should be reported together with a metric value to ensure trust, transparency and reproducibility. We provide potential routes to advancing these areas. We expect this compendium to accelerate the progress of quantum computing hardware towards quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Exact NESS of XXZ circuits boundary driven with arbitrary resets or fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose spatially inhomogeneous matrix product ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary driven XXZ quantum circuit. The ansatz has formally infinite bond-dimension and is fundamentally different from previous constructions. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Moreover, one of the reset channels can be replaced by an arbitrary local unitary gate, thus representing a hybrid case with coherent/incoherent driving. Analyzing the ansatz we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states, and are particularly suited for experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Fat-Tree QRAM: A High-Bandwidth Shared Quantum Random Access Memory for Parallel Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) is a crucial architectural component for querying classical or quantum data in superposition, enabling algorithms with wide-ranging applications in quantum arithmetic, quantum chemistry, machine learning, and quantum cryptography. In this work, we introduce Fat-Tree QRAM, a novel query architecture capable of pipelining multiple quantum queries simultaneously while maintaining desirable scalings in query speed and fidelity. Specifically, Fat-Tree QRAM performs $O(\log (N))$ independent queries in $O(\log (N))$ time using $O(N)$ qubits, offering immense parallelism benefits over traditional QRAM architectures. To demonstrate its experimental feasibility, we propose modular and on-chip implementations of Fat-Tree QRAM based on superconducting circuits and analyze their performance and fidelity under realistic parameters. Furthermore, a query scheduling protocol is presented to maximize hardware utilization and access the underlying data at an optimal rate. These results suggest that Fat-Tree QRAM is an attractive architecture in a shared memory system for practical quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables secure key sharing between distant parties, with several protocols proven resilient against conventional eavesdropping strategies. Here, we introduce a new attack scenario where an eavesdropper, Eve, exploits a quantum switch using the indefinite causal order to intercept and manipulate quantum communication channel. Using multiple metrics such as the information gain, mutual information, and Bell violation, we demonstrate that the presence of a quantum switch significantly compromises QKD security. Our results highlight a previously overlooked vulnerability, emphasizing the need for countermeasures against quantum-controlled adversarial strategies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations in classical and quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to derive exact cumulant expressions of any order of von Neumann entropy over Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble. The new method uncovers hidden cumulant structures that decouple each cumulant in a summation-free manner into its lower-order joint cumulants involving families of ancillary statistics. Importantly, the new method is able to avoid the seemingly inevitable task of simplifying nested summations of increasing difficulty that prevents the existing method in the literature to obtain higher-order cumulants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental demonstration of a recently predicted path interference phenomenon [Nanophotonics 7, 1687 (2018)]. A SERS process becomes resonant when both incident and the converted frequencies match with two plasmon resonances -- a condition which is hard to satisfy experimentally. Yet, presence of a quantum dot~(QD) coupled to the lower-energy plasmon mode has been predicted to introduce interference effect in the conversion paths and to bring the SERS process into resonance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a 7-fold additional enhancement factor~(EF) {\it multiplying} the conventional SERS enhancement owing to the presence of QDs in addition to metal nanoparticles~(MNPs). We eliminate influence of alternative enhancement mechanisms and show that observed additional EF of 7 is solely because of the path interference~(Fano) effect taking place in the presence of the QDs. As the most significant evidence: we observe that when QD/MNP ratio exceeds $1$, EF starts to decrease. Two or more QDs sitting at different~(random) positions on a nanostar MNP surface starts to degrade the path interference effect. Even though the theoretically predicted maximum EFs of $\sim$100--1000 when QD is in the MNP hotspot are not always experimentally feasible in stochastic nature of large area SERS substrate, still, observation of a 7-fold overall increase in such a setting is significant for fabricating Raman-based sensor applications. More importantly, our scheme allows for designing selective SERS substrates. As the QD resonances can actively be shifted by external factors, such as by applying an electric field (Stark effect), it provides a previously-not-existing tool: active selective enhancement of Raman bands via an applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable multicomponent spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By generalising the one to one correspondence between exactly solvable hermitian matrices $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}^\dagger$ and exactly solvable spinless fermion systems $\mathcal{H}_f=\sum_{x,y}c_x^\dagger\mathcal{H}(x,y)c_y$, four types of exactly solvable multicomponent fermion systems are constructed explicitly. They are related to the multivariate Krawtcouk, Meixner and two types of Rahman like polynomials, constructed recently by myself. The Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are the eigenvectors of certain real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ which are related to the difference equations governing them. The corresponding fermions have nearest neighbour interactions. The Rahman like polynomials are eigenvectors of certain reversible Markov chain matrices $\mathcal{K}$, from which real symmetric matrices $\mathcal{H}$ are uniquely defined by the similarity transformation in terms of the square root of the stationary distribution. The fermions have wide range interactions.</description>

      <title>Stark Shift from Quantum Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information applications, owing to their efficient and bright single photon emission. Despite the challenges in directly characterizing these emitters, the interaction between external fields and defects, such as the Stark shift, offers valuable insights into their local geometric configurations. In this study, we focus on clarifying the possible origin of the distinct Stark shift characteristics observed experimentally, particularly in the emission range around 2 eV. We find that the local symmetry of the defects plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the Stark shift, which can be either linear or quadratic. Additionally, the local dielectric environment significantly influences the Stark shift response. Our calculations not only enhance the understanding of the micro-structure of these hitherto unknown emitters but also pave the way for their more effective utilization as single-photon sources and qubits in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Operator convexity along lines, self-concordance, and sandwiched R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barrier methods play a central role in the theory and practice of convex optimization. One of the most general and successful analyses of barrier methods for convex optimization, due to Nesterov and Nemirovskii, relies on the notion of self-concordance. While an extremely powerful concept, proving self-concordance of barrier functions can be very difficult. In this paper we give a simple way to verify that the natural logarithmic barrier of a convex nonlinear constraint is self-concordant via the theory of operator convex functions. Namely, we show that if a convex function is operator convex along any one-dimensional restriction, then the natural logarithmic barrier of its epigraph is self-concordant. We apply this technique to construct self-concordant barriers for the epigraphs of functions arising in quantum information theory. Notably, we apply this to the sandwiched R\'enyi entropy function, for which no self-concordant barrier was known before. Additionally, we utilize our sufficient condition to provide simplified proofs for previously established self-concordance results for the noncommutative perspective of operator convex functions. An implementation of the convex cones considered in this paper is now available in our open source interior-point solver QICS.</description>

      <title>Paradox No More: How Stimulated Emission of Radiation Preserves Information Absorbed by Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes have been implicated in two paradoxes that involve apparently non-unitary dynamics. According to Hawking's theory, information that is absorbed by a black hole is destroyed, and the originally pure state of a black hole is converted to a mixed state upon complete evaporation. Here we address one of the two, namely the apparent loss of (classical) information when it crosses the event horizon. We show that this paradox is due to a mistake in Hawking's original derivation: he ignored the contribution of the stimulated emission of radiation that according to Einstein's theory of blackbody radiance must accompany the spontaneous emission (the Hawking radiation). Resurrecting the contribution of stimulated emission makes it possible to calculate the (positive) classical information transmission capacity of black holes, which implies that information is fully recoverable from the radiation outside the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Engineered Chirality of One-Dimensional Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin and function of chirality in DNA, proteins, and other building blocks of life represent a central question in biology. Observations of spin polarization and magnetization associated with electron transport through chiral molecules, known collectively as the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, suggest that chirality improves electron transfer by inhibiting backscattering. Meanwhile, the role of coherence in the electron transport within chiral nanowires is believed to be important but is challenging to investigate experimentally. Using reconfigurable nanoscale control over conductivity at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we create chiral electron potentials that explicitly lack mirror symmetry. Quantum transport measurements on these chiral regions that constitute effective nanowires for the electrons reveal oscillatory transmission resonances as a function of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region. The ability to create 1D effective electron waveguides with this specificity and complexity creates new opportunities to test, via analog quantum simulation, theories about the relationship between chirality and spin-polarized electron transport in one-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new category of simplicial effects that extends the categories of effect algebras and their multi-object counterpart, effect algebroids. Our approach is based on relaxing the associativity condition satisfied by effect algebras and, more generally, partial monoids. Within this framework, simplicial effects and weakly associative partial groups arise as two extreme cases in the category of weak partial monoids. Our motivation is to capture simplicial structures from the theory of simplicial distributions and measurements that behave like effects.</description>

      <title>Explicit Solution Equation for Every Combinatorial Problem via Tensor Networks: MeLoCoToN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that every combinatorial problem has an exact explicit equation that returns its solution. We present a method to obtain an equation that solves exactly any combinatorial problem, both inversion, constraint satisfaction and optimization, by obtaining its equivalent tensor network. This formulation only requires a basic knowledge of classical logical operators, at a first year level of any computer science degree. These equations are not necessarily computable in a reasonable time, nor do they allow to surpass the state of the art in computational complexity, but they allow to have a new perspective for the mathematical analysis of these problems. These equations computation can be approximated by different methods such as Matrix Product State compression. We also present the equations for numerous combinatorial problems. This work proves that, if there is a physical system capable of contracting in polynomial time the tensor networks presented, every NP-Hard problem can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: We show how the AGM framework for belief change (expansion, revision, contraction) can be extended to deal with conditioning in the so-called Desirability-Indifference framework, based on abstract notions of accepting and rejecting options, as well as on abstract notions of events. This level of abstraction allows us to deal simultaneously with classical and quantum probability theory.</description>

      <title>Observation of Coherent Quantum Tunneling of a Massive Atomic Cluster with 435 u</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunneling is a genuine quantum phenomenon typically observed in low-mass particles such as electrons. However, it fades rapidly as mass increases due to the exponential decay of the matter-wave penetration depth. Cooling atoms to nanokelvin temperatures enhances their matter wave characteristics. Here, we report the observation of coherent quantum tunneling of a bonded cluster composed of 5 ultracold rubidium-87 atoms, collectively forming a massive object of 435 u. Using a double-well superlattice, integer occupancy states are prepared, with atoms bonded via strong on-site interactions. We demonstrate that the exponential base of tunneling strength can be tuned to approach unity, drastically reducing its decay for heavier masses and enabling a scalable strategy. Moreover, tunneling is harnessed to create spatially separated Schr\"{o}dinger-cat states (~320 nm apart), achieving quantum enhancement in measurements. This work markedly raises the mass threshold for quantum tunneling and paves the way for quantum metrology with massive particles.</description>

      <title>The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</description>

Abstract: We show that the momentum, the density, and the electromagnetic field associated with the massive KleinGordon-Maxwell equations converge in the semi-classical limit towards their respective equivalents associated with the relativistic Euler-Maxwell equations. The proof relies on a modulated stress-energy method and a compactness argument. We also give a proof of the well-posedness of the relativistic Euler-Maxwell equations and show how this system, and so the semi-classical limit of Klein-Gordon-Maxwell, is related to the relativistic massive Vlasov-Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Magnon-Polarons in the Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum compilation algorithm that maps Clifford encoders, encoding maps for stabilizer quantum codes, to a unique graphical representation in the ZX calculus. Specifically, we develop a canonical form in the ZX calculus and prove canonicity as well as efficient reducibility of any Clifford encoder into the canonical form. The diagrams produced by our compiler visualize information propagation and entanglement structure of the encoder, revealing properties that may be obscured in the circuit or stabilizer-tableau representation. Consequently, our canonical representation may be an informative technique for the design of new stabilizer quantum codes via graph theory analysis.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed efficient energy estimation of quantum many-body Hamiltonians using ShadowGrouping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation of the energy of quantum many-body systems is a paradigmatic task in various research fields. In particular, efficient energy estimation may be crucial in achieving a quantum advantage for a practically relevant problem. For instance, the measurement effort poses a critical bottleneck for variational quantum algorithms.
  We aim to find the optimal strategy with single-qubit measurements that yields the highest provable accuracy given a total measurement budget. As a central tool, we establish new tail bounds for empirical estimators of the energy. They are helpful for identifying measurement settings that improve the energy estimate the most. This task constitutes an NP-hard problem. However, we are able to circumvent this bottleneck and use the tail bounds to develop a practical, efficient estimation strategy, which we call ShadowGrouping. As the name indicates, it combines shadow estimation methods with grouping strategies for Pauli strings. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate that ShadowGrouping improves upon state-of-the-art methods in estimating the electronic ground-state energies of various small molecules, both in provable and practical accuracy benchmarks. Hence, this work provides a promising way, e.g., to tackle the measurement bottleneck associated with quantum many-body Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: The discretization approximation method in real configuration commonly used to simulate the open dynamics of system coupled to the environment in continuum often suffers from the recurrence. To address this issue, we paper proposes a novel generalization of the discretization approximation method into the complex plane using complex Gauss quadratures. An effective Hamiltonian can be established by this way, which is non-Hermitian and demonstrates the complex energy modes with negative imaginary part, describing accurately the dissipative dynamics of the system. This method is applied to examine the dynamics in two exactly solvable models, the dephasing model and the single-excitation open dynamics in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model. By comparison with the exact numerics and analytical results, it is found that our approach not only significantly reduces recurrence and improve the effectiveness of calculation, but also provide a unique perspective into the dynamics of system based on the complex eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. Furthermore, by analyzing the computational error, we establish a simple relationship between the parameters in computation and the effectiveness of simulation.</description>

      <title>Probing spectral features of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Wigner representations for general probabilistic theories (GPTs), a large class of operational theories that include both classical and quantum theory. The Wigner representations that we introduce are a natural way to describe the theory in terms of some fixed observables; these observables are often picked to be position and momentum or spin observables. This allows us to introduce symmetries which transform the outcomes of the observables used to construct the Wigner representation; we obtain several results for when these symmetries are well defined or when they uniquely specify the Wigner representation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Two-Way Protocol Beyond Superdense Coding: Joint Transfer of Data and Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a generalization of one-way superdense coding to two-way communication protocols for transmitting classical bits by using entangled quantum pairs. The proposed protocol jointly addresses the provision of entangled pairs and superdense coding, introducing an integrated approach for managing entanglement within the communication protocol. To assess the performance of the proposed protocol, we consider its data rate and resource usage, and we analyze this both in an ideal setting with no decoherence and in a more realistic setting where decoherence must be taken into account. In the ideal case, the proposal offers a 50% increase in both data rate and resource usage efficiency compared to conventional protocols. Even when decoherence is taken into consideration, the quantum protocol performs better as long as the decoherence time is not extremely short. Finally, we present the results of implementing the protocol in a computer simulation based on the NetSquid framework. We compare the simulation results with the theoretical values.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity mediated miscibility dynamics of mass-imbalanced binary Bose Einstein condensate for circular atomtronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the nonlinearity-induced and fractional revivals-driven miscibility dynamics of quasi-2D mass-imbalanced binary Bose-Einstein condensates, confined in a ring-shaped waveguide. During their time-evolution, the two condensate species generally remain miscible, as observed in the spatial density distributions and the autocorrelation functions. Although, the investigation is carried out for a wide range of mass-imbalance, initial demonstration is focussed on insignificant mass-imbalance of the two Rb-isotopes with suitable experimental parameters. The characteristic time scales are influenced by the trap parameters and the strengths of nonlinearities. The study also reveals the conditions under which the condensates become spatially distinguishable with clear signatures in their autocorrelation functions. A separability function further identifies favorable parameters and the fractional revival instances for greater separability. We report precise range of the ring-radius and the interaction strength for experimental realization. Additionally, the average separability variation reflects the result across a variety of condensate species.</description>

      <title>Approaching maximal precision of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with non-perfect visibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, the precision achieved in parameter estimation using a quantum state as a probe is determined by the measurement strategy employed. The ultimate quantum limit of precision is bounded by a value set by the state and its dynamics. Theoretical results have revealed that in interference measurements with two possible outcomes, this limit can be reached under ideal conditions of perfect visibility and zero losses. However, in practice, this cannot be achieved, so precision {\it never} reaches the quantum limit. But how do experimental setups approach precision limits under realistic circumstances? In this work we provide a general model for precision limits in two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry for non-perfect visibility. We show that the scaling of precision with visibility depends on the effective area in time-frequency phase space occupied by the state used as a probe, and we find that an optimal scaling exists. We demonstrate our results experimentally for different states in a set-up where the visibility can be controlled and reaches up to $99.5\%$. In the optimal scenario, a ratio of $0.97$ is observed between the experimental precision and the quantum limit, establishing a new benchmark in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resonance, i.e., amplification in transition probability available under certain conditions, offers a powerful means for determining fundamental quantities in physics, including the time duration of the second adopted in the SI units and neutron's electric dipole moment which is directly linked to CP violation. We revisit two of the typical examples, the Rabi resonance and the Ramsey resonance, and show that both of these represent the weak value amplification when involving significant enhancement of transition probabilities and that near the resonance points they share exactly the same behavior of transition probabilities except for the measurement strength whose difference leads to the known advantage of the Ramsey resonance in the sensitivity. Conversely, as a by-product of the relationship, we may measure the weak value through quantum resonance. In fact, we argue that previous measurements of neutron electric dipole moment based on the Ramsey resonance have potentially determined the weak value of neutron's spin with much higher precision than the conventional weak value measurement.</description>

Abstract: The potential synergy between quantum communications and future wireless communication systems is explored. By proposing a quantum-native or quantum-by-design philosophy, the survey examines technologies such as quantumdomain (QD) multi-input multi-output, QD non-orthogonal multiple access, quantum secure direct communication, QD resource allocation, QD routing, and QD artificial intelligence. The recent research advances in these areas are summarized. Given the behavior of photonic and particle-like Terahertz (THz) systems, a comprehensive system-oriented perspective is adopted to assess the feasibility of using quantum communications in future systems. This survey also reviews quantum optimization algorithms and quantum neural networks to explore the potential integration of quantum communication and quantum computing in future systems. Additionally, the current status of quantum sensing, quantum radar, and quantum timing is briefly reviewed in support of future applications. The associated research gaps and future directions are identified, including extending the entanglement coherence time, developing THz quantum communications devices, addressing challenges in channel estimation and tracking, and establishing the theoretical bounds and performance trade-offs of quantum communication, computing, and sensing. This survey offers a unique perspective on the potential for quantum communications to revolutionize future systems and pave the way for even more advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Cutting circuits with multiple two-qubit unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiprobabilistic cutting techniques allow us to partition large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits by replacing non-local gates with probabilistic mixtures of local gates. The cost of this method is a sampling overhead that scales exponentially in the number of cuts. It is crucial to determine the minimal cost for gate cutting and to understand whether allowing for classical communication between subcircuits can improve the sampling overhead. In this work, we derive a closed formula for the optimal sampling overhead for cutting an arbitrary number of two-qubit unitaries and provide the corresponding decomposition. We find that cutting several arbitrary two-qubit unitaries together is cheaper than cutting them individually and classical communication does not give any advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Improved Dispersive Qubit Readout with Squeezed Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing goal to improve dispersive qubit readout with squeezed light. However, injected external squeezing (IES) {\it cannot} enable a practically interesting increase in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and simultaneously, the increase of the SNR due to the use of intracavity squeezing (ICS) is even {\it negligible}. Here, we {\it counterintuitively} demonstrate that using IES and ICS together can lead to an {\it exponential} improvement of the SNR for any measurement time, corresponding to a measurement error reduced typically by many orders of magnitude. More remarkably, we find that in a short-time measurement, the SNR is even improved exponentially with {\it twice} the squeezing parameter. As a result, we predict a fast and high-fidelity readout. This work offers a promising path toward exploring squeezed light for dispersive qubit readout, with immediate applications in quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pursuit of quantum-enhanced parameter estimations without the need for nonclassical initial states has long been driven by the goal of achieving experimentally accessible quantum metrology. In this work, employing a coherent averaging mechanism, we prove that the prototypical cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, such as the Tavis-Cummings model, enables us to achieve not only the Heisenberg scaling (HS) precision in terms of the average photon number but also the double-HS sensitivity concerning both the average photon and atom numbers. Such a double sensibility can be experimentally realized by introducing either photon- or atom-number fluctuations through quantum squeezing. Furthermore, we discuss the methodology to achieve this double-HS precision in a realistic experimental circumstance where the squeezing is not perfect. Our results provide insights into understanding the coherent averaging mechanism for evaluating quantum-enhanced precision measurements and also present a usable metrological application of the cavity QED systems and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge. With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size, as long as the initial state is prepared in a low-energy sector of polynomial size. We achieve the latter via a pseudo-adiabatic sweep from a parameter regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We estimate that our algorithm has a polynomial runtime for systems where the spectral gap decreases at most polynomially in system size, and is faster than the adiabatic algorithm for a large range of settings. We generalize the algorithm to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Clifford twirling for cost-optimal quantum error mitigation in early FTQC regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twirling noise affecting quantum gates is essential in understanding and controlling errors, but applicable operations to noise are usually restricted by symmetries inherent in quantum gates. In this work, we propose symmetric Clifford twirling, a Clifford twirling utilizing only symmetric Clifford operators that commute with certain Pauli subgroups. We fully characterize how each Pauli noise is converted through the twirling and show that certain Pauli noise can be scrambled to a noise exponentially close to the global white noise. Moreover, we provide numerical demonstrations for highly structured circuits, such as Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuits, that noise effect on typical observables can be described by the global white noise. We further demonstrate that symmetric Clifford twirling and its hardware-efficient variant using only a local symmetric Clifford operators acting on a few logical qubits can significantly accelerate the scrambling. These findings enable us to mitigate errors in non-Clifford operations with minimal sampling overhead in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Noise-resilient and resource-efficient hybrid algorithm for robust quantum gap estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum algorithm for estimating gaps in many-body energy spectra, supported by an analytic proof of its inherent resilience to state preparation and measurement errors, as well as mid-circuit multi-qubit depolarizing noise. Our analysis extends to a broader class of Markovian noise, employing error mitigation strategies that optimize the utilization of quantum resources. By integrating trial-state optimization and classical signal processing into the algorithm, we amplify the signal peak corresponding to the exact target gap beyond the error threshold, thereby significantly reducing gap estimate errors. The algorithm's robustness is demonstrated through noisy simulations on the Qiskit Aer simulator and demonstrations on IBM Quantum processors. These results underscore the potential to enable accurate quantum simulations on near-term noisy quantum devices without resource-intensive error correction.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the entanglement evolution of three-qubit states in the presence of a spin chain environment. Utilizing negativity as a metric for entanglement assessment, we focus on the GHZ, W, and W_zeta quantum states as the initial system states.

      <title>Three-flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations on D-Wave's {\tt Advantage} Quantum Annealer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small numbers of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Investigating and Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Circuits: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have been widely explored to advance quantum circuits against classic models on various domains, such as quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. Similar to classic machine-learning models, VQCs can be trained through various optimization approaches, such as gradient-based or gradient-free methods. However, when employing gradient-based methods, the gradient variance of VQCs may dramatically vanish as the number of qubits or layers increases. This issue, a.k.a. Barren Plateaus (BPs), seriously hinders the scaling of VQCs on large datasets. To mitigate the barren plateaus, extensive efforts have been devoted to tackling this issue through diverse strategies. In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review of recent works from both investigation and mitigation perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy to categorize most existing mitigation strategies into five groups and introduce them in detail. Also, we compare the concurrent survey papers about BPs. Finally, we provide insightful discussion on future directions for BPs.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the study of multiparty entanglement by analyzing the behavior of collective variables. Throughout the manuscript, we explore a specific type of multiparty entanglement which can be detected through the fluctuation of a collective observable. We thoroughly analyze its properties and how it can be extended to mixed states while placing it within the context of the existing literature. The novelty of our approach also lies in the fact that we present a graphical point of view. This is done by introducing a spectral space on which the various properties of our entanglement quantifier have a direct pictorial interpretation. Notably, this approach proves particularly effective for assessing $k$-entanglement, as we show its ability to extend previously established inequalities. To enhance understanding, we also demonstrate how this framework applies to specific scenarios, encompassing both finite-dimensional cases and infinite-dimensional systems, the latter being exemplified by the time-frequency modal degree of freedom of co-propagating single photons.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.</description>

      <title>State estimation with quantum extreme learning machines beyond the scrambling time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) leverage untrained quantum dynamics to efficiently process information encoded in input quantum states, avoiding the high computational cost of training more complicated nonlinear models. On the other hand, quantum information scrambling (QIS) quantifies how the spread of quantum information into correlations makes it irretrievable from local measurements. Here, we explore the tight relation between QIS and the predictive power of QELMs. In particular, we show efficient state estimation is possible even beyond the scrambling time, for many different types of dynamics -- in fact, we show that in all the cases we studied, the reconstruction efficiency at long interaction times matches the optimal one offered by random global unitary dynamics. These results offer promising venues for robust experimental QELM-based state estimation protocols, as well as providing novel insights into the nature of QIS from a state estimation perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore how III-V semiconductor microring resonators can efficiently generate photon pairs and squeezed vacuum states via spontaneous parametric down-conversion by utilizing their built-in quasi phase matching and modal dispersion. We present an analytic expression for the biphoton wave function of photon pairs generated by weak pump pulses, and characterize the squeezed states that result under stronger pumping conditions. Our model includes loss, and captures the statistics of the scattered photons. A detailed sample calculation shows that for low pump powers conversion efficiencies of 10$^{-5}$, corresponding to a rate of $39$ MHz for a pump power of 1 $\mu$W, are attainable for rudimentary structures such as a simple microring coupled to a waveguide, in both the continuous wave and pulsed excitation regimes. Our results suggest that high levels of squeezing and pump depletion are attainable, possibly leading to the deterministic generation of non-Gaussian states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce energy exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state energy flow as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the energy flow fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electronic circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms for Maximum Cut on Low-Girth Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum cut (MaxCut) on graphs is a classic NP-hard problem. In quantum computing, Farhi, Gutmann, and Goldstone proposed the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving the MaxCut problem. Its guarantee on cut fraction (the fraction of edges in the output cut over all edges) was mainly studied for high-girth graphs, i.e., graphs with only long cycles. On the other hand, low-girth graphs are ubiquitous in theoretical computer science, including expander graphs being outstanding examples with wide applications in theory and beyond. In this paper, we apply QAOA to MaxCut on a set of expander graphs proposed by Mohanty and O'Donnell known as additive product graphs. Additionally, we apply multi-angle QAOA (ma-QAOA) to better utilize the graph structure of additive product graphs in ansatz design. In theory, we derive an iterative formula to calculate the expected cut fraction of such graphs. This formula also extends to the quantum MaxCut problem. On the other hand, we conduct numerical experiments to compare between best-known classical local algorithms and QAOA with constant depth. Our results demonstrate that QAOA outperforms the best-known classical algorithms by 0.3% to 5.2% on several additive product graphs, while ma-QAOA further enhances this advantage by an additional 0.6% to 2.5%. In particular, we observe cases that ma-QAOA exhibits superiority over best-known classical algorithms but QAOA does not. Furthermore, we extend our experiments to planar graphs such as tiling grid graphs, where QAOA also demonstrates an advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite perfect quantum strategies (BPQSs) allow two players isolated from each other to win every trial of a nonlocal game. BPQSs have crucial roles in recent developments in quantum information and quantum computation. However, only few BPQSs with a small number of inputs are known and only one of them has been experimentally tested. It has recently been shown that every BPQS has an associated Kochen-Specker (KS) set. Here, we first prove that any BPQS of minimum input cardinality that can be obtained from a generalized KS set can also be obtained from a KS set of pure states. Then, we address the problem of finding BPQSs of small input cardinality starting from KS sets. We introduce an algorithm that identifies the BPQS with the minimum number of settings for any given KS set. We apply it to many well-known KS sets of small cardinality in dimensions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. In each dimension, the algorithm either recovers the best BPQS known or find one with fewer inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically and computationally investigate the role that the spatial spread of atoms plays in the transmission and reflection of weak light from atom arrays. In particular, we investigate whether coherent wave functions for the atoms' positions leads to different results from a thermal distribution with the same spatial spread. We find that the coherence is not relevant when the light is weak and the electronic states evolve on time scales shorter than the oscillation period of the atoms in their traps. Full numerical calculations and derivations using the sudden approximation show that reflection and transmission agree with the simple averaging over atom positions for these conditions. For parameters outside these restrictions, the simple spatial averaging may lead to inaccurate results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit principles of quantum mechanics to accelerate the charging process and aim to achieve optimal energy storage. However, analytical results for investigating these problems remain lacking due to the challenges associated with nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we analytically investigate a central-spin QB model in which $N_b$ spin-1/2 battery cells interact with $N_c$ spin-1/2 charger units, using $m$ initially excited charger units as a resource. By employing the invariant subspace method and the shifted Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we identify four scenarios in which optimal energy storage can be achieved: (i) $N_b\!\ll\!m\!\ll\!N_c$; (ii) $m\!\ll\!N_b\!\ll\!N_c$; (iii) $m\!\ll\!N_c\!\ll\!N_b$; and (iv) $N_b\!\ll\!m\!=\!kN_c$ [$k\!\in\!(0,1)$]. In these cases, optimal storage is ensured by the SU(2) symmetry emerging from the charging dynamics. The first three cases map the central-spin QB to different Tavis-Cummings (TC) QBs, while the fourth corresponds to the non-TC limit. We analytically determine the charging time and demonstrate that in the fully charging cases (i) and (iv), the collective charging exhibits an $N_b$-fold enhancement in speedup compared to the parallel charging scheme. Additionally, we numerically observe a unified charging behavior when $m\!=\!N_c$, showing that asymptotically optimal energy storage is possible when $N_b\!=\!m\!=\!N_c$. In this case, we find a collective charging enhancement scaling as $N_b^{0.8264}$. The origin of the collective charging advantage in central-spin quantum batteries is also analyzed through the quantum speed limit and a multipartite entanglement witness. Our results highlight the crucial role of dynamically emergent SU(2) symmetry in providing an analytical understanding of non-equilibrium charging dynamics in QBs.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent radiative heat flux after the beginning of thermal radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts radiating at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts radiating, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux exhibits oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room- or higher-temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.</description>

      <title>Universal graph representation of stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a representation of $[[n, k]]$ stabilizer codes as graphs with certain structures. Specifically, the graphs take a semi-bipartite form wherein $k$ "input" nodes map to $n$ "output" nodes, such that output nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. We prove by passage through the ZX Calculus that this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an efficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We then show that this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a new universal recipe for code construction by way of finding graphs with sufficiently nice properties. The graph representation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the former, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes particularly at small scales. We construct as examples constant-size codes, e.g. a $[[54, 6, 5]]$ code and families of $[[n, \Theta(\frac{n}{\log n}), \Theta(\log n)]]$ and $[[n, \Omega(n^{3/5}), \Theta(n^{1/5}) ]]$ codes. We also leverage graphs in a probabilistic analysis to extend the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound into a three-way distance-rate-weight trade-off. To the latter, we show that key coding algorithms -- distance approximation, weight reduction, and decoding -- are unified as instances of a single optimization game on a graph. Moreover, key code properties such as distance, weight, and encoding circuit depth, are all controlled by the graph degree. Finally, we construct a simple efficient decoding algorithm and prove a performance guarantee for a certain class of graphs, including the above two families. This class contains all graphs of girth at least 9, building a bridge between stabilizer codes and extremal graph theory. These results give evidence that graphs are generically useful for the study of stabilizer codes and their practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Two-detector reconstruction of multiphoton states in linear optical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for partial state reconstruction of multiphoton states in multimode ($N$-photon $M$-mode) linear optical networks (LONs) employing only two bucket photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors. The reconstructed Heisenberg-Weyl-reduced density matrix captures quantum coherence and symmetry with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl operators. Employing deterministic quantum computing with one qubit (DQC1) circuits, we reduce the detector requirement from $M$ to $2$, while the requirement on measurement configurations is retained $2M^{3}-2M$. To ensure physicality, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is incorporated into the DQC1 reconstruction process, with numerical simulations demonstrating the efficiency of our approach and its robustness against interferometer noises. This method offers a resource-efficient solution for state characterization in large-scale LONs to advance photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Perturbative study of wave function evolution from source to detection of a single particle and the measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15409v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates through free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to a detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We consider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of the wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the detection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the slits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function evolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the vertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an approximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the function characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows wider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally collapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope of this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits. Hence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the Schroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is narrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit, where it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is lost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase information, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the y-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on the counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe the process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show this function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is closely related to the wave function.</description>

      <title>Heading towards an Algebraic Heisenberg Cut</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous papers we have explained how a sequence of theorems by John von Neumann on infinite tensor products (ITP) can be understood as providing elements to support both sectorisation of the Hilbert space of large quantum systems, and a mechanism of self decoherence thereof. These two effects may help understanding the articulation of the classical and quantum realms. However, as they involve considering an infinite number of quantum degrees of freedom, legitimate concerns can be raised on their applicability. In this paper, we address explicitly the interface between both realms through the example of a simplified model of a photon polarisation measurement device. Guided by the fact that there is von Neumann sectorisation at infinity, and by the necessity of classical contexts to perform measurements, we show that this limit can be under control, and that although the full force of the sectorisation theorems requires taking the infinite limit, early signs of the macroscopic behaviour appear before infinity. In our example, this shows up in photodiodes through diverging electron avalanches that simultaneously make the system classical, localise it randomly in a macroscopic sector and provide a macroscopic signal. This lays the grounds for justifying the inclusion in quantum physics of the ITP formalism, which involves non-separable Hilbert spaces and potentially type-III von Neumann algebras. Such an approach could make sense of the quantum-classical transition as a primarily algebraic one.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Two-Way Teleportation of Entangled States with Six-Qubit Cluster State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a two-way teleportation protocol for the transfer of an unknown two-qubit quantum state between two parties Alice and Bob, utilizing a six-qubit cluster state. This bidirectional exchange is achieved by performing Bell measurements on the qubit pairs of Alice and Bob, ensuring the successful teleportation of the quantum state for both parties. We demonstrate the proposed protocol by designing a teleportation circuit that incorporates the necessary quantum gates. The fidelity of the teleportation process is evaluated through simulations, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the proposed scheme. The protocol restores teleported states without requiring CNOT operations or auxiliary qubits, offering a significant advantage in resource efficiency(utilization). A comparative analysis of the intrinsic efficiency with previous approaches establishes that the proposed protocol brings forth an efficient approach for achieving two-way quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum compilation of metaplectic anyons based on the genetic optimized algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing holding global anti-interference ability is realized by braiding some anyons, such as well-known Fibonacci anyons. Here, based on $SO(3)_2$ theory we obtain a total of 6 anyon models utilizing F-matrices, R-symbols, and fusion rules of metaplectic anyon.We obtain the elementary braided matrices (EBMs) by means of unconventional encoding. After braid $X$ and $X'$, we insert a pair of $Z$ anyons into they to ensure that the initial order of anyons remains unchanged. In this process only fusion is required, and measurement is not necessary. Three of them $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$ are studied in detail. We study systematically the compilation of these three models through EBMs obtained analytically. For one-qubit case, the classical H- and T-gate can be well constructed using the genetic algorithm enhanced Solovay-Kitaev algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA) by $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$. The obtained accuracy of the H/T-gate by $\{V_3^{113}, V_1^{133}\}$ is slightly inferior to the corresponding gates of the Fibonacci anyon model, but it also can meet the requirements of fault-tolerant quantum computing, $V^3_131$ giving the best performance of these four models. For the two-qubit case, we use the exhaustive method for short lengths and the GA for long lengths to obtain braidword for $\{V_3^{113}, V_3^{131}, V_1^{133}\}$ models. The resulting matrices can well approximate the local equivalence class of the CNOT-gate, while demonstrating a much smaller error than the Fibonacci model, especially for the $V_3^{113}$.</description>

      <title>Decoherence time of the ground state spin of $V_{B}$ centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground-state spin of optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers a promising platform for quantum information applications, such as qubits for quantum computing and nanoscale sensing. A key characteristic of a qubit is its decoherence time, as its duration and controllability are critical for practical applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the electron spin dephasing time of the negatively charged boron vacancies, $V_{B}$ centers, in the hBN lattice by considering the dipolar hyperfine as well as spin-phonon interactions. We employ an approximate method based on the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to take into account a large number of nuclear spins and Debye model to consider the effect of lattice phonons. We show that, in the presence of the dipolar hyperfine interactions, Hahn-echo coherence time of the $V_{B}$ electron spin is approximately $30\: \mathrm{\mu s}$ at room temperature. Our results provide a step forward in understanding the $V_{B}$ defect decoherence in the hBN, which might be used for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropic Quantum Speed Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of generalized entropic quantum speed limits based on $\alpha$-$z$-R\'{e}nyi relative entropy, a real-valued, contractive, two-parameter family of distinguishability measures. The QSL falls into the class of Mandelstam-Tamm bounds, and applies to finite-dimensional quantum systems that undergo general physical process, i.e., their effective dynamics can be modeled by unitary or nonunitary evolutions. The results cover pure or mixed, separable and entangled probe quantum states. The QSL time depends on the smallest and largest eigenvalues of probe and instantaneous states of the system, and its evaluation requires low computational cost. In addition, it is inversely proportional to the time-average of the Schatten speed of the instantaneous state, which in turn is fully characterized by the considered dynamics. We specialize our results to the case of unitary and nonunitary evolutions. In the former case, the QSL scales with the inverse of the energy fluctuations, while the latter depends on the operator norm of the rate of change of the quantum channel Kraus operators. We illustrate our findings for single-qubit and two-qubit states, unitary and nonunitary evolutions. Our results may find applications in the study of entropic uncertainty relations, quantum metrology, and also entanglement entropies signaled by generalized entropies.</description>

Abstract: We present an asymptotically improved algorithm for implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) in both the exact and approximate settings. Historically, the approximate QFT has been implemented in $\Theta(n \log n)$ gates, and the exact in $\Theta(n^2)$ gates. In this work, we show that these costs can be reduced by leveraging a novel formulation of the QFT that recurses on two partitions of the qubits. Specifically, our approach yields an $\Theta(n(\log \log n)^2)$ algorithm for the approximate QFT using $\Theta(\log n)$ ancillas, and an $\Theta(n(\log n)^2)$ algorithm for the exact QFT requiring $\Theta(n)$ ancillas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exponentiation of Hamiltonians refers to a mathematical operation to a Hamiltonian operator, typically in the form e^(-i.t.H), where H is the Hamiltonian and t is a time parameter. This operation is fundamental in quantum mechanics, particularly to evolve quantum systems over time according to the Schrodinger equation.
  In quantum algorithms, such as Adiabatic methods and QAOA, exponentiation enables efficient simulation of a system dynamics.
  It involves constructing quantum circuits that approximate this exponential operation. When H=\sum_(p=1)^n H_p , each H_p is defined using the Pauli operator basis, which includes the well-known X, Y, Z and Id gates, i.e., H_p=U_1\otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n and U_k\in{Id,X,Y,Z}. In this article, we explore the exponentiation of H_p, specifically e^(-i.t.U_1 \otimes U_2\otimes \otimes U_n ), by introducing an algorithmic approach. We demonstrate a straightforward and efficient method to construct compact circuits that are easy to implement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate is a two-qubit controlled-phase gate in ion traps that is highly valued due to its ability to preserve the motional state of the ions. However, its fidelity is obstructed by errors affecting the motion of the ions as well as the rotation of the qubits. In this work, we propose an amplitude-modulated composite MS gate which features high fidelity robust to gate timing, detuning and coupling errors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <title>On Exact Space-Depth Trade-Offs in Multi-Controlled Toffoli Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the optimized implementation of Multi Controlled Toffoli (MCT) using the Clifford $+$ T gate sets. While there are several recent works in this direction, here we explicitly quantify the trade-off (with concrete formulae) between the Toffoli depth (this means the depth using the classical 2-controlled Toffoli) of the $n$-controlled Toffoli (hereform we will tell $n$-MCT) and the number of clean ancilla qubits. Additionally, we achieve a reduced Toffoli depth (and consequently, T-depth), which is an extension of the technique introduced by Khattar et al. (2024). In terms of a negative result, we first show that using such conditionally clean ancilla techniques, Toffoli depth can never achieve exactly $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, though it remains of the same order. This highlights the limitation of the techniques exploiting conditionally clean ancilla [Nie et al., 2024, Khattar et al., 2024]. Then we prove that, in a more general setup, the T-Depth in the Clifford + T decomposition, via Toffoli gates, is lower bounded by $\ceil{\log_2 n}$, and this bound is achieved following the complete binary tree structure. Since the ($2$-controlled) Toffoli gate can further be decomposed using Clifford $+$ T, various methodologies are explored too in this regard for trade-off related implications.</description>

      <title>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and do distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample.
  Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles.
  The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</description>

      <title>Backflash Attack on Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we experimentally demonstrate an eavesdropper's (Eve's) information gain by exploiting the breakdown flash generated by the single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) used in coherent one-way quantum key distribution (COW-QKD) setup. Unlike prior studies focusing on the device-level characterization of backflash photons, this work quantifies Eve's learning with a QKD system that includes a key distillation engine (KDE). Eve's learning is quantified using the backflash photons emitted by SPAD and the information available on the classical channel. Experimentally observed data are in good agreement with theoretical simulations. Some mitigation strategies against the backflash attack are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Control for Bragg Pulse Design in Atom Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a robust optimal control algorithm to synthesize minimum energy pulses that can transfer a cold atom system into various momentum states. The algorithm uses adaptive linearization of the evolution operator and sequential quadratic programming to iterate the control towards a minimum energy signal that achieves optimal target state fidelity. Robustness to parameter variation is achieved using Legendre polynomial approximation over the domain of variation. The method is applied to optimize the Bragg beamsplitting operation in ultra-cold atom interferometry. Even in the presence of 10-40% variability in the initial momentum dispersion of the atomic cloud and the intensity of the optical pulse, the algorithm reliably converges to a control protocol that robustly achieves unprecedented momentum levels with high fidelity for a single-frequency multi-photon Bragg diffraction scheme (e.g. $|\pm 40\hbar k\rangle$). Advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison to stochastic optimization using sampled parameter values.</description>

      <title>A Variant of the Bravyi-Terhal Bound for Arbitrary Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified version of the Bravyi-Terhal bound that applies to quantum codes defined by local parity-check constraints on a $D$-dimensional lattice quotient. Specifically, we consider a quotient $\mathbb{Z}^D/\Lambda$ of $\mathbb{Z}^D$ of cardinality $n$, where $\Lambda$ is some $D$-dimensional sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^D$: we suppose that every vertex of this quotient indexes $m$ qubits of a stabilizer code $C$, which therefore has length $nm$. We prove that if all stabilizer generators act on qubits whose indices lie within a ball of radius $\rho$, then the minimum distance $d$ of the code satisfies $d \leq m\sqrt{\gamma_D}(\sqrt{D} + 4\rho)n^\frac{D-1}{D}$ whenever $n^{1/D} \geq 8\rho\sqrt{\gamma_D}$, where $\gamma_D$ is the $D$-dimensional Hermite constant. We apply this bound to derive an upper bound on the minimum distance of Abelian Two-Block Group Algebra (2BGA) codes whose parity-check matrices have the form $[\mathbf{A} \, \vert \, \mathbf{B}]$ with each submatrix representing an element of a group algebra over a finite abelian group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that classical DNA unzipping transition which is equivalently described by quantum mechanical localization-delocalization transition in the ground state of non-Hermitian single impurity Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian is underpinned by generalized parity ({\bf P})-time reversal ({\bf T}) symmetry breaking transition. We also study the one-dimensional discretized version of Hatano-Nelson model in the presence of the single impurity and random disorder on a finite-size lattice. These discrete models are useful to study unzipping of a single adsorbed polymer from a surface. Our results show that the discrete models also undergo a phase transition from a PT unbroken phase to a broken phase. Interestingly, the generalized PT phase transition points coincide with the localization-delocalization transition for continuum as well as lattice models.</description>

Abstract: Kato's well known distributional inequality for the magnetic Laplacian holds equally in the more general setting of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED), where the wave function is vector-valued and the vector potential is quantized. We give two new applications of this result: First, we show that eigenstates satisfy a subsolution estimate. Second, for general states, with energy distribution strictly below the ionization threshold, we give a short proof of pointwise exponential decay in the electronic configuration.</description>

      <title>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the operator growth hypothesis with questions of localization. We analytically show that an almost factorial growth of the operator norm - as recently proven for the random Ising model - is inconsistent with an exponential localization of $A$. Assuming that a quasi-local unitary $U$ exists which maps $H$ onto an effective Hamiltonian $\tilde H=UHU^\dagger=\sum_n E_n \tau^z_n +\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \tau^z_i\tau^z_j+\dots$, we show that $\tilde A=UAU^\dagger$ is a quasi-local operator which in the many-body case does not remain exponentially localized in general leading to an almost factorial norm growth. Therefore the unitary $U$ in many-body systems with maximal norm growth either does not exist and such systems are always ergodic or unusual non-ergodic phases described by $\tilde H$ do exist which violate the operator growth hypothesis and in which operators spread, implying that transport will eventually set in. We analytically and symbolically verify our results for the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models. For the XXX case, the symbolic calculations are consistent with a maximal norm growth. Furthermore, we find no indication of a weakened exponential localization of $A$, expected for strong disorder and low commutator orders if the unitary $U$ does exist. Finally, we try to perturbatively construct $U$ by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. While it is straightforward to show that this construction converges in the Anderson case, we find no indications for a convergence in the interacting case, suggesting that $U$ does not exist and that many-body localization is absent.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bosonic Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a global monopole (GM) spacetime in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity and a Wu-Yang magnetic monopole (WYMM). We discuss the gravitational effects in the presence of Ricci scalar curvature $R=R_{\upsilon }^{\upsilon }$. It is observed that the presence of the Ricci scalar curvature, effectively and manifestly, introduces a force field that makes the corresponding quantum mechanical repulsive core more repulsive. Similar effect is also observed for the EiBI-gravitational field. We reiterate and report that the corresponding bosonic KG-oscillator quantum mechanical system admits a solution in the form of confluent Heun functions, the truncation of which into a physically admissible polynomial is shown to be associated with some parametric correlations/conditions. The use of such conditions/correlations is mandatory and yields a set of allowed/restricted quantum mechanical orbital $\ell $-excitations, for all radial quantum numbers $n_{r}\geq 0$. Our procedure is shown to be quite handy, in the since that it allows one to retrieve results for KG-oscillators in GM-spacetime in different EiBI-gravity and Ricci scalar curvature settings.</description>

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.</description>

Abstract: Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Generation and Stabilization by Coherent Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a continuous superradiant laser on the sub-mHz $^1$S$_0\,\rightarrow\,^3$P$_0$ transition in neutral strontium-88</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous superradiance using a narrow optical transition has the potential to improve the short-term stability of state-of-the-art optical clocks. Even though pulsed superradiant emission on a mHz linewidth clock transition has been shown, true continuous operation, without Fourier limitation, has turned out to be extremely challenging. The trade-off between maintaining a high atomic flux while minimizing decoherence effects presents a significant obstacle. Here, we discuss the design of a machine that could overcome this problem by combining a high-flux continuous beam of ultra cold strontium atoms with a bowtie cavity for the generation of superradiant lasing. To evaluate the feasibility of our design, we present simulation results for continuous high-efficiency cooling, loading, and pumping to the upper lasing state inside the bowtie cavity. We then present two different models for stimulating the generated superradiant field by taking into account position-dependent shifts, collisional decoherence, light shifts, and atom loss. Finally, we estimate a laser linewidth of less than 100 mHz, limited by atom number fluctuations, and resulting in an output power of hundreds of fW.</description>

      <title>Duality via Sequential Quantum Circuit in the Topological Holography Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two quantum theories which look different but are secretly describing the same low-energy physics are said to be dual to each other. When realized in the Topological Holography formalism, duality corresponds to changing the gapped boundary condition on the top boundary of a topological field theory, which determines the symmetry of the system, while not affecting the bottom boundary where all the dynamics take place. In this paper, we show that duality in the Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combinatorial approach to obtain exact expressions for the many-body density of states of fermionic and bosonic gases with equally spaced single-particle spectra. We identify a mapping that reveals a remarkable property, namely, fermionic and bosonic gases have the same many-body density of states, up to a shift corresponding to ground state energy. Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, for example for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</description>

      <title>Correlation hypergraph: a new representation of a quantum marginal independence pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the quantum marginal independence problem, namely the question of which faces of the subadditivity cone are achievable by quantum states. We introduce a new representation of the patterns of marginal independence (PMIs, corresponding to faces of the subadditivity cone) based on certain correlation hypergraphs, and demonstrate that this representation provides a more efficient description of a PMI, and consequently of the set of PMIs which are compatible with strong subadditivity. We then show that these correlation hypergraphs generalize to arbitrary quantum systems the well known relation between positivity of mutual information and connectivity of entanglement wedges in holography, and further use this representation to derive new results about the combinatorial structure of collections of simultaneously decorrelated subsystems specifying SSA-compatible PMIs. In the context of holography, we apply these techniques to derive a necessary condition for the realizability of entropy vectors by simple tree graph models, which were conjectured in arXiv:2204.00075 to provide the building blocks of the holographic entropy cone. Since this necessary condition is formulated in terms of chordality of a certain graph, it can be tested efficiently.</description>

      <title>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Traversable AdS Wormhole via Non-local Double Trace or Janus Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study (i) Janus deformations and (ii) non-local double trace deformations of a pair of CFTs, as two different ways to construct CFT duals of traversable AdS wormholes. First, we construct a simple model of traversable wormholes by gluing two Poincar\'e AdS geometries and BTZ black holes and compute holographic two point functions and (pseudo) entanglement entropy. We point out that a Janus gravity solution describes a traversable wormhole when the deformation parameter takes imaginary values. On the other hand, we show that double trace deformations between two decoupled CFTs can reproduce two point functions of traversable AdS wormholes. By considering the case where the double trace deformation is given by a non-local $T\overline{T}$ deformation, we analyze the dual gravity which implies emergence of wormholes. We present toy model of these deformed CFTs by using free scalars and obtain qualitative behaviors expected for them. We argue that the crucial difference between the two constructions is that a global time slice of wormhole is described by a pure state for Janus deformations, while it is a mixed state for the double trace deformations.</description>

      <title>Reed-Muller Codes on CQ Channels via a New Correlation Bound for Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether Reed-Muller (RM) codes achieve capacity on binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels has drawn attention since it was resolved positively for the binary erasure channel by Kudekar et al. in 2016. In 2021, Reeves and Pfister extended this to prove the bit-error probability vanishes on BMS channels when the code rate is less than capacity. In 2023, Abbe and Sandon improved this to show the block-error probability also goes to zero. These results analyze decoding functions using symmetry and the nested structure of RM codes. In this work, we focus on binary-input symmetric classical-quantum (BSCQ) channels and the Holevo capacity. For a BSCQ, we consider observables that estimate the channel input in the sense of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE). Using the orthogonal decomposition of these observables under a weighted inner product, we establish a recursive relation for the minimum MSE estimate of a single bit in the RM code. Our results show that any set of $2^{o(\sqrt{\log N})}$ bits can be decoded with a high probability when the code rate is less than the Holevo capacity.</description>

      <title>Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>
