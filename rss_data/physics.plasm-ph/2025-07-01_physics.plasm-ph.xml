      <title>Probing the transition from classical to quantum radiation reaction in relativistic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transition from classical radiation reaction, described by the Landau-Lifshitz model, to the quantum mechanical regime. The plasma is subject to a circularly polarized field where the self-consistent plasma current is the source of the electromagnetic field through Ampere's law. The radiation reaction implies wave energy loss, frequency up-conversion, and a modified distribution function. Increasing the value of the quantum $\chi$-parameter, the quantum results gradually differ from the classical ones. Moreover, the deviation between models also depends on the plasma parameters, including density and temperature. We discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Variational hydrodynamics of the classical Yukawa one-component plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a recently developed variational approach to the hydrodynamics of strongly coupled plasmas [D. Krimans and S. Putterman, Phys. Fluids 36, 037131 (2024)] and extend it to the Yukawa one-component plasma. This approach generalizes the ordinary hydrodynamic equations to finite length scales by explicitly including terms that depend on the pair distribution function. After discussing the form of the Lagrangian, we derive equations of motion and explicit formulas for the momentum and energy conservation laws. After demonstrating consistency with thermodynamics, we consider the simpler linear regime and the dispersion laws. By comparing the longitudinal speed of sound to existing numerical data, we find excellent agreement in the weak to moderate screening regimes, while discrepancies arise at strong screening. The finite-wavelength behavior of the longitudinal dispersion relation also shows excellent agreement with simulations across a wide range of coupling and screening parameters, even when the wavelength is comparable to the average interparticle spacing. In addition to the linear regime, our variational approach has potential for application to nonlinear problems and other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Investigation of resonant layer response in electron viscosity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a supplementary study of previous work in Waybright and Park [Phys. Plasmas 31, 022502 (2024)] which demonstrates a substantial effect of electron viscosity on the resonant layer response to non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbations. A main refinement is to include a curl element of electron viscosity in the generalized Ohm's law. The refinement reveals a resonant layer response in the Electron Viscosity (EV) regime corresponding to slowly rotating and highly viscous plasmas.</description>

      <title>Alloharmonics in Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Burst Intensification by Singularity Emitting Radiation (BISER) in underdense relativistic laser plasma is a bright source of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and x-ray radiation. In contrast to all harmonic generation mechanisms, high-resolution experimental BISER spectra in the XUV region contain spectral fringes with separation much finer (down to 0.12 eV) than the initial driving laser frequency (~1.5 eV). We show that these fringe separations result from two main factors: laser frequency downshift (redshift) due to the quasi-adiabatic energy loss to the plasma waves, and spectral interference of different harmonic orders from different emission moments, i.e. alloharmonics [Pirozhkova et al., arXiv:2306.01018]</description>

      <title>The interaction of turbulence, magnetic islands and zonal fields in fluid plasma models with cubic non-linearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that magnetic islands generated by pressure-gradient-driven turbulence are common across a wide range of conditions. The interaction among turbulence, magnetic island and other large scale structures (the zonal flow and the zonal current), largely determines the dynamics of the system. Turbulence takes a background role, providing energy to the large-scale structures, without influencing their evolution directly. The growth of the zonal current is linearly related to that of the magnetic island, while the zonal flow has a strongly sheared region where the island has its maximum radial extension. The zonal current is found to slow down the formation of large-scale magnetic islands, while the zonal flow is needed to have the system move its energy to larger and larger scales. The driving instability in the system is the fluid Kinetic Ballooning Mode (KBM) instability at high beta, while the tearing mode is kept stable. The formation of magnetic-island-like structures at the spatial scale of the fluid KBM instability is observed quite early in the non-linear phase for most cases studied, and a slow coalescence process evolves the magnetic structures towards larger and larger scales. Cases that did not show this coalescence process, nor the formation of the small scale island-like structures, were seen to have narrower mode structures for comparable instability growth rates, which was achieved by varying the magnetic shear. The islands often end up exceeding the radial box size late in the non-linear phase, showing unbounded growth. The impact on the pressure profile of turbulence driven magnetic islands is not trivial, showing flattening of the pressure profile only far from the resonance, where the zonal flow is weaker, and the appearance of said flattening is slow, after the island has reached a sufficiently large size, when compared with collisional time scales.</description>

      <title>Plasma Accelerator For Decaying Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a plasma wakefield acceleration scheme capable of boosting initially subrelativistic particles to relativistic velocities within millimeter-scale distances. A subluminal light pulse drives a wake whose velocity is continuously matched to the beam speed through a tailored plasma density, thereby extending the dephasing length. We develop a theoretical model that is generalizable across particle mass, initial velocity, and the particular accelerating bucket being used, and we verify its accuracy with particle-in-cell simulations using laser drivers with energies in the Joule range.</description>

      <title>High brightness multi-MeV photon source driven by a petawatt-scale laser wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of a bright multi-MeV gamma source driven by a petawatt laser. The source generates on average $(1.2\pm0.6)\times10^9$ photons above 1 MeV per pulse, exceeding those of previous all-optical sources by a hundred times, and reached a peak spectral brightness of $(3.9 \pm 1.5)\times 10^{22}$ photons/mm$^2$/mrad$^2$/s/0.1%BW at $\epsilon_\gamma\approx11$ MeV. The source was produced by inverse Compton scattering of a laser wakefield accelerated GeV electron beam and its back-reflected driving laser pulse, and is well described by a simple model of the laser and electron properties at the collision point. Our results highlight the promise of this source for fundamental physics studies, as well as for applications of nuclear resonance fluorescence and nuclear transmutation.</description>

      <title>The impacts of tropospheric gravity wave-generated MSTIDs on skywaves at middle latitude North American sector observed and modeled using SuperDARN HF radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trans-ionospheric high frequency (HF: 3-30 MHz) response to gravity waves (GWs) is studied in the middle-latitude ionosphere in relation to thunderstorm activity. SuperDARN HF radar observations are compared against the model simulations to quantify the impact of GW-generated MSTID (medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances) activity on the skywaves traveling through ionospheric F-region heights. The tropospheric thunderstorm-driven convective source is modeled using MAGIC. The outputs are coupled with GEMINI to model ionospheric plasma response, which is then used to model SuperDARN HF radar observations using the PHaRLAP raytracing tool. Semi-concentric GWs were observed at different atmospheric heights, creating MSTIDs at F-region heights. PHaRLAP raytracing through the modeled ionosphere shows great qualitative agreement with SuperDARN daytime ground scatter observations. Modeled rays show possibilities of long ducting Pedersen rays, suggesting MSTID can create a plasma waveguide to duct rays at the F-region height.</description>

      <title>Absorption of electromagnetic waves at oblique resonance in plasmas threaded by inhomogenous magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been significant interest lately in the study of Electromagnetic (EM) waves interacting with magnetized plasmas. The variety of resonances and the existence of several pass and stop bands in the dispersion curve for different orientations of the magnetic field offer new mechanisms of EM wave energy absorption \cite{PhysRevE.105.055209,Juneja_2023,vashistha2020new}. However, earlier studies have investigated only special cases of magnetized plasma geometry (e.g., RL mode $(\vec{k}||\vec{B}_{ext}$) or $(\vec{k}\perp\vec{B}_{ext})$ X,O-mode configuration). In these specific cases, EM waves encounter specific resonances (e.g. for $(\theta=0)$ cyclotron resonances, and for $(\theta=\pi/2)$, hybrid resonances). A general case of EM wave propagation is at an oblique angle with respect to the externally applied magnetic field $\vec{B}_{ext}$ has been considered here. Furthermore, the magnetic field is chosen to be inhomogeneous such that the EM wave pulse encounters a resonance layer within the plasma medium. A 2-D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation using the OSIRIS 4.0 platform has been carried out for these studies. A significant enhancement in absorption leading to almost complete absorption of laser energy by the plasma has been observed. A detailed study characterizing the role of the external magnetic field profile, EM wave intensity, etc., has also been carried out.</description>

      <title>Non-local, diamagnetic electromagnetic effects in magnetically insulated transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the time-dependent physics responsible for the critical reduction of current losses in magnetically insulated transmission lines (MITLs) due to uninsulated space charge limited (SCL) currents of electrons emitted by field stress. A drive current of sufficiently short pulse length introduces a strong enough time dependence that steady state results alone become inadequate for the complete understanding of current losses. The time-dependent physics can be described as a non-local, diamagnetic electromagnetic response of space charge limited currents. As the pulse length is increased or equivalently, the MITL length reduced, these time-dependent effects diminish and current losses converge to those predicted by the well-known Child-Langmuir law in the external (vacuum) fields. We present a simple one-dimensional (1D) model that encapsulates the essence of this physics. We find excellent agreement with 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations for two MITL geometries, Cartesian parallel plate and azimuthally symmetric straight coaxial. Based on the 1D model, we explore various scaling dependencies of MITL losses with relevant parameters, e.g., peak current, pulse length, geometrical dimensions, etc. We propose an improved physics model of magnetic insulation in the form of a Hull curve, which could also help improve predictions of current losses by common circuit element codes, such as BERTHA. Lastly, we describe how to calculate temperature rise due to electron impact within the 1D model.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Helical-rotating Plasma Structures in Beam-generated Partially Magnetized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal structures emerging in beam-generated partially magnetized plasmas are investigated using three-dimensional particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations. Two distinct instability regimes are identified at low pressures. When the gas pressure is sufficiently high, quasi-neutrality is attained and 2D spiral-arm structures form as a result of the development of a lower-hybrid instability, resulting in enhanced cross-field transport. At lower pressures, quasi-neutrality is not achieved and a 3D helical-rotating plasma structure forms due to development of the diocotron instability. Analytical formulas are proposed for the critical threshold pressure between these regimes and for the rotation frequency of the helical structures. Preliminary experimental verification is provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient mechanism of laser pulse focusing with the help of shaped underdense plasma target immersed in inhomogeneous magnetic field has been demonstrated. These studies have been carried out with the help of 2-D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation employing the OSIRIS 4.0 platform. It is shown that the divergent magnetic field profile compresses the EM wave pulse in the transverse direction. A comparative investigation with plane and lens shaped plasma geometries has also been conducted to find an optimal configuration for focusing the laser at the desirable location. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that when the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) layer is placed at a suitable location where the laser is focused, a highly energetic electron beam gets generated.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>
