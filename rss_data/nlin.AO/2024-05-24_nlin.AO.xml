      <title>Synchronization through frequency shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of engineered and natural systems are modelled as networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators. In nature, the intrinsic frequencies of these oscillators are not constant in time. Here, we probe the effect of such a temporal heterogeneity on coupled oscillator networks, through the lens of the Kuramoto model. To do this, we shuffle repeatedly the intrinsic frequencies among the oscillators at either random or regular time intervals. What emerges is the remarkable effect that frequent shuffling induces earlier onset (i.e., at a lower coupling) of synchrony among the oscillator phases. Our study provides a novel strategy to induce and control synchrony under resource constraints. We demonstrate our results analytically and in experiments with a network of Wien Bridge oscillators with internal frequencies being shuffled in time.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metastability in frustrated oscillatory networks: the key role of hierarchical modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory complex networks in the metastable regime have been used to study the emergence of integrated and segregated activity in the brain, which are hypothesised to be fundamental for cognition. Yet, the parameters and the underlying mechanisms necessary to achieve the metastable regime are hard to identify, often relying on maximising the correlation with empirical functional connectivity dynamics. Here, we propose and show that the brain's hierarchically modular mesoscale structure alone can give rise to robust metastable dynamics and (metastable) chimera states in the presence of phase frustration. We construct unweighted $3$-layer hierarchical networks of identical Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators, parameterized by the average degree of the network and a structural parameter determining the ratio of connections between and within blocks in the upper two layers. Together, these parameters affect the characteristic timescales of the system. Away from the critical synchronization point, we detect the emergence of metastable states in the lowest hierarchical layer coexisting with chimera and metastable states in the upper layers. Using the Laplacian renormalization group flow approach, we uncover two distinct pathways towards achieving the metastable regimes detected in these distinct layers. In the upper layers, we show how the symmetry-breaking states depend on the slow eigenmodes of the system. In the lowest layer instead, metastable dynamics can be achieved as the separation of timescales between layers reaches a critical threshold. Our results show an explicit relationship between metastability, chimera states, and the eigenmodes of the system, bridging the gap between harmonic based studies of empirical data and oscillatory models.</description>

      <title>Imitation dynamics and the replicator equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has impacted many fields of research by providing a mathematical framework for studying the evolution and maintenance of social and moral behaviors. This success is owed in large part to the demonstration that the central equation of this theory - the replicator equation - is the deterministic limit of a stochastic imitation (social learning) dynamics. Here we offer an alternative elementary proof of this result, which holds for the scenario where players compare their instantaneous (not average) payoffs to decide whether to maintain or change their strategies, and only more successful individuals can be imitated.</description>
