      <title>Hidden collective oscillations in a disordered mean-field spin model with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of introducing separable quenched disorder on a non-equilibrium mean-field spin model exhibiting a phase transition to an oscillating state in the absence of disorder, due to non-reciprocal interactions. In the disordered model, the magnetisation and its time derivative no longer carry the signature of the phase transition to an oscillating state. However, thanks to the separable (Mattis-type) form of the disorder, the presence of oscillations can be revealed by introducing a specific, disorder-dependent observable. We also introduce generalised linear and non-linear susceptibilities associated either with the magnetisation or with its time derivative. While linear susceptibilities show no sign of a phase transition, the third-order susceptibilities present a clear signature of the onset of an oscillating phase. In addition, we show that the overlap distribution also provides evidence for the presence of oscillations, without explicit knowledge of the disorder.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations lead to glassy electron dynamics in the good metal regime of electron doped KTaO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in condensed matter physics is to comprehend systems that have strong disorder and strong interactions. In the strongly localized regime, their subtle competition leads to glassy electron dynamics which ceases to exist well before the insulator-to-metal transition is approached as a function of doping. Here, we report on the discovery of glassy electron dynamics deep inside the good metal regime of an electron-doped quantum paraelectric system: KTaO$_3$. We reveal that upon excitation of electrons from defect states to the conduction band, the excess injected carriers in the conduction band relax in a stretched exponential manner with a large relaxation time, and the system evinces simple aging phenomena - a telltale sign of glassy dynamics. Most significantly, we observe a critical slowing down of carrier dynamics below 35 K, concomitant with the onset of quantum paraelectricity in the undoped KTaO$_3$. Our combined investigation using second harmonic generation technique, density functional theory and phenomenological modeling demonstrates quantum fluctuation-stabilized soft polar modes as the impetus for the glassy behavior. This study addresses one of the most fundamental questions regarding the potential promotion of glassiness by quantum fluctuations and opens a route for exploring glassy dynamics of electrons in a well-delocalized regime.</description>

      <title>Crystalline topological defects within response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal defects can highlight interesting quantum features by coupling to the low-energy Hamiltonian $H$. Here we show that independently of this $H$ coupling, topological crystalline defects can generate new features by directly modifying the response theory of electric field probes such as Raman scattering. To show this we consider an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 model $H_{spin}$ on a zigzag chain. Crystalline domain walls between two zigzag domains appear as at most local defects in $H_{spin}$, but as topological (not locally creatable) defects in the Raman operator $R$ of inelastic photon scattering. Using time evolving block decimation (TEBD) numerics, mean field, and bosonization, we show that a finite density of crystalline domain walls shifts the entire Raman signal to produce an effective gap. This lattice-defect-induced Raman gap closes and reopens in applied magnetic fields. We discuss the effect in terms of photons sensing the lattice defects within $R$ as spin-dimerization domain walls, with $Z_2$ character, and a resulting shift of the probed wavevector from $q=0$ to $\pi+\delta q$, giving an $\textit{O}(1)$ change in contrast to local defects. The magneto-Raman singularity from topological lattice defects here relies on the $H_{spin}$ spinon liquid state, suggesting future applications using lattice topological defects to modify response-theory operators independently of $H$ and thereby generate new probes of quantum phases.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm to Simulate Nonlinear Resistive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog electrical networks have long been investigated as energy-efficient computing platforms for machine learning, leveraging analog physics during inference. More recently, resistor networks have sparked particular interest due to their ability to learn using local rules (such as equilibrium propagation), enabling potentially important energy efficiency gains for training as well. Despite their potential advantage, the simulations of these resistor networks has been a significant bottleneck to assess their scalability, with current methods either being limited to linear networks or relying on realistic, yet slow circuit simulators like SPICE. Assuming ideal circuit elements, we introduce a novel approach for the simulation of nonlinear resistive networks, which we frame as a quadratic programming problem with linear inequality constraints, and which we solve using a fast, exact coordinate descent algorithm. Our simulation methodology significantly outperforms existing SPICE-based simulations, enabling the training of networks up to 327 times larger at speeds 160 times faster, resulting in a 50,000-fold improvement in the ratio of network size to epoch duration. Our approach can foster more rapid progress in the simulations of nonlinear analog electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Spectral Flow for the Riemann zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, with Mussardo we defined a quantum mechanical problem of a single particle scattering with impurities wherein the quantized energy levels $E_n (\sigma)$ are exactly equal to the zeros of the Riemann $\zeta (s)$ where $\sigma = \Re (s)$ in the limit $\sigma \to 1/2$. The S-matrix is based on the Euler product and is unitary by construction, thus the underlying hamiltonian is hermitian and all eigenvalues must be real. Motivated by the Hilbert-P\'olya idea we study the spectral flows for $\{ E_n (\sigma) \}$. This leads to a simple criterion for the validity of the Riemann Hypothesis. The spectral flow arguments are simple enough that we present analogous results for the Generalized and Grand Riemann Hypotheses. We also illustrate our results for a counter example where the Riemann Hypothesis is violated since there is no underlying unitary S-matrix due to the lack of an Euler product.</description>
