      <title>Anomaly Detection Within Mission-Critical Call Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasingly larger and more complex telecommunication networks, there is a need for improved monitoring and reliability. Requirements increase further when working with mission-critical systems requiring stable operations to meet precise design and client requirements while maintaining high availability.
  This paper proposes a novel methodology for developing a machine learning model that can assist in maintaining availability (through anomaly detection) for client-server communications in mission-critical systems. To that end, we validate our methodology for training models based on data classified according to client performance. The proposed methodology evaluates the use of machine learning to perform anomaly detection of a single virtualized server loaded with simulated network traffic (using SIPp) with media calls. The collected data for the models are classified based on the round trip time performance experienced on the client side to determine if the trained models can detect anomalous client side performance only using key performance indicators available on the server.
  We compared the performance of seven different machine learning models by testing different trained and untrained test stressor scenarios. In the comparison, five models achieved an F1-score above 0.99 for the trained test scenarios. Random Forest was the only model able to attain an F1-score above 0.9 for all untrained test scenarios with the lowest being 0.980. The results suggest that it is possible to generate accurate anomaly detection to evaluate degraded client-side performance.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Adaptive Huber Loss (RAHL) -- Design of an improved Huber loss for CQI prediction in 5G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) plays a pivotal role in 5G networks, optimizing infrastructure dynamically to ensure high Quality of Service (QoS). Recent research has focused on improving CQI estimation in 5G networks using machine learning. In this field, the selection of the proper loss function is critical for training an accurate model. Two commonly used loss functions are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Roughly speaking, MSE put more weight on outliers, MAE on the majority. Here, we argue that the Huber loss function is more suitable for CQI prediction, since it combines the benefits of both MSE and MAE. To achieve this, the Huber loss transitions smoothly between MSE and MAE, controlled by a user-defined hyperparameter called delta. However, finding the right balance between sensitivity to small errors (MAE) and robustness to outliers (MSE) by manually choosing the optimal delta is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss function, named Residual-based Adaptive Huber Loss (RAHL). In RAHL, a learnable residual is added to the delta, enabling the model to adapt based on the distribution of errors in the data. Our approach effectively balances model robustness against outliers while preserving inlier data precision. The widely recognized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed in conjunction with RAHL, showcasing significantly improved results compared to the aforementioned loss functions. The obtained results affirm the superiority of RAHL, offering a promising avenue for enhanced CQI prediction in 5G networks.</description>

      <title>Generative-AI for AI/ML Model Adaptive Retraining in Beyond 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond fifth-generation (B5G) networks aim to support high data rates, low-latency applications, and massive machine communications. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) can help to improve B5G network performance and efficiency. However, dynamic service demands of B5G use cases cause AI/ML model performance degradation, resulting in Service Level Agreements (SLA) violations, over- or under-provisioning of resources, etc. Retraining is essential to address the performance degradation of the AI/ML models. Existing threshold and periodic retraining approaches have potential disadvantages, such as SLA violations and inefficient resource utilization for setting a threshold parameter in a dynamic environment. This paper proposes a novel approach that predicts when to retrain AI/ML models using Generative Artificial Intelligence. The proposed predictive approach is evaluated for a Quality of Service Prediction use case on the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Software Community platform and compared to the predictive approach based on the classifier and a threshold approach. Also, a realtime dataset from the Colosseum testbed is considered to evaluate Network Slicing (NS) use case with the proposed predictive approach. The results show that the proposed predictive approach outperforms both the classifier-based predictive and threshold approaches.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Airalo Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, we have witnessed myriad flavours of Mobile Network Aggregators (MNAs) which exploit the coverage footprint of a handful of base operators to provide global mobile connectivity. Under the MNA model, emerging operators reap the benefits of network softwarization and virtualization, including eSIM technology or control/data-plane separation. This paper investigates an emergent MNA type - a thick MNA - that relies on multiple (core) base operators from different economies to provision eSIM profiles, while employing gateway functions to the public internet located outside the respective base operators' home country. Specifically, our work is the first to capture the intricacies of Airalo - a thick MNA that operates in 219 countries. Unlike other MNAs that our community scrutinized, we show that Airalo often decouples the geographical location of the public internet gateway from the native country of the base operator via IPX Hub Breakout (IHBO). To map Airalo's underlying infrastructure, we ran web-based measurements that 14 volunteers performed while traveling and using an Airalo eSIM on their personal devices. We further dive into Airalo's performance by running device-based measurements (speedtest, traceroute, video streaming, etc.) in 10 countries with rooted Android devices. Finally, we examine Airalo's pricing by monitoring its marketplace.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Spectrum Management for 6G Network-in-Network Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible, self-organizing communication networks will be a key feature in the next mobile communication standard. Network-in-Network (NiN) is one important concept in 6G research, introducing sub-networks tailored to specific application requirements. These sub-networks may be dynamic, i.e., they may appear, disappear, or even move throughout the network. Moreover, sub-networks may operate within a shared frequency spectrum, thereby requiring coordination among them. We demonstrate the concept of Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) for future 6G networks that dynamically (re-)allocates spectrum according to active sub-networks in the shared spectrum domain. Resilient control plane connectivity between sub-networks and the DSM is provided by the self-organizing routing protocol KIRA, enabling the aforementioned coordination. This demonstration presents an integrated solution of the DSM concept, providing increased flexibility to support diverse industrial applications and their individual performance requirements simultaneously within the context of a cyber-physical production system (CPPS). For the sub-networks, we use specifically designed hardware for wireless real-time communication and couple them with a network emulation. By switching sub-networks on and off, one can see that the DSM dynamically manages the spectrum allocations for them and that KIRA provides the required connectivity.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Based Modelling and Analysis of Uplink Cooperative Satellite-Aerial-Terrestrial Networks for Nomadic Communications with Weak Satellite Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative satellite-aerial-terrestrial networks (CSATNs), where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are utilized as nomadic aerial relays (A), are highly valuable for many important applications, such as post-disaster urban reconstruction. In this scenario, direct communication between terrestrial terminals (T) and satellites (S) is often unavailable due to poor propagation conditions for satellite signals, and users tend to congregate in regions of finite size. There is a current dearth in the open literature regarding the uplink performance analysis of CSATN operating under the above constraints, and the few contributions on the uplink model terrestrial terminals by a Poisson point process (PPP) relying on the unrealistic assumption of an infinite area. This paper aims to fill the above research gap. First, we propose a stochastic geometry based innovative model to characterize the impact of the finite-size distribution region of terrestrial terminals in the CSATN by jointly using a binomial point process (BPP) and a type-II Mat{\'e}rn hard-core point process (MHCPP). Then, we analyze the relationship between the spatial distribution of the coverage areas of aerial nodes and the finite-size distribution region of terrestrial terminals, thereby deriving the distance distribution of the T-A links. Furthermore, we consider the stochastic nature of the spatial distributions of terrestrial terminals and UAVs, and conduct a thorough analysis of the coverage probability and average ergodic rate of the T-A links under Nakagami fading and the A-S links under shadowed-Rician fading. Finally, the accuracy of our theoretical derivations are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. Our research offers fundamental insights into the system-level performance optimization for the realistic CSATNs involving nomadic aerial relays and terrestrial terminals confined in a finite-size region.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Federated Self-Supervised Learning for Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in ISAC-Enabled Vehicle Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) leverage Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) to enhance data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). This integration inevitably increases computing demands, risking real-time system stability. Vehicle Edge Computing (VEC) addresses this by offloading tasks to Road Side Unit (RSU), ensuring timely services. Our previous work FLSimCo algorithm, which uses local resources for Federated Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), though vehicles often can't complete all iterations task. Our improved algorithm offloads partial task to RSU and optimizes energy consumption by adjusting transmission power, CPU frequency, and task assignment ratios, balancing local and RSU-based training. Meanwhile, setting an offloading threshold further prevents inefficiencies. Simulation results show that the enhanced algorithm reduces energy consumption, improves offloading efficiency and the accuracy of Federated SSL.</description>

      <title>Effective Anonymous Messaging: the Role of Altruism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anonymous messaging and payments have gained momentum recently due to their impact on individuals, society, and the digital landscape. Fuzzy Message Detection (FMD) is a privacy-preserving protocol where an untrusted server performs message anonymously filtering for its clients. To prevent the server from linking the sender and the receiver, the latter can set how much cover traffic they should download along with genuine messages. This could cause unwanted messages to appear on the user's end, thereby creating a need to balance one's bandwidth cost with the desired level of unlinkability. Previous work showed that FMD is not viable with selfish users. In this paper, we model and analyze FMD using the tools of empirical game theory and show that the system needs at least a few altruistic users to operate properly. Utilizing real-world communication datasets, we characterize the emerging equilibria, quantify the impact of different types and levels of altruism, and assess the efficiency of potential outcomes versus socially optimal allocations. Moreover, taking a mechanism design approach, we show how the betweenness centrality (BC) measure can be utilized to achieve the social optimum.</description>

      <title>SLA Conceptual Model for IoT Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since SLAs specify the contractual terms that are formally used between consumers and providers, there is a need to aggregate QoS requirements from the perspectives of Clouds, networks, and devices to deliver the promised IoT functionalities. Therefore, the main objective of this chapter is to provide a conceptual model of SLA for the IoT as well as rich vocabularies to describe the QoS and domain-specific configuration parameters of the IoT on an end-to-end basis. We first propose a conceptual model that identifies the main concepts that play a role in specifying end-to-end SLAs. Then, we identify some of the most common QoS metrics and configuration parameters related to each concept. We evaluated the proposed conceptual model using a goal-oriented approach, and the participants in the study reported a high level of satisfaction regarding the proposed conceptual model and its ability to capture main concepts in a general way.</description>

      <title>IoT Monitoring with Blockchain: Generating Smart Contracts from Service Level Agreements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a client and provider that assures the quality of service (QoS) a client can expect to receive when purchasing a service. However, evidence of SLA violations in Internet of Things (IoT) service monitoring data can be manipulated by the provider or consumer, resulting in an issue of trust between contracted parties. The following research aims to explore the use of blockchain technology in monitoring IoT systems using smart contracts so that SLA violations captured are irrefutable amongst service providers and clients. The research focuses on the development of a Java library that is capable of generating a smart contract from a given SLA. A smart contract generated by this library is validated through a mock scenario presented in the form of a Remote Patient Monitoring IoT system. In this scenario, the findings demonstrate a 100 percent success rate in capturing all emulated violations.</description>

      <title>European Quantum Ecosystems -- Preparing the Industry for the Quantum Security and Communications Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that a second quantum revolution based on the technological capabilities to detect and manipulate single quantum particles (e.g., electrons, photons, ions, etc), a feat not achieved during the first quantum revolution, is progressing fast. It is expected that in less than 10 years, this second quantum revolution shall have a significant impact over numerous industries, including finance, medicine, energy, transportation, etc. Quantum computers threaten the status quo of cybersecurity, due to known quantum algorithms that can break asymmetric encryption, which is what gives us the ability to communicate securely using a public channel. Considering the world's dependence on digital communication through data exchange and processing, retaining the ability to communicate securely even once quantum computers come into play, cannot be stressed enough. Two solutions are available: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC); which, we emphasise, are not mutually exclusive. The EuroQCI initiative, of which EQUO is a part of, focuses on QKD and aims to build a network whereby EU countries can communicate securely through QKD. To this aim, the DEP (Digital Europe Programme) project aims to bring technological matureness to QKD by deploying a QKD test network and, through this exercise, understand what is lacking from an operator's point of view when the time to integrate QKD in their network comes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01672v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless technology is seen as one of the enablers of real-time fusion of the physical and digital realms, as in Digital Twin, eXtended reality, or the Metaverse. This would allow people to interact, work, and entertain themselves in an immersive social network of online 3D~virtual environments. From the viewpoint of communication and networking, this will represent an evolution of the \emph{game networking} technology, designed to interconnect massive users in real-time online gaming environments. This article presents the basic principles of game networking and discusses their evolution towards meeting the requirements of the Metaverse and similar applications. Several open research challenges are discussed, along with possible solutions through experimental case studies.</description>

      <title>Resource Placement for Rate and Fidelity Maximization in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing classical optical network infrastructure cannot be immediately used for quantum network applications due to photon loss. The first step towards enabling quantum networks is the integration of quantum repeaters into optical networks. However, the expenses and intrinsic noise inherent in quantum hardware underscore the need for an efficient deployment strategy that optimizes the allocation of quantum repeaters and memories. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for network planning, aiming to efficiently distributing quantum repeaters across existing infrastructure, with the objective of maximizing quantum network utility within an entanglement distribution network. We apply our framework to several cases including a preliminary illustration of a dumbbell network topology and real-world cases of the SURFnet and ESnet. We explore the effect of quantum memory multiplexing within quantum repeaters, as well as the influence of memory coherence time on quantum network utility. We further examine the effects of different fairness assumptions on network planning, uncovering their impacts on real-time network performance.</description>
