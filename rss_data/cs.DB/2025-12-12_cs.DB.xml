      <title>PANDAExpress: a Simpler and Faster PANDA Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PANDA is a powerful generic algorithm for answering conjunctive queries (CQs) and disjunctive datalog rules (DDRs) given input degree constraints. In the special case where degree constraints are cardinality constraints and the query is Boolean, PANDA runs in $\tilde O (N^{subw})$-time, where $N$ is the input size, and $subw$ is the submodular width of the query, a notion introduced by Daniel Marx (JACM 2013). When specialized to certain classes of sub-graph pattern finding problems, the $\tilde O(N^{subw})$ runtime matches the optimal runtime possible, modulo some conjectures in fine-grained complexity (Bringmann and Gorbachev (STOC 25)). The PANDA framework is much more general, as it handles arbitrary input degree constraints, which capture common statistics and integrity constraints used in relational database management systems, it works for queries with free variables, and for both CQs and DDRs.
  The key weakness of PANDA is the large $polylog(N)$-factor hidden in the $\tilde O(\cdot)$ notation. This makes PANDA completely impractical, and fall short of what is achievable with specialized algorithms. This paper resolves this weakness with two novel ideas. First, we prove a new probabilistic inequality that upper-bounds the output size of DDRs under arbitrary degree constraints. Second, the proof of this inequality directly leads to a new algorithm named PANDAExpress that is both simpler and faster than PANDA. The novel feature of PANDAExpress is a new partitioning scheme that uses arbitrary hyperplane cuts instead of axis-parallel hyperplanes used in PANDA. These hyperplanes are dynamically constructed based on data-skewness statistics carefully tracked throughout the algorithm's execution. As a result, PANDAExpress removes the $polylog(N)$-factor from the runtime of PANDA, matching the runtimes of intricate specialized algorithms, while retaining all its generality and power.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hypergraph Pattern Matching via Match-and-Filter and Intersection Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph, in which a hyperedge can connect multiple vertices, modeling complex relationships involving multiple vertices simultaneously. Hypergraph pattern matching, which is to find all isomorphic embeddings of a query hypergraph in a data hypergraph, is one of the fundamental problems. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for hypergraph pattern matching by introducing (1) the intersection constraint, a necessary and sufficient condition for valid embeddings, which significantly speeds up the verification process, (2) the candidate hyperedge space, a data structure that stores potential mappings between hyperedges in the query hypergraph and the data hypergraph, and (3) the Match-and-Filter framework, which interleaves matching and filtering operations to maintain only compatible candidates in the candidate hyperedge space during backtracking. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms, by up to orders of magnitude in terms of query processing time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Defective Clique Enumeration and Search with Worst-Case Optimal Search Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-defective clique is a relaxation of the traditional clique definition, allowing up to $k$ missing edges. This relaxation is crucial in various real-world applications such as link prediction, community detection, and social network analysis. Although the problems of enumerating maximal $k$-defective cliques and searching a maximum $k$-defective clique have been extensively studied, existing algorithms suffer from limitations such as the combinatorial explosion of small partial solutions and sub-optimal search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose a novel clique-first branch-and-bound framework that first generates cliques and then adds missing edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new pivoting technique that achieves a search space size of $\mathcal{O}(3^{\frac{n}{3}} \cdot n^k)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. We prove that the worst-case number of maximal $k$-defective cliques is $\Omega(3^{\frac{n}{3}} \cdot n^k)$ when $k$ is a constant, establishing that our algorithm's search space is worst-case optimal. Leveraging the diameter-two property of defective cliques, we further reduce the search space size to $\mathcal{O}(n \cdot 3^{\frac{\delta}{3}} \cdot (\delta \Delta)^k)$, where $\delta$ is the degeneracy and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also propose an efficient framework for maximum $k$-defective clique search based on our branch-and-bound, together with practical techniques to reduce the search space. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets with more than 1 million edges demonstrate that each of our proposed algorithms for maximal $k$-defective clique enumeration and maximum $k$-defective clique search outperforms the respective state-of-the-art algorithms by up to four orders of magnitude in terms of processing time.</description>

      <title>IRG: Modular Synthetic Relational Database Generation with Complex Relational Schemas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely used by corporations and governments to store multiple related tables. Their relational schemas pose unique challenges to synthetic data generation for privacy-preserving data sharing, e.g., for collaborative analytical and data mining tasks, as well as software testing at various scales. Relational schemas typically include a set of primary and foreign key constraints to specify the intra-and inter-table entity relations, which also imply crucial intra-and inter-table data correlations in the RDBs. Existing synthetic RDB generation approaches often focus on the relatively simple and basic parent-child relations, failing to address the ubiquitous real-world complexities in relational schemas in key constraints like composite keys, intra-table correlations like sequential correlation, and inter-table data correlations like indirectly connected tables. In this paper, we introduce incremental relational generator (IRG), a modular framework designed to handle these real-world challenges. In IRG, each table is generated by learning context from a depth-first traversal of relational connections to capture indirect inter-table relationships and constructs different parts of a table through several classical generative and predictive modules to preserve complex key constraints and data correlations. Compared to 3 prior art algorithms across 10 real-world RDB datasets, IRG successfully handles the relational schemas and captures critical data relationships for all datasets while prior works are incapable of. The generated synthetic data also demonstrates better fidelity and utility than prior works, implying its higher potential as a replacement for the basis of analytical tasks and data mining applications.

      <title>Elastic Index Selection for Label-Hybrid AKNN Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world vector embeddings are usually associated with extra labels, such as attributes and keywords. Many applications require the nearest neighbor search that contains specific labels, such as searching for product image embeddings restricted to a particular brand. A straightforward approach is to materialize all possible indices according to the complete query label workload. However, this leads to an exponential increase in both index space and processing time, which significantly limits scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we leverage the inclusion relationships among query label sets to construct partial indexes, enabling index sharing across queries for improved construction efficiency. We introduce \textit{elastic factor} bounds to guarantee search performance and use the greedy algorithm to select indices that meet the bounds, achieving a tradeoff between efficiency and space. Meanwhile, we also designed the algorithm to achieve the best elastic factor under a given space limitation. Experimental results on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve near-optimal search performance, achieving up to 10x-500x search efficiency speed up over state-of-the-art approaches. Our algorithm is highly versatile, since it is not constrained by index type and can seamlessly integrate with existing optimized libraries.</description>

      <title>Exqutor: Extended Query Optimizer for Vector-augmented Analytical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector similarity search is becoming increasingly important for data science pipelines, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where it enhances large language model inference by enabling efficient retrieval of relevant external knowledge. As RAG expands with table-augmented generation to incorporate structured data, workloads integrating table and vector search are becoming more prevalent. However, efficiently executing such queries remains challenging due to inaccurate cardinality estimation for vector search components, leading to suboptimal query plans. In this paper, we propose Exqutor, an extended query optimizer for vector-augmented analytical queries. Exqutor is a pluggable cardinality estimation framework designed to address this issue, leveraging exact cardinality query optimization techniques to enhance estimation accuracy when vector indexes (e.g., HNSW, IVF) are available. In scenarios lacking these indexes, we employ a sampling-based approach with adaptive sampling size adjustment, dynamically tuning the sample size to balance estimation accuracy and sampling overhead. This allows Exqutor to efficiently approximate vector search cardinalities while minimizing computational costs. We integrate our framework into pgvector, VBASE, and DuckDB, demonstrating performance improvements of up to four orders of magnitude on vector-augmented analytical queries.</description>
