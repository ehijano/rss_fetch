      <title>Network scaling and scale-driven loss balancing for intelligent poroelastography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning framework is developed for multiscale characterization of poroelastic media from full waveform data which is known as poroelastography. Special attention is paid to heterogeneous environments whose multiphase properties may drastically change across several scales. Described in space-frequency, the data takes the form of focal solid displacement and pore pressure fields in various neighborhoods furnished either by reconstruction from remote data or direct measurements depending on the application. The objective is to simultaneously recover the six hydromechanical properties germane to Biot equations and their spatial distribution in a robust and efficient manner. Two major challenges impede direct application of existing state-of-the-art techniques for this purpose: (i) the sought-for properties belong to vastly different and potentially uncertain scales, and~(ii) the loss function is multi-objective and multi-scale (both in terms of its individual components and the total loss). To help bridge the gap, we propose the idea of \emph{network scaling} where the neural property maps are constructed by unit shape functions composed into a scaling layer. In this model, the unknown network parameters (weights and biases) remain of O(1) during training. This forms the basis for explicit scaling of the loss components and their derivatives with respect to the network parameters. Thereby, we propose the physics-based \emph{dynamic scaling} approach for adaptive loss balancing. The idea is first presented in a generic form for multi-physics and multi-scale PDE systems, and then applied through a set of numerical experiments to poroelastography. The results are presented along with reconstructions by way of gradient normalization (GradNorm) and Softmax adaptive weights (SoftAdapt) for loss balancing. A comparative analysis of the methods and corresponding results is provided.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CKM Construction with Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a novel technique for achieving environment awareness, and thereby improving the communication and sensing performance for wireless systems. A fundamental problem associated with CKM is how to construct a complete CKM that provides channel knowledge for a large number of locations based solely on sparse data measurements. This problem bears similarities to the super-resolution (SR) problem in image processing. In this letter, we propose an effective deep learning-based CKM construction method that leverages the image SR network known as SRResNet. Unlike most existing studies, our approach does not require any additional input beyond the sparsely measured data. In addition to the conventional path loss map construction, our approach can also be applied to construct channel angle maps (CAMs), thanks to the use of a new dataset called CKMImageNet. The numerical results demonstrate that our method outperforms interpolation-based methods such as nearest neighbour and bicubic interpolation, as well as the SRGAN method in CKM construction. Furthermore, only 1/16 of the locations need to be measured in order to achieve a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 dB in path loss.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk in Inductive Coupling Communications for Multi-Stacked Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper simulates and analyses the crosstalk interference in off-chip and on-chip communications in multi-stacked chips where Inductive Coupling Links (ICLs) are the communication medium. Crosstalk impacts data signals, leading to errors in the receiver when adjacent transmitters communicate simultaneously. We explored techniques to reduce crosstalk, including varying the coil geometry, changing the coil arrays, and using time-interleaving multiplexing. We propose a 1-of-4 technique, where two bits of data are coded into four bits, always including a '1'. Using an electromagnetic simulator, we described crosstalk behaviour and applied the results to Matlab Simulink to obtain bit-error rates (BER). Simulation results showed that the interference-to-signal ratio (ISR) decreased gradually with increased horizontal coil separation. Additionally, we observed that changing the layout arrays for the coils plays a vital role in reducing crosstalk. The 4-phase time interleaving multiplexing and 1-of-4 technique significantly reduced crosstalk at the expense of bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Demand-Aware Beam Hopping and Power Allocation for Load Balancing in Digital Twin empowered LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites utilizing beam hopping (BH) technology offer extensive coverage, low latency, high bandwidth, and significant flexibility. However, the uneven geographical distribution and temporal variability of ground traffic demands, combined with the high mobility of LEO satellites, present significant challenges for efficient beam resource utilization. Traditional BH methods based on GEO satellites fail to address issues such as satellite interference, overlapping coverage, and mobility. This paper explores a Digital Twin (DT)-based collaborative resource allocation network for multiple LEO satellites with overlapping coverage areas. A two-tier optimization problem, focusing on load balancing and cell service fairness, is proposed to maximize throughput and minimize inter-cell service delay. The DT layer optimizes the allocation of overlapping coverage cells by designing BH patterns for each satellite, while the LEO layer optimizes power allocation for each selected service cell. At the DT layer, an Actor-Critic network is deployed on each agent, with a global critic network in the cloud center. The A3C algorithm is employed to optimize the DT layer. Concurrently, the LEO layer optimization is performed using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm, where each beam functions as an independent agent. The simulation results show that this method reduces satellite load disparity by about 72.5% and decreases the average delay to 12ms. Additionally, our approach outperforms other benchmarks in terms of throughput, ensuring a better alignment between offered and requested data.</description>

      <title>Respiro: Continuous Respiratory Rate Monitoring During Motion via Wearable Ultra-Wideband Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deviations in respiratory rate often precede abnormalities in other vital signs. However, continuously monitoring respiratory rates outside clinical settings remains challenging due to the obtrusive nature and sensitivity to body motions in existing monitoring approaches. In this study, we propose a single-point-of-contact wearable device that leverages off-the-shelf, consumer-grade ultra-wideband radar to monitor respiratory rate as part of a chest strap. Our signal processing pipeline reliably extracts the wearer's respiratory signal from windowed complex channel impulse responses. In a controlled experiment, twelve participants performed various activities to evaluate the system's accuracy under motion while capturing ground-truth recordings through a spirometer. Our method extracted respiratory rates with less than 1 breath per minute deviation in 71% of all measurements, averaging 1.11 breaths per minute across all sessions and participants. Our findings underscore the potential of consumer-grade ultra-wideband radar technology in body-worn devices for unobtrusive yet effective respiratory monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Range-Free Node Localization Method for Anisotropic Wireless Sensor Networks with Sparse Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sensor networks characterized by irregular layouts and poor connectivity, anisotropic properties can significantly reduce the accuracy of distance estimation between nodes, consequently impairing the localization precision of unidentified nodes. Since distance estimation is contingent upon the multi-hop paths between anchor node pairs, assigning differential weights based on the reliability of these paths could enhance localization accuracy. To address this, we introduce an adaptive weighted method, termed AW-MinMax, for range-free node localization. This method involves constructing a weighted mean nodes localization model, where each multi-hop path weight is inversely proportional to the number of hops. Despite the model's inherent non-convexity and non-differentiability, it can be reformulated into an optimization model with convex objective functions and non-convex constraints through matrix transformations. To resolve these constraints, we employ a Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) algorithm that utilizes first-order Taylor expansion for iterative refinement. Simulation results validate that our proposed algorithm substantially improves stability and accuracy in estimating range-free node locations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix of Antenna: Moment Solution, Compression Storage and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for computing the generalized scattering matrix (GSM) of antennas using the method of moments (MoM), circumventing many of the constraints associated with finite element methods (FEM). We also propose an effective storage scheme for the GSM, significantly reducing the storage burden for problems involving multiple frequency sampling points. Numerical results validate the correctness of our formulations. Moreover, we provide a practical example of using the GSM to analyze the coupling effects between elements of an antenna array. This approach allows for the independent consideration of the array and its individual elements, showcasing the substantial advantages of GSM. These examples underscore the potential of GSM to enhance antenna design and analysis, particularly in complex configurations.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning based Hybrid Receiver for 5G NR PRACH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Access is a critical procedure using which a User Equipment (UE) identifies itself to a Base Station (BS). Random Access starts with the UE transmitting a random preamble on the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH). In a conventional BS receiver, the UE's specific preamble is identified by correlation with all the possible preambles. The PRACH signal is also used to estimate the timing advance which is induced by propagation delay. Correlation-based receivers suffer from false peaks and missed detection in scenarios dominated by high fading and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper describes the design of a hybrid receiver that consists of an AI/ML model for preamble detection followed by conventional peak detection for the Timing Advance estimation. The proposed receiver combines the Power Delay Profiles of correlation windows across multiple antennas and uses the combination as input to a Neural Network model. The model predicts the presence or absence of a user in a particular preamble window, after which the timing advance is estimated by peak detection. Results show superior performance of the hybrid receiver compared to conventional receivers both for simulated and real hardware-captured datasets.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Beamforming in Multi-User Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A DeepCAPA (Deep Learning for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)) framework is proposed to learn beamforming in CAPA systems. The beamforming optimization problem is firstly formulated, and it is mathematically proved that the optimal beamforming lies in the subspace spanned by users' conjugate channel responses. Two challenges are encountered when directly applying deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving the formulated problem, i) both the input and output spaces are infinite-dimensional, which are not compatible with DNNs. The finite-dimensional representations of inputs and outputs are derived to address this challenge. ii) A closed-form loss function is unavailable for training the DNN. To tackle this challenge, two additional DNNs are trained to approximate the operations without closed-form expressions for expediting gradient back-propagation. To improve learning performance and reduce training complexity, the permutation equivariance properties of the mappings to be learned are mathematically proved. As a further advance, the DNNs are designed as graph neural networks to leverage the properties. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed DeepCAPA framework achieves higher spectral efficiency and lower inference complexity compared to match-filtering and state-of-art Fourier-based discretization method, and ii) DeepCAPA approaches the performance upper bound of optimizing beamforming in the spatially discrete array-based system as the number of antennas in a fixed-sized area tends toward infinity.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of Multiple-STAR-RIS Assisted MIMO-NOMA with GSVD Precoding: An Operator-Valued Free Probability Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the key enabling 6G techniques, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) play an important role in enhancing the spectral efficiency of the wireless communication systems. To further extend the coverage and the capacity, the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has recently emerged out as a cost-effective technology. To exploit the benefit of STAR-RIS in the MIMO-NOMA systems, in this paper, we investigate the analysis and optimization of the downlink dual-user MIMO-NOMA systems assisted by multiple STAR-RISs under the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) precoding scheme, in which the channel is assumed to be Rician faded with the Weichselberger's correlation structure. To analyze the asymptotic information rate of the users, we apply the operator-valued free probability theory to obtain the Cauchy transform of the generalized singular values (GSVs) of the MIMO-NOMA channel matrices, which can be used to obtain the information rate by Riemann integral. Then, considering the special case when the channels between the BS and the STAR-RISs are deterministic, we obtain the closed-form expression for the asymptotic information rates of the users. Furthermore, a projected gradient ascent method (PGAM) is proposed with the derived closed-form expression to design the STAR-RISs thereby maximizing the sum rate based on the statistical channel state information. The numerical results show the accuracy of the asymptotic expression compared to the Monte Carlo simulations and the superiority of the proposed PGAM algorithm.</description>

      <title>Performance Boundaries and Tradeoffs in Super-Resolution Imaging Technologies for Space Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) super-resolution imaging technology is widely applied in space target imaging. However, the performance limits of super-resolution imaging algorithms remain a rarely explored issue. This paper investigates these limits by analyzing the boundaries of super- resolution algorithms for space targets and examines the relationships between key contributing factors. In particular, drawing on the established mathematical theory of computational resolution limits (CRL) for line spectrum reconstruction, we derive mathematical expressions for the upper and lower bounds of cross-range super-resolution imaging, based on ISAR imaging model transformations. Leveraging the explicit expressions, we first explore influencing factors of these bounds, such as the traditional Rayleigh limit, the number of scatterers, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of scatterers. Then we elucidate the minimum resource requirements in ISAR imaging imposed by the CRL theory to meet the desired cross-range resolution, without which studying super-resolution algorithms becomes unnecessary in practice. Furthermore, the tradeoffs between the cumulative rotation angle, the radar transmit energy, and other contributing factors in optimizing the resolution are analyzed. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate these tradeoffs across various ISAR imaging scenarios, revealing their high dependence on specific imaging targets.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Linear Array based Product Beamforming for Real Time Underwater 3D Acoustical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean exploration using acoustical 3D imaging is gaining popularity as it provides information about the 3D geometry of the targets even under mild turbid conditions. A major challenge in underwater 3D imaging is the high cost of the planar arrays and the computational complexity of the image reconstruction algorithms. In this work, we introduce two novel aspects, an L shaped array and a quadrant based time domain receive beamforming with a focus on achieving relatively low computational complexity for real-time 3D imaging in underwater environments. An orthogonal combination of two linear arrays to form an L shape is used to perform two independent and parallel 2D delay and sum beamforming and the 3D image of the target is reconstructed using the product of the resulting beams. In the proposed quadrant-based beamforming, each quadrant in the imaging slice is reconstructed in parallel using the orthogonal L-shaped linear arrays which reside at the edges of the planar array for the quadrant to be reconstructed. The proposed L-array solves the multiple-target ambiguity issue of the cross-array and an L-array placed at the center of the uniform planar array. The proposed method has reduced the main lobe width by 1 degree with 11.8 dB increase in the peak side lobe level when compared to the conventional delay and sum beamforming using a uniform planar array. Although there is an increase in the side lobe level, the asymmetric beam pattern of the proposed L array and the quadrant-based beamforming restrict the side lobes within a quadrant. The proposed method achieves a reduction in computation time by a factor of 97 for 3D imaging compared to the conventional method, while maintaining acceptable image quality. For qualitative analysis, the 3D images of different underwater targets have been reconstructed and compared in simulation and experiment.</description>

      <title>FAS for Secure and Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter considers a fluid antenna system (FAS)-aided secure and covert communication system, where the transmitter adjusts multiple fluid antennas' positions to achieve secure and covert transmission under the threat of an eavesdropper and the detection of a warden. This letter aims to maximize the secrecy rate while satisfying the covertness constraint. Unfortunately, the optimization problem is non-convex due to the coupled variables. To tackle this, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternatively optimize the optimization variables in an iterative manner. In particular, we use a penalty-based method and the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to optimize the transmit beamforming and fluid antennas' positions, respectively. Simulation results show that FAS can significantly improve the performance of secrecy and covertness compared to the fixed-position antenna (FPA)-based schemes.</description>

      <title>Iterative tomographic reconstruction with TV prior for low-dose CBCT dental imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract Objective. Cone-beam computed tomography is becoming more and more popular in applications such as 3D dental imaging. Iterative methods compared to the standard Feldkamp algorithm have shown improvements in image quality of reconstruction of low-dose acquired data despite their long computing time. An interesting aspect of iterative methods is their ability to include prior information such as sparsity-constraint. While a large panel of optimization algorithms along with their adaptation to tomographic problems are available, they are mainly studied on 2D parallel or fan-beam data. The issues raised by 3D CBCT and moreover by truncated projections are still poorly understood. Approach. We compare different carefully designed optimization schemes in the context of realistic 3D dental imaging. Besides some known algorithms, SIRT-TV and MLEM, we investigate the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) approach and a newly proposed MLEM-TV optimizer. The last one is alternating EM steps and TV-denoising, combination not yet investigated for CBCT. Experiments are performed on both simulated data from a 3D jaw phantom and data acquired with a dental clinical scanner. Main results. With some adaptations to the specificities of CBCT operators, PDHG and MLEM-TV algorithms provide the best reconstruction quality. These results were obtained by comparing the full-dose image with a low-dose image and an ultra low-dose image. Significance. The convergence speed of the original iterative methods is hampered by the conical geometry and significantly reduced compared to parallel geometries. We promote the pre-conditioned version of PDHG and we propose a pre-conditioned version of the MLEM-TV algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time PDHG and convergent MLEM-TV algorithms are evaluated on experimental dental CBCT data, where constraints such as projection truncation and presence of metal have to be jointly overcome.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Framework for Grant-Free Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel generalized framework for grant-free random-access (GFRA) in cell-free massive multiple input multiple-output systems where multiple geographically separated access points (APs) or base stations (BSs) aim to detect sporadically active user-equipment (UEs). Unlike a conventional architecture in which all the active UEs transmit their signature or pilot sequences of equal length, we admit a flexible pilot length for each UE, which also enables a seamless integration into conventional grant-based wireless systems. We formulate the joint UE activity detection and the distributed channel estimation as a sparse support and signal recovery problem, and describe a Bayesian learning procedure to solve it. We develop a scheme to fuse the posterior statistics of the latent variables inferred by each AP to jointly detect the UEs' activities, and utilize them to further refine the channel estimates. In addition, we allude to an interesting point which enables this flexible GFRA framework to encode the information bits from the active UEs. We numerically evaluate the normalized mean square error and the probability of miss-detection performances obtained by the Bayesian algorithm and show that the latent-variable fusion enhances the detection and the channel estimation performances by a large margin. We also benchmark against a genie-aided algorithm which has a prior knowledge of the UEs' activities.</description>

      <title>Circuit-Compliant Optimization of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Near-Field Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for near-field localization with Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA) receivers. This metasurface technology offers enhanced angular and range resolution realizing efficient hybrid Analog and Digital (A/D) BeamForming (BF) with sub-wavelength-spaced metamaterials of tunable responses. However, the vast majority of the state-of-the-art DMA designs is based on an idealized model for their reception operation, which neglects several practical aspects, such as the inevitable mutual coupling among the densely deployed metamaterials within a given aperture. Capitalizing on a recent circuit-compliant active metasurface model, we present a novel mutual-coupling-aware framework for localization-optimized hybrid A/D BF weights at the reception DMA. To deal with the intrinsic complexity of the deployed model, we introduce first- and second-order approximations for the DMA analog BF matrix that enable efficient optimization, while maintaining accuracy. We derive the Cramer-Rao Bound for the user position estimation which serves as our design objective for the hybrid A/D BF matrices. Closed-form solutions for these matrices for both approximations are presented, whose validity is confirmed via numerical investigations. It is also demonstrated that the proposed DMA design outperforms state-of-the-art multi-antenna reception architectures optimized for the same localization objective.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Networked Full-Duplex Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) networks. Classical ISAC system considering monostatic and/or bistatic settings will inevitably degrade both communication and sensing performance due to the limited service coverage and easily blocked transmission paths. Besides, existing ISAC studies usually focus on downlink (DL) or uplink (UL) communication demands and unable to achieve the systematic DL and UL communication tasks. These challenges can be overcome by networked FD ISAC framework. Moreover, ISAC generally considers the trade-off between communication and sensing, unavoidably leading to a loss in communication performance. This shortcoming can be solved by the emerging movable antenna (MA) technology. In this paper, we utilize the MA to promote communication capability with guaranteed sensing performance via jointly designing beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters and MA configuration towards maximizing sum rate. The optimization problem is highly difficult due to the unique channel model deriving from the MA. To resolve this challenge, via leveraging the cutting-the-edge majorization-minimization (MM) method, we develop an efficient solution that optimizes all variables via convex optimization techniques. Extensive simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the substantial performance promotion by deploying MA in the networked FD ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Wearables: An Analysis of Low-Power Microcontrollers for Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breakthroughs in ultra-low-power chip technology are transforming biomedical wearables, making it possible to monitor patients in real time with devices operating on mere {\mu}W. Although many studies have examined the power performance of commercial microcontrollers, it remains unclear which ones perform best across diverse application profiles and which hardware features are most crucial for minimizing energy consumption under varying computational loads. Identifying these features for typical wearable applications and understanding their effects on performance and energy efficiency are essential for optimizing deployment strategies and informing future hardware designs. In this work, we conduct an in-depth study of state-of-the-art (SoA) micro-controller units(MCUs) in terms of processing capability and energy efficiency using representative end-to-end SoA wearable applications. We systematically benchmark each platform across three primary application phases: idle, data acquisition, and processing, allowing a holistic assessment of the platform processing capability and overall energy efficiency across varying patient-monitoring application profiles. Our detailed analysis of performance and energy discrepancies across different platforms reveals key strengths and limitations of the current low-power hardware design and pinpoints the strengths and weaknesses of SoA MCUs. We conclude with actionable insights for wearable application designers and hardware engineers, aiming to inform future hardware design improvements and support optimal platform selection for energy-constrained biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Assisted VLC MISO Networks with RSMA: A DS-PPO approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) visible light communication (VLC) networks utilizing the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme. {In these networks,} an eavesdropper (Eve) attempts to eavesdrop on communications intended for legitimate users (LUs). To enhance information security and energy efficiency simultaneously, we formulate a secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem. In the formulated problem, beamforming vectors, RSMA common rates, direct current (DC) bias, and IRS alignment matrices are jointly optimized subject to constraints on total power budget, quality of service (QoS) requirements, linear operating region of light emitting diodes (LEDs), and common information rate allocation. Due to the non-convex and NP-hard nature of the formulated problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dual-sampling proximal policy optimization (DS-PPO) approach. {The approach leverages} dual sample strategies and generalized advantage estimation (GAE). In addition, to further simplify the design, we adopt the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) as beamforming vectors in the action space. Simulation results show that the proposed DS-PPO approach outperforms traditional baseline approaches in terms of achievable SEE and significantly improves convergence speed compared to the original PPO approach. Moreover, implementing the RSMA scheme and IRS contributes to overall system performance, {achieving approximately $19.67\%$ improvement over traditional multiple access schemes and $25.74\%$ improvement over networks without IRS deployment.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Enabled ISAC Systems: Joint Rate Splitting and Beamforming Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system bolstered by a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). Within this system, a base station (BS) is equipped with communication and radar capabilities, enabling it to communicate with ground terminals (GTs) and concurrently probe for echo signals from a target of interest. Moreover, to manage interference and improve communication quality, the rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is incorporated into the system. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the received sensing echo signals is a measure of sensing performance. We formulate a joint optimization problem of common rates, transmit beamforming at the BS, and passive beamforming vectors of the STAR-RIS. The objective is to maximize sensing SINR while guaranteeing the communication rate requirements for each GT. We present an iterative algorithm to address the non-convex problem by invoking Dinkelbach's transform, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), majorization-minimization, and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) theories. Simulation results manifest that the performance of the studied ISAC network enhanced by the STAR-RIS and RSMA surpasses other benchmarks considerably. The results evidently indicate the superior performance improvement of the ISAC system with the proposed RSMA-based transmission strategy design and the dynamic optimization of both transmission and reflection beamforming at STAR-RIS.</description>

      <title>Noncontact Multi-Point Vital Sign Monitoring with mmWave MIMO Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-point vital sign monitoring is essential for providing detailed insights into physiological changes. Traditional single-sensor approaches are inadequate for capturing multi-point vibrations. Existing contact-based solutions, while addressing this need, can cause discomfort and skin allergies, whereas noncontact optical and acoustic methods are highly susceptible to light interference and environmental noise. In this paper, we aim to develop a non-contact, multi-point vital sign monitoring technique using MIMO radar, focused on physically differentiating and precisely measuring chest-wall surface vibrations at multiple points induced by cardiopulmonary mechanical activity. The primary challenges in developing such a technique involve developing algorithms to extract and separate entangled signals, as well as establishing a reliable method for validating detection accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiVital, a wireless system that leverages mmWave Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) radar for synchronous multi-point vital sign monitoring. It integrates two reference modalities: five-channel seismocardiography (SCG) sensors and a one-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) electrode, enabling comprehensive radar-based research and performance validation across multiple physiological metrics. Additionally, we have developed a multi-modal signal processing framework, consisting of a radar signal processing module, an SCG calibration module, and a spatial alignment scheme. To evaluate the radar signal processing module, we conducted mathematical derivation and simulation. The experimental results indicate that the noncontact MultiVital system achieves multi-point synchronous monitoring with high precision, highly consistent with the results from reference modalities.</description>

      <title>Transferable Adversarial Attacks against ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the extensive research and real-world applications of automatic speech recognition (ASR), ensuring the robustness of ASR models against minor input perturbations becomes a crucial consideration for maintaining their effectiveness in real-time scenarios. Previous explorations into ASR model robustness have predominantly revolved around evaluating accuracy on white-box settings with full access to ASR models. Nevertheless, full ASR model details are often not available in real-world applications. Therefore, evaluating the robustness of black-box ASR models is essential for a comprehensive understanding of ASR model resilience. In this regard, we thoroughly study the vulnerability of practical black-box attacks in cutting-edge ASR models and propose to employ two advanced time-domain-based transferable attacks alongside our differentiable feature extractor. We also propose a speech-aware gradient optimization approach (SAGO) for ASR, which forces mistranscription with minimal impact on human imperceptibility through voice activity detection rule and a speech-aware gradient-oriented optimizer. Our comprehensive experimental results reveal performance enhancements compared to baseline approaches across five models on two databases.</description>

      <title>BlueME: Robust Underwater Robot-to-Robot Communication Using Compact Magnetoelectric Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. To evaluate its performance, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference-- that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Speech Decoding: A Novel Approach Using Multi-Kernel Ensemble Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an ensemble learning framework for electroencephalogram-based overt speech classification, leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models with varying convolutional kernel sizes. The ensemble comprises three models with kernel sizes of 51, 101, and 201, effectively capturing multi-scale temporal features inherent in signals. This approach improves the robustness and accuracy of speech decoding by accommodating the rich temporal complexity of neural signals. The ensemble models work in conjunction with conditional autoencoders that refine the reconstructed signals and maximize the useful information for downstream classification tasks. The results indicate that the proposed ensemble-based approach significantly outperforms individual models and existing state-of-the-art techniques. These findings demonstrate the potential of ensemble methods in advancing brain signal decoding, offering new possibilities for non-verbal communication applications, particularly in brain-computer interface systems aimed at aiding individuals with speech impairments.</description>

Abstract: A Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can significantly enhance network positioning and mapping, acting as an additional anchor point in the reference system and improving signal strength and measurement diversity through the generation of favorable scattering conditions and virtual line-of-sight paths. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework aimed at user localization and scatterer position estimation in an indoor environment with multipath effects. Our approach leverages beam sweeping through codebook-based beamforming at an 1-bit RIS to scan the environment, applies signal component extraction mechanisms, and utilizes a super-resolution algorithm for angle-based positioning of both connected users and scatterers. To validate the system's effectiveness, accurate 3D ray tracing models are employed, ensuring the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>ISAC Super-Resolution Receiver via Lifted Atomic Norm Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an off-the-grid estimator for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, utilizing lifted atomic norm minimization (LANM). The key challenge in this scenario is that neither the transmit signals nor the radar-and-communication channels are known. We prove that LANM can simultaneously achieve localization of radar targets and decoding of communication symbols, when the number of observations is proportional to the degrees of freedom in the ISAC systems. Despite the inherent ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ the lifting technique to initially encode the transmit signals. Then, we leverage the atomic norm to promote the structured low-rankness for the ISAC channel. We utilize a dual technique to transform the LANM into an infinite-dimensional search over the signal domain. Subsequently, we use semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to implement the dual problem.
  We extend our approach to practical scenarios where received signals are contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and jamming signals. Furthermore, we derive the computational complexity of the proposed estimator and demonstrate that it is equivalent to the conventional pilot-aided ANM for estimating the channel parameters. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed LANM approach to estimate both communication data and target parameters with a performance comparable to traditional radar-only super-resolution techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new system model to evaluate the capacity and power consumption of multi-layer 6G networks utilising the upper mid-band (FR3). The model captures heteroge- neous 4G, 5G, and 6G deployments, analyzing their performance under different deployment strategies. Our results show that strategic 6G deployments, non-co-located with existing 5G sites, significantly enhance throughput, with median and peak user rates of 300 Mbps and exceeding 1 Gbps, respectively. We also emphasize the importance of priority-based cell reselection and beam configuration to fully leverage 6G capabilities. While 6G implementation increases power consumption by 33%, non-co- located deployments strike a balance between performance and power consumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the communication performance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dense urban environments, specifically in Benidorm, Spain. Through a comprehensive measurement campaign, we assessed key performance indicators (KPIs) relating to received signal strength and quality as well as rate across various locations, altitudes, operators, technologies, and frequencies, using different measurement equipment. The results highlight significant challenges, primarily due to the lack of planning for aerial coverage and interference, revealing that current cellular networks may fall short in supporting U-space communication needs. The paper calls for network upgrades to ensure reliable UAV operations in urban airspace, contributing to the integration of UAVS in urban logistics and mobility.</description>

      <title>Broadened-beam Uniform Rectangular Array Coefficient Design in LEO SatComs Under Quality of Service and Constant Modulus Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite communications (SatComs) are expected to provide global Internet access. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (SATs) have the advantage of providing a higher downlink capacity due to their smaller link budget compared with medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) SATs. In this paper, beam broadening methods for uniform rectangular arrays (URAs) in LEO SatComs were studied. The proposed method is the first of its kind that jointly considers path loss variation from SAT to user terminal (UT) due to the Earth's curvature to guarantee the quality of service (QoS), constant modulus constraints (CMCs) favored for maximizing power amplifier (PA) efficiency, and out-of-beam radiation suppression to avoid interference. A broadened-beam URA coefficient design problem is formulated and decomposed into two uniform linear array (ULA) design subproblems utilizing Kronecker product beamforming. With this decomposition, the number of beamforming coefficients that need to be optimized is significantly reduced compared to the original URA design problem. The non-convex ULA subproblems are addressed using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and a convex iterative algorithm. Simulation results reveal the advantages of the proposed method for suppressing the out-of-beam radiation and achieving the design criteria. In addition, channel capacity evaluations are carried out. It demonstrates that the proposed "broadened-beam" beamformers can offer capacities that are at least four times greater than those of beamformers employing an array steering vector when the beam transition time is considered. The proposed method holds potential for LEO SAT broadcasting applications, such as digital video broadcasting (DVB).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel single-channel decomposition approach to facilitate the decomposition of electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded with limited channels. Our model posits that an EEG signal comprises short, shift-invariant waves, referred to as atoms. We design a decomposer as an artificial neural network aimed at estimating these atoms and detecting their time shifts and amplitude modulations within the input signal. The efficacy of our method was validated across various scenarios in brain--computer interfaces and neuroscience, demonstrating enhanced performance. Additionally, cross-dataset validation indicates the feasibility of a pre-trained model, enabling a plug-and-play signal decomposition module.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Class Transitions on the Design of Pattern Recognition-based Myoelectric Control Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite continued efforts to improve classification accuracy, it has been reported that offline accuracy is a poor indicator of the usability of pattern recognition-based myoelectric control. One potential source of this disparity is the existence of transitions between contraction classes that happen during regular use and are reported to be problematic for pattern recognition systems. Nevertheless, these transitions are often ignored or undefined during both the training and testing processes. In this work, we propose a set of metrics for analyzing the transitions that occur during the voluntary changes between contraction classes during continuous control. These metrics quantify the common types of errors that occur during transitions and compare them to existing metrics that apply only to the steady-state portions of the data. We then use these metrics to analyze transition characteristics of 6 commonly used classifiers on a novel dataset that includes continuous transitions between all combinations of seven different contraction classes. Results show that a linear discriminant classifier consistently outperforms other conventional classifiers during both transitions and steady-state conditions, despite having an almost identical offline performance. Results also show that, although offline training metrics correlate with steady-state performance, they do not correlate with transition performance. These insights suggest that the proposed set of metrics could provide a shift in perspective on the way pattern recognition systems are evaluated and provide a more representative picture of a classifier's performance, potentially narrowing the gap between offline performance and online usability.</description>

      <title>BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+: A GBSM-Based ISAC Standard Channel Model Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as the key technology in the vision of the sixth generation (6G) era. With the emergence of new concepts in mobile communications, the channel model is the prerequisite for system design and performance evaluation. Currently, 3GPP Release 19 is advancing the standardization of ISAC channel models. Nevertheless, a unified modeling framework has yet to be established. This paper provides a simulation diagram of ISAC channel modeling extended based on the Geometry-Based Stochastic Model (GBSM), which is compatible with existing 5G channel models and the latest progress in 3GPP standardization. We first introduce the progress of the ISAC channel model standard in general. Then a concatenation channel modeling approach considering team standardization proposals is presented which is implemented on the BUPTCMCC-6G-CMG+ channel model generator. We validated the model in cumulative probability density function (CDF) in statistical extension of angle and delay, and radar cross section (RCS). Simulation results show that the proposed model can realistically characterize the feature of concatenation and RCS within the ISAC channel. At the same time, the proposed method maintains an efficient simulation.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs) constitute a new paradigm of truly smart metasurfaces with the additional features of signal reception and processing, which have been primarily considered for channel estimation and self-reconfiguration. In this paper, leveraging the simultaneous tunable reflection and signal absorption functionality of HRIS elements, we present a novel framework for the joint design of transmit beamforming and the HRIS parameters with the goal to maximize downlink communications, while simultaneously illuminating an area of interest for guaranteed localization coverage performance. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and showcase the interplay of the various system parameters on the achievable Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) performance.</description>

      <title>Beam Tracking for Full-Duplex User Terminals in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel beam tracking scheme for full-duplex ground user terminals aiming to transmit uplink and receive downlink from two low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites at the same time and same frequency. Our proposed technique leverages observed phenomena from a recent measurement campaign to strategically select transmit and receive beams which couple low self-interference across the satellites' trajectories, thereby enabling in-band full-duplex operation. Our scheme takes a measurement-driven approach, meaning it does not rely on explicit knowledge of the self-interference channel and can inherently account for hardware impairments or other nonidealities. We show that our proposed scheme reliably selects beams which spatially cancel self-interference to below the noise floor, circumventing the need for digital/analog cancellation. Simulation results using satellite and orbital parameters published in 3GPP and FCC filings show that this substantial reduction in self-interference does not prohibitively compromise beamforming gain, allowing the user terminal to attain near-maximal SINRs, thus unlocking full-duplex operation.</description>

      <title>Performance of Linear Receive Beamforming for Continuous Aperture Arrays (CAPAs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of linear receive beamforming in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based uplink communications is analyzed. Continuous linear beamforming techniques are proposed for CAPA receivers under the criteria of maximum-ratio combining (MRC), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-square error (MMSE). i) For MRC beamforming, a closed-form expression for the beamformer is derived to maximize per-user signal power, and the achieved uplink rate and mean-square error (MSE) in detecting received data symbols are analyzed. ii) For ZF beamforming, a closed-form beamformer is derived using channel correlation to eliminate interference, with a function space interpretation demonstrating its optimality in maximizing signal power while ensuring zero inter-user interference. iii) For MMSE beamforming, it is proven to be the optimal linear receive approach for CAPAs in terms of maximizing per-user rate and minimizing MSE. A closed-form expression for the MMSE beamformer is then derived, along with the achievable sum-rate and sum-MSE. The proposed linear beamforming techniques are then compared with those for conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). Analytical and numerical results indicate that: i) for both CAPAs and SPDAs, the considered linear beamformers can be represented as weighted sums of each user's spatial response, with weights determined by channel correlation; ii) CAPAs achieve higher sum-rates and lower sum-MSEs than SPDAs under ZF and MMSE beamforming; and iii) SPDAs may outperform CAPAs with MRC beamforming in interference-dominated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming Optimization for Active STAR-RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, where the dual-function base station (DFBS) operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to provide communication services and performs targets sensing simultaneously. Meanwhile, we consider multiple targets and multiple users scenario as well as the self-interference at the FD DFBS. Through jointly optimizing the DFBS and active STAR-RIS beamforming under different work modes, our purpose is to achieve the maximum communication sum-rate, while satisfying the minimum radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint, the active STAR-RIS hardware constraints and the total power constraint of DFBS and active STAR-RIS. To tackle the complex non-convex optimization problem formulated, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the fractional programming method is first leveraged to turn the original problem into a more tractable one, and subsequently the transformed problem is decomposed into several sub-problems. Next, we develop a derivation method to obtain the closed-form expression of the radar receiving beamforming, and then the DFBS transmit beamforming is optimized under the radar SINR requirement and total power constraints. After that, the active STAR-RIS reflection and transmission beamforming are optimized by majorization minimization, complex circle manifold and convex optimization techniques. Finally, the proposed schemes are conducted through numerical simulations to show their benefits and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Finite-Precision Arithmetic Transceiver for Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13442v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.</description>

      <title>CSI Transfer From Sub-6G to mmWave: Reduced-Overhead Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid beamforming is vital in modern wireless systems, especially for massive MIMO and millimeter-wave (mmWave) deployments, offering efficient directional transmission with reduced hardware complexity. However, effective beamforming in multi-user scenarios relies heavily on accurate channel state information, the acquisition of which often requires significant pilot overhead, degrading system performance. To address this and inspired by the spatial congruence between sub-6GHz (sub-6G) and mmWave channels, we propose a Sub-6G information Aided Multi-User Hybrid Beamforming (SA-MUHBF) framework, avoiding excessive use of pilots at mmWave. SA-MUHBF employs a convolutional neural network to predict mmWave beamspace from sub-6G channel estimate, followed by a novel multi-layer graph neural network for analog beam selection and a linear minimum mean-square error algorithm for digital beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that SA-MUHBF efficiently predicts the mmWave beamspace representation and achieves superior spectrum efficiency over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Moreover, SA-MUHBF demonstrates robust performance across varied sub-6G system configurations and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and characterize the operational diversity order (ODO) in fading channels, as a proxy to the classical notion of diversity order at any arbitrary operational signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Thanks to this definition, relevant insights are brought up in a number of cases: (i) We quantify that in dominant line-of-sight scenarios an increased diversity order is attainable compared to that achieved asymptotically, even in the single-antenna case; (ii) this effect is attenuated, but still visible, in the presence of an additional dominant specular component; (iii) the decay slope in Rayleigh product channels increases very slowly, never fully achieving unitary slope for a finite SNR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed significant challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily accessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in existing wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot transmission. Based on the estimates of channel autocorrelation matrix, the passive reflection of IRS is optimized to maximize the average user received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers in the OFDM system. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing powermeasurement-based IRS reflection designs in wideband channels.</description>

Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are vital for environmental monitoring due to their high temperature sensitivity, but their complex data poses challeng-es for predictive models. This study introduces Prion-ViT, a prion-inspired Vision Transformer model, inspired by biological prion memory mecha-nisms, to improve long-term dependency modeling and temperature prediction accuracy using FSS data. Prion-ViT leverages a persistent memory state to retain and propagate key features across layers, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to 0.52{\deg}C and outperforming models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and standard vision transformers. This work highlights Prion-ViT's potential for real-time industrial temperature monitoring and broader optical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation of each antenna by adjusting its declination angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the declination angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal declination angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the declination angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is regarded as a crucial and powerful physical layer (PHY) paradigm for next-generation communication systems. Particularly, users employ successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode part of the interference while treating the remainder as noise. However, conventional RSMA systems rely on fixed-position antenna arrays, limiting their ability to fully exploit spatial diversity. This constraint reduces beamforming gain and significantly impairs RSMA performance. To address this problem, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided RSMA scheme that allows the antennas at the base station (BS) to dynamically adjust their positions. Our objective is to maximize the system sum rate of common and private messages by jointly optimizing the MA positions, beamforming matrix, and common rate allocation. To tackle the formulated non-convex problem, we apply fractional programming (FP) and develop an efficient two-stage, coarse-to-fine-grained searching (CFGS) algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that, with optimized antenna adjustments, the MA-enabled system achieves substantial performance and reliability improvements in RSMA over fixed-position antenna setups.</description>
