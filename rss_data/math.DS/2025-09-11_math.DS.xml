      <title>Complex dynamics and pattern formation in a diffusive epidemic model with an infection-dependent recovery rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A diffusive epidemic model with an infection-dependent recovery rate is formulated in this paper.
  Multiple constant steady states and spatially homogeneous periodic solutions are first proven by bifur cation analysis of the reaction kinetics. It is shown that the model exhibits diffusion-driven instability,
  where the infected population acts as an activator and the susceptible population functions as an in hibitor. The faster movement of the susceptible class will induce the spatial and spatiotemporal patterns,
  which are characterized by k-mode Turing instability and (k1,k2)-mode Turing-Hopf bifurcation. The
  transient dynamics from a purely temporal oscillatory regime to a spatial periodic pattern are discov ered. The model reveals key transmission dynamics, including asynchronous disease recurrence, spa tially patterned waves, and the formation of localized hotspots. The study suggests that spatially targeted
  strategies are necessary to contain disease waves that vary regionally and cyclically.</description>

      <title>Non-classifiability of mixing zero-entropy diffeomorphisms up to isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the problem of classifying, up to isomorphism, the collection of zero-entropy mixing automorphisms of a standard non-atomic probability space, is intractible. More precisely, the collection of isomorphic pairs of automorphisms in this class is not Borel, when considered as a subset of the Cartesian product of the collection of measure-preserving automorphisms with itself. This remains true if we restrict to zero-entropy mixing automorphisms that are also $C^{\infty}$ diffeomorphisms of the five-dimensional torus. In addition, both of these results still hold if ``isomorphism'' is replaced by ``Kakutani equivalence.''
  In our argument we show that for a uniquely and totally ergodic automorphism $U$ and a particular family of automorphisms $\mathcal{S}$, if $T\times U$ is isomorphic to $T^{-1}\times U$ with $T\in\mathcal{S}$ then $T$ is isomorphic to ${T^{-1}}$. However, this type of ``cancellation'' of factors from isomorphic Cartesian products is not true in general. We present an example due to M. Lema\'nczyk of two weakly mixing automorphisms $T$ and $S$ and an irrational rotation $R$ such that $T\times R$ is isomorphic to $S\times R$, but $T$ and $S$ are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Symbolic dynamics for non-uniformly hyperbolic flows in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct symbolic dynamics for flows with positive speed in any dimension: for each $\chi&gt;0$, we code a set that has full measure for every invariant probability measure which is $\chi$--hyperbolic. In particular, the coded set contains all hyperbolic periodic orbits with Lyapunov exponents outside of $[-\chi,\chi]$. This extends the recent work of Buzzi, Crovisier, and Lima for three dimensional flows with positive speed. As an application, we code homoclinic classes of measures by suspensions of irreducible countable Markov shifts, and prove that each such class has at most one probability measure that maximizes the entropy.</description>

      <title>Non-integrability of the Critical Systems for Optimal Sums of Eigenvalues of Sturm-Liouville Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal lower or upper bounds for sums of the first $m$ eigenvalues of Sturm-Liouville operators can be obtained by solving the corresponding critical systems, which are Hamiltonian systems of $m$ degrees of freedom with $m$ parameters. With the help of the differential Galois theory, we prove that these critical systems are not meromorphic integrable except for two known completely integrable cases. The non-integrability of the critical systems reveal certain complexities for the original eigenvalues problems.</description>

      <title>On Kanai's conjecture for frame flows over negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed, negatively curved Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \neq 4, 8$ with strictly $1/4$-pinched sectional curvature. We prove, that if the frame flow is ergodic and the sum of its unstable and stable bundles together with its flow direction is $\mathcal{C}^2$, then $M$ is homothetic to a real hyperbolic manifold. This extends to higher dimensions a previous result of Kanai in dimension 3. The proof generalises to isometric extensions of geodesic flows to a principal bundle $P$ with compact structure group and yields the following alternative : either $P$ is flat, or $M$ is hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Unstable entropy for Anosov diffeomorphisms on the 3-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Anosov diffeomorphisms on the $3$-torus which are strongly partially hyperbolic with expanding center, we construct systems of strong unstable and center stable Margulis measures which are holonomy-invariant. This allows us to obtain a characterization of the measures of maximal unstable entropy in terms of their conditional measures along the strong unstable leaves. Moreover, we show that the Margulis systems identify with Pollicott-Ruelle (co)-resonant states for the action on 2-forms. This shows that the unstable topological entropy and a measure of maximal unstable entropy can be retrieved from the spectral approach.</description>

      <title>A geometric formulation of GENERIC stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a coordinate-invariant geometric formulation of the GENERIC stochastic differential equation, unifying reversible Hamiltonian and irreversible dissipative dynamics within a differential-geometric framework. Our construction builds on the classical GENERIC formalism, extending it to manifolds by introducing a degenerate Poisson structure, a degenerate co-metric, and a volume form satisfying a unimodularity condition. The resulting equation preserves a particular Boltzmann-type measure, ensures almost-sure conservation of energy, and reduces to the deterministic metriplectic formulation in the zero-noise limit. This geometrization separates system-specific quantities from the ambient space, clarifies the roles of the underlying structures, and provides a foundation for analytic and numerical methods, as well as future extensions to quantum and coarse-grained systems.</description>

      <title>An entropy formula for the Deep Linear Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Riemannian geometry of the Deep Linear Network (DLN) as a foundation for a thermodynamic description of the learning process. The main tools are the use of group actions to analyze overparametrization and the use of Riemannian submersion from the space of parameters to the space of observables. The foliation of the balanced manifold in the parameter space by group orbits is used to define and compute a Boltzmann entropy. We also show that the Riemannian geometry on the space of observables defined in [2] is obtained by Riemannian submersion of the balanced manifold. The main technical step is an explicit construction of an orthonormal basis for the tangent space of the balanced manifold using the theory of Jacobi matrices.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangian formulations for (ir)reducible mixed-antisymmetric higher integer spin fields in Minkowski spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the results of Lagrangian formulations study to construct gauge-invariant Lagrangians for (ir)reducible integer higher-spin massless and massive representations of the Poincare group with a Young tableau $Y[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\hat{s}_3]$ in $d$-dimensional flat space-time (as the probable candidates to describe the Dark Matter problem beyond the SM). These particles are described within a metric-like formulation by tensor fields with 3 groups of antisymmetric Lorentz indices $\Phi_{\mu^1[{\hat{s}_1}],\mu^2[{\hat{s}_2}], \mu^3[{\hat{s}_3}]}$ on a basis of the
  BRST method with complete, $Q$, and incomplete, $Q_c$, BRST operators. We found unconstrained (with $Q$) and constrained (with $Q_c$ and off-shell BRST invariant holonomic constraints) gauge Lagrangian formulations with different configuration spaces and reducibility stages. The deformation procedure to construct interacting gauge model with mixed-antisymmetric fields is proposed.</description>

      <title>Conditioning on PDE Parameters to Generalise Deep Learning Emulation of Stochastic and Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a deep learning emulator for stochastic and chaotic spatio-temporal systems, explicitly conditioned on the parameter values of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach involves pre-training the model on a single parameter domain, followed by fine-tuning on a smaller, yet diverse dataset, enabling generalisation across a broad range of parameter values. By incorporating local attention mechanisms, the network is capable of handling varying domain sizes and resolutions. This enables computationally efficient pre-training on smaller domains while requiring only a small additional dataset to learn how to generalise to larger domain sizes. We demonstrate the model's capabilities on the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and stochastically-forced beta-plane turbulence, showcasing its ability to capture phenomena at interpolated parameter values. The emulator provides significant computational speed-ups over conventional numerical integration, facilitating efficient exploration of parameter space, while a probabilistic variant of the emulator provides uncertainty quantification, allowing for the statistical study of rare events.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the a.e. nonamenability of locally finite quasi-pmp Borel graphs whose every component admits at least three nonvanishing ends with respect to the underlying Radon--Nikodym cocycle. We witness their nonamenability by constructing Borel subforests with at least three nonvanishing ends per component, and then applying Tserunyan and Tucker-Drob's recent characterization of amenability for acyclic quasi-pmp Borel graphs. Our main technique is a weighted cycle-cutting algorithm, which yields a weight-maximal spanning forest. We also introduce a random version of this forest, which generalizes the Free Minimal Spanning Forest, to capture nonunimodularity in the context of percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Entropy plateaus, transitivity and bifurcation sets for the $\beta$-transformation with a hole at $0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\beta&gt;1$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$ such that $T_\beta(x)=\beta x\pmod 1$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never enters the interval $[0,t)$. Letting $\mathscr{E}_\beta$ denote the bifurcation set of the set-valued map $t\mapsto K_\beta(t)$, Kalle et al. [Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems, 40 (9): 2482--2514, 2020] conjectured that \[ \dim_H\big(\mathscr{E}_\beta\cap[t,1]\big)=\dim_H K_\beta(t) \qquad \forall\,t\in(0,1). \] The main purpose of this article is to prove this conjecture. We do so by investigating dynamical properties of the symbolic equivalent of the survivor set $K_\beta(t)$, in particular its entropy and topological transitivity. In addition, we compare $\mathscr{E}_\beta$ with the bifurcation set $\mathscr{B}_\beta$ of the map $t\mapsto \dim_H K_\beta(t)$ (which is a decreasing devil's staircase by a theorem of Kalle et al.), and show that, for Lebesgue-almost every $\beta&gt;1$, the difference $\mathscr{E}_\beta\backslash\mathscr{B}_\beta$ has positive Hausdorff dimension, but for every $k\in\{0,1,2,\dots\}\cup\{\aleph_0\}$, there are infinitely many values of $\beta$ such that the cardinality of $\mathscr{E}_\beta\backslash\mathscr{B}_\beta$ is exactly $k$. For a countable but dense subset of $\beta$'s, we also determine the intervals of constancy of the function $t\mapsto \dim_H K_\beta(t)$.
  Some connections with other topics in dynamics, such as kneading invariants of Lorenz maps and the doubling map with an arbitrary hole, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Sigma Flows for Image and Data Labeling and Learning Structured Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the sigma flow model for the prediction of structured labelings of data observed on Riemannian manifolds, including Euclidean image domains as special case. The approach combines the Laplace-Beltrami framework for image denoising and enhancement, introduced by Sochen, Kimmel and Malladi about 25 years ago, and the assignment flow approach introduced and studied by the authors.
  The sigma flow arises as Riemannian gradient flow of generalized harmonic energies and thus is governed by a nonlinear geometric PDE which determines a harmonic map from a closed Riemannian domain manifold to a statistical manifold, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric from information geometry. A specific ingredient of the sigma flow is the mutual dependency of the Riemannian metric of the domain manifold on the evolving state. This makes the approach amenable to machine learning in a specific way, by realizing this dependency through a mapping with compact time-variant parametrization that can be learned from data. Proof of concept experiments demonstrate the expressivity of the sigma flow model and prediction performance.
  Structural similarities to transformer network architectures and networks generated by the geometric integration of sigma flows are pointed out, which highlights the connection to deep learning and, conversely, may stimulate the use of geometric design principles for structured prediction in other areas of scientific machine learning.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a generic reservoir system admits a generalized synchronization that is a topological embedding of the input system's attractor. We also prove that for sufficiently high reservoir dimension (given by Nash's embedding theorem) there exists an isometric embedding generalized synchronization. The isometric embedding can be constructed explicitly when the reservoir system is linear.</description>

Abstract: We give some simple conditions under which a group acting on a bifoliated plane comes from the induced action of a pseudo-Anosov flow on its orbit space. An application of the strategy is a less technical proof of a result of Barbot that the induced action of an Anosov flow on its orbit space uniquely determines the flow up to orbit equivalence. In another application, we recover an expansive flow on a 3-manifold from the action of a group on a \emph{loom space} as defined by Schleimer and Segerman.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Systems as an Example of Invariant Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems are a classical example in the ergodic theory of flows with an invariant measure. In this matter, we present a brief introduction to measure theory and prove the Poincare recurrence theorem to present the conditions for a system to be conservative. In the following, we discuss the Hamiltonian differential equations, vector fields, and their respective flows as an example of this invariance.</description>

      <title>A bound for internal radii of stable manifolds in terms of Lyapunov exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find some bounds for the internal radii of stable and unstable manifolds of points in terms of their Lyapunov exponents under the assumption of the existence of a dominated splitting.</description>
