      <title>Comparison of reaction networks of insulin signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the insulin signaling cascade provides insights on the underlying mechanisms of biological phenomena such as insulin resistance, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. For this reason, previous studies utilized chemical reaction network theory to perform comparative analyses of reaction networks of insulin signaling in healthy (INSMS: INSulin Metabolic Signaling) and diabetic cells (INRES: INsulin RESistance). This study extends these analyses using various methods which give further insights regarding insulin signaling. Using embedded networks, we discuss evidence of the presence of a structural "bifurcation" in the signaling process between INSMS and INRES. Concordance profiles of INSMS and INRES show that both have a high propensity to remain monostationary. Moreover, the concordance properties allow us to present heuristic evidence that INRES has a higher level of stability beyond its monostationarity. Finally, we discuss a new way of analyzing reaction networks through network translation. This method gives rise to three new insights: (i) each stoichiometric class of INSMS and INRES contains a unique positive equilibrium; (ii) any positive equilibrium of INSMS is exponentially stable and is a global attractor in its stoichiometric class; and (iii) any positive equilibrium of INRES is locally asymptotically stable. These results open up opportunities for collaboration with experimental biologists to understand insulin signaling better.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>

Abstract: Extant life contains numerous non-equilibrium mechanisms to create order not achievable at equilibrium; it is generally assumed that these mechanisms evolved because the resulting order was sufficiently beneficial to overcome associated costs of time and energy. Here, we identify a broad range of conditions under which non-equilibrium order-creating mechanisms will evolve as an inevitable consequence of self-replication, even if the order is not directly functional. We show that models of polymerases, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve kinetic proofreading through selection for fast replication alone, consistent with data from recent mutational screens. Similarly, replication contingent on fast self-assembly can select for non-equilibrium instabilities and result in more ordered structures without any direct selection for order. We abstract these results into a framework that predicts that self-replication intrinsically amplifies dissipative order-enhancing mechanisms if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can arise more easily than assumed, even before that order is directly functional, with consequences impacting mutation rate evolution and kinetic traps in self-assembly to the origin of life.</description>
