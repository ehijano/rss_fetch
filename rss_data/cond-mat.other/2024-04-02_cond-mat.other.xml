      <title>Transient amplification in Floquet media: the Mathieu oscillator example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mathieu equation occurs naturally in the description of non linear vibrations or by considering the propagation of a wave in an infinite medium with time-periodic refractive index. It is known to lead to parametric instability since it supports unstable solutions in some regions of the parameter space. However, even in the stable region the matrix that propagates the initial conditions forward in time is non-normal and therefore it can result in transient amplification. By optimizing over initial conditions as well as initial time we show that significant transient amplifications can be obtained, going beyond the one simply stemming from adiabatic invariance. Moreover, we explore the monodromy matrix in more depth, by studying its $\epsilon$-pseudospectra and Petermann factors, demonstrating that is the degree of non-normality of this matrix that determines the global amplifying features.</description>

      <title>Measurement of nonequilibrium vortex propagation dynamics in a nonlinear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe and measure the nonequilibrium dynamics of optical vortices as a function of propagation distance through a nonlinear medium. The precession of a tilted-core vortex is quantified as is vortex-core sharpening, where the infinite width of a linear core subsequently shrinks and approaches the healing length of this nonlinear optical fluid. Experiments are performed with a variable-length nonlinear medium: a nonlinear fluid in a tank with an output window on a translating tube. This provides control over the distance the light propagates in the fluid and allows for the measurement of the dynamics throughout the entire propagation range. Results are compared to the predictions of a computational simulator to find the equivalent dimensionless nonlinear coefficient.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thickness-dependent dielectric permittivity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of thin films are of paramount important in a variety of technological applications, and of fundamental importance for solid state research. In spite of this, there is currently no theoretical understanding of the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the thickness of thin films. We develop a confinement model within the Lorentz-field framework for the microscopic Langevin-equation description of dielectric response in terms of the atomic-scale vibrational modes of the solid. Based on this, we derive analytical expressions for the dielectric permittivity as a function of thin film thickness, in excellent agreement with experimental data of Barium-Strontium-Titanate (BST) thin films of different stoichiometry. The theory shows that the decrease of dielectric permittivity with decreasing thickness is directly caused by the restriction in $k$-space of the available eigenmodes for field-induced alignment of ions and charged groups.</description>

      <title>Classical action for the height within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we write down a classical (not quantum) action for the surface height for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth. We do so starting with the regular Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) action (which is quantum - contains the constraint field) and integrate out the quantum constraint field exactly. We analyze the classical action, we thereby obtain, within the gaussian and one loop approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces. The gaussian analysis predicts instabilities to rough surfaces below two dimensions while one loop predicts stronger surface stability to roughness and instabilities to roughness below one dimension rather than two dimensions. The one loop analysis shows that the KPZ action is incomplete and that we generate additional terms (not found in the initial action) in the action perturbatively. In the supplement we also modify the KPZ equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have multiplicatively coupled noise).</description>
