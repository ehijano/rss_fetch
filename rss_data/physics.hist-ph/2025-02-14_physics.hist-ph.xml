      <title>Algorithmic Idealism III: "Algorithmic State" Formulation of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Algorithmic Idealism a framework that reinterprets quantum mechanics as a computational process governed by algorithmic probability informational simplicity and utility optimization Reality is modeled as an agentenvironment feedback loop where agents maximize utility by predicting selfstate transitions Core quantum phenomena such as measurement entanglement and probabilities are explained through informational constructs The paper presents a set of quantum mechanics postulates inspired by this framework and explains their mathematical meaning in detail These postulates include measurement as Bayesian updating entanglement as joint utility optimization and quantum probabilities as utilityweighted predictions Physical laws are shown to emerge as informational regularities from algorithmic constraints By defining identity through decisionmaking consistency and treating simulated and base realities as indistinguishable the framework also resolves philosophical questions about identity and reality This approach unifies quantum mechanics with computational theory offering a novel perspective on foundational physics and its connection to information and computation</description>

      <title>Notes on a future quantum event-ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay is a two-step reflection on the question 'Which events (can be said to) occur in quantum phenomena?' The first step regiments the ontological category of "statistical phenomena" and studies the adequacy of "probabilistic event models" as descriptions thereof. Guided by the conviction that quantum phenomena are to be circumscribed within this same ontological category, the second step highlights the peculiarities of probabilistic event models of some non-relativistic quantum phenomena, and thereby of what appear to be some plausible answers to our initial question. The reflection ends in an aporetic state, as it is by now usual in encounters between ontology and the quantum.</description>

      <title>The prince and the pauper. A quantum paradox of Hilbert-space fundamentalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum world is described by a unit vector in the Hilbert space and the Hamiltonian. Do these abstract basis-independent objects give a complete description of the physical world, or should we include observables like positions and momenta and the decomposition into subsystems? According to "Hilbert-space fundamentalism" they give a complete description, and all other features of the physical world emerge from them (Carroll, arXiv:2103.09780). Here I will give a concrete refutation of this thesis based on the symmetries of the theory of quantum measurements. These results show that even if a tensor product structure is assumed along with the unit vector and the Hamiltonian, concrete physically distinct worlds can be described by the same structures.</description>

      <title>Reproducing EPR correlations without superluminal signalling: backward conditional probabilities and Statistical Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bell's theorem states that no model that respects Local Causality and Statistical Independence can account for the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics via entangled states. This paper proposes a new approach, using backward-in-time conditional probabilities, which relaxes conventional assumptions of temporal ordering while preserving Statistical Independence as a "fine-tuning condition. It is shown how such models can account for EPR/Bell correlations and, analogously, the GHZ predictions while nevertheless forbidding superluminal signalling.</description>
