      <title>Classification of Willmore $2$-spheres in $S^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves a long-standing open problem by providing a classification of Willmore $2$-spheres in $S^n$. We show that any such $2$-sphere is either totally isotropic--originating from the projection of a special twistor curve in the twistor bundle over an even-dimensional sphere--or strictly $k$-isotropic, obtained via $(m-k)$ steps of adjoint transforms of a strictly $m$-isotropic minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $0\leq k\leq m\leq[n/2]-2$. Our approach hinges on the construction of a harmonic sequence in the real Grassmannian over the Lorentz space, derived from the harmonic conformal Gauss map of the original Willmore sphere. This sequence terminates finitely and generalizes, in part, the classical theory of harmonic sequences for harmonic $2$-spheres in complex Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Concentration and relevant properties of Finsler metric measure manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study systematically the concentration properties of Finsler metric measure manifolds. We establish the relationships between the concentration properties and the observable diameter, isoperimetric inequalities and the first eigenvalue. In particular, as an application, we derive a Cheng type upper bound estimate for the first closed eigenvalue via the concentration property. The researches in this paper enrich and extend the concentration theory in Finsler geometry, even in irreversible metric measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, after explaining some basic aspects of the modern theory of foliations with the aim of describing the celebrated Reeb foliation, we propose the first construction of a comprehensive physical model of it. The construction of the model is obtained by an implementation of geometric methods for 3D printing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a compact oriented riemannian four-manifold with harmonic and pinched self-dual Weyl curvature is anti-self-dual if the type is nonpositive. The main part is to show that there is an almost-K\"ahler structure outside the zero set of the self-dual Weyl curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the smoothness of a plane curve and that of its evolute, especially in the cases where the parent curve is no more two or three times continuously differentiable, and exhibit the same kind of apparent improvement in regularity: in the generic local situation, the evolute has one order of regularity less than the parent curve.</description>

      <title>Invariant valuations on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolution of valuations was introduced by the first named author and Fu for linear spaces, and later by Alesker and the first named author for compact Lie groups. In this paper we study the convolution of invariant valuations on Lie groups. First, we obtain an explicit formula for the convolution of left-invariant valuations on compact groups in terms of differential forms. Independently, we show that a connected Lie group admits smooth bi-invariant valuations beyond the Euler characteristic and the Haar measure if and only if the group is the product of a compact group and a linear space. Finally, we use these two results to define the convolution of bi-invariant smooth valuations on an arbitrary unimodular Lie group, thus unifying both previously defined convolution operations.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces over the Pitot quadrilaterals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully explicit framework for constructing Scherk-type minimal graphs over the Pitot quadrilaterals (i.e. such that the two pairs of opposite sides have the same total length). For any Pitot quadrilateral \(Q\), we first produce a harmonic diffeomorphism of the unit disk onto \(Q\), whose dilatation is the square of a M\"obius automorphism determined directly by the vertices of \(Q\). Using this map as the Weierstrass data, we obtain a minimal graph \(\Sigma\) whose Gauss map is a univalent M\"obius transformation and whose height function exhibits alternating blow-up behavior along opposite sides of \(Q\), mirroring the classical Scherk surfaces. We further construct an associated canonical surface \(\Sigma^\diamond\), with the same boundary asymptotics, and prove a sharp curvature comparison theorem: at the harmonic center of \(Q\), among all bounded minimal graphs with matching normal direction and mixed derivative, \(\Sigma^\diamond\) uniquely maximizes the absolute Gaussian curvature. This provides a complete and constructive description of Scherk-type minimal graphs over all, both convex or concave, Pitot quadrilaterals.</description>

      <title>Differential Geometry of the Fixed-Rank Core Covariance Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the differential geometry of the fixed-rank core covariance manifold. According to Hoff, McCormack, and Zhang [J. R. Stat. Soc., B: Stat., 85 (2023), pp. 1659--1679], every covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of $p_1\times p_2$ matrix-variate data uniquely decomposes into a separable component $K$ and a core component $C$. Such a decomposition may exist for rank-$r$ $\Sigma$ if $p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1&lt;r$, with $C$ sharing the same rank. They posed an open question on whether a partial-isotropy structure can be imposed on $C$ for high-dimensional covariance estimation. We address this question by showing that a partial-isotropy rank-$r$ core is a non-trivial convex combination of a rank-$r$ core and $I_p$ for $p:=p_1p_2$, motivating the study of rank-$r$ cores. For fixed $r&gt;p_1/p_2+p_2/p_1$, we prove that the set of rank-$r$ cores, $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, is a compact, smooth, embedded submanifold of the set of rank-$r$ positive semi-definite matrices, except for a measure-zero subset associated with canonical decomposability. When $r=p$, the set of full-rank cores $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ is itself a smooth manifold. Moreover, the positive definite cone $\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ is diffeomorphic to the product of the Kronecker and core covariance manifolds, providing new geometric insight into $\mathcal{S}_p^{++}$ via separability. Differential geometric quantities, such as the differential of the diffeomorphism, as well as the Riemannian gradient and Hessian operator on $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2}^{++}$ and the manifolds used in constructing $\mathcal{C}_{p_1,p_2,r}^+$, are also derived. Lastly, we propose a partial-isotropy core shrinkage estimator for matrix-variate data, supported by numerical illustrations.</description>

Abstract: We investigated singular points of translation surfaces under the linearly independent condition. In this paper, as completion, we investigate singular points of translation surfaces under the linearly dependent condition, using the theories of generalised framed surfaces and framed surfaces. We introduce the notion of translation generalised framed surfaces and investigate types of singular points that appear on translation generalised framed base surfaces.</description>

      <title>The parallel transport map over reductive homogeneous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the parallel transport map over a reductive homogeneous space with natural torsion-free connection becomes an affine submersion with horizontal distribution. This generalizes one of the main results in the author's previous paper in the case of affine symmetric spaces. We also prove the compactness of the shape operators of the submanifold lifted by the parallel transport map. This improves a previous result by the author and generalizes some results of Terng-Thorbergsson and of Koike. Furthermore we propose two definitions for the regularized mean curvatures of affine Fredholm submanifolds in Hilbertable spaces and discuss their relations to the parallel transport map. In particular, each fiber of the parallel transport map over a reductive homogeneous space is shown to be minimal in both senses.</description>

      <title>Completeness of reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics on the space of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reparametrization-invariant Sobolev-type Riemannian metrics on the space of immersed surfaces and establish conditions ensuring metric and geodesic completeness as well as the existence of minimizing geodesics. This provides the first extension of completeness results for immersed curves, originating from works of Bruveris, Michor, and Mumford, and validates an earlier conjecture of Mumford on completeness properties of general spaces of immersions in this important case.
  The result is obtained by recasting earlier approaches to completeness on manifolds of mappings as a general completeness criterion for infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that are open subsets of a complete Riemannian manifold and by combining it with geometric estimates based on the Michael--Simon--Sobolev inequality to establish the completeness for specific Sobolev metrics on immersed surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study invariants of curves parametrized by a real variable in the dual plane $\mathbb{D}^2$ under equiaffine transformations. We then obtain explicit equations for all curves in $\mathbb{D}^2$ whose equiaffine curvature is a dual constant. In particular, we prove that when the equiaffine curvature is a pure real constant, both the real and dual parts of the curve in $\mathbb{D}^2$ are quadratic curves. In addition, we provide a complete classification of spacelike and timelike curves parametrized by a real variable in the dual Lorentz--Minkowski plane $\mathbb{D}^2_1$ whose curvature is a dual constant.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the Bonnet problem in Thurston geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Bonnet problem in Bianchi--Cartan--Vr\u{a}nceanu spaces and in $\mathrm{Sol}_3$. Our main contribution is to establish the uniqueness of Bonnet mates, which leads us to address the problem of determining when an isometric immersion can be continuously deformed through isometric immersions that preserve the principal curvatures -- a question originally posed in $\mathbb{R}^3$ by Chern~\cite{Chern}. For Bianchi--Cartan--Vr\u{a}nceanu spaces, we complete the local classification of Bonnet pairs by studying the uniqueness of the results obtained by G\'alvez, Mart\'inez and Mira~\cite{GMM}, and we provide new examples of Bonnet mates that were not previously considered. In particular, we prove that the aforesaid continuous deformations only exist for minimal surfaces in the product spaces $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$ and otherwise only for surfaces with constant principal curvatures. In the case of $\mathrm{Sol}_3$, we give a characterization of Bonnet mates via a system of two differential equations, addressing a problem proposed in~\cite{GMM}. We conclude that the only surfaces admitting continuous isometric deformations that preserve the principal curvatures in $\mathrm{Sol}_3$ are those with constant left-invariant Gauss map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove linear semi-stability for a large class of Einstein metrics of non-positive scalar curvature. More precisely, we show that any Einstein $n$-manifold with non-positive scalar curvature carrying a parallel twisted pure spin$^r$ spinor is linearly semi-stable, under mild restrictions on $n$ and $r$. We thus extend the parallel spin and spin$^c$ stability results of Dai--Wang--Wei. As an application, our result implies linear semi-stability for all negative quaternion-K{\"a}hler manifolds of dimension greater than $8$.</description>

      <title>Hessian geometry and Frobenius manifolds with curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Riemannian metric is called Hessian if, locally, it can be written as the Hessian of a function called the Hessian potential. A (flat) Manin-Frobenius manifold is a flat Riemannian manifold furnished with a commutative and associative product compatible with the metric, such that a certain potentiality property is satisfied. Curved Frobenius manifolds generalize this concept to spaces with non-vanishing curvature, and they have applications in supersymmetric mechanics and within the theory of submanifolds.
  Curved Frobenius manifolds naturally arise from Hessian metrics, and we find that they, conceptually, are the typical non-trivial examples. We obtain that Curved Frobenius structures on constant curvature spaces are consistent with a Hessian structure, if they satisfy a closed prolongation system of finite type. Consistency means that the Frobenius potential and the Hessian potential can be identified.
  As an application, we show that certain second-order maximally superintegrable systems correspond 1-to-1 to Curved Frobenius structures that are consistent with a Hessian structure.</description>

Using asymptotic cycles and chain-recurrent sets, we establish topological conditions that guarantee the existence of a Lyapunov 1-form, lying in a prescribed cohomology class, for a given vector field on a compact orbifold.</description>

      <title>Emergent Riemannian geometry over learning discrete computations on continuous manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many tasks require mapping continuous input data (e.g. images) to discrete task outputs (e.g. class labels). Yet, how neural networks learn to perform such discrete computations on continuous data manifolds remains poorly understood. Here, we show that signatures of such computations emerge in the representational geometry of neural networks as they learn. By analysing the Riemannian pullback metric across layers of a neural network, we find that network computation can be decomposed into two functions: discretising continuous input features and performing logical operations on these discretised variables. Furthermore, we demonstrate how different learning regimes (rich vs. lazy) have contrasting metric and curvature structures, affecting the ability of the networks to generalise to unseen inputs. Overall, our work provides a geometric framework for understanding how neural networks learn to perform discrete computations on continuous manifolds.</description>

      <title>Fiber Bundle Networks: A Geometric Machine Learning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Fiber Bundle Networks (FiberNet), a novel machine learning framework integrating differential geometry with machine learning. Unlike traditional deep neural networks relying on black-box function fitting, we reformulate classification as interpretable geometric optimization on fiber bundles, where categories form the base space and wavelet-transformed features lie in the fibers above each category. We introduce two innovations: (1) learnable Riemannian metrics identifying important frequency feature components, (2) variational prototype optimization through energy function minimization. Classification is performed via Voronoi tessellation under the learned Riemannian metric, where each prototype defines a decision region and test samples are assigned to the nearest prototype, providing clear geometric interpretability. This work demonstrates that the integration of fiber bundle with machine learning provides interpretability and efficiency, which are difficult to obtain simultaneously in conventional deep learning.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the equilibrium measures of geodesic flows of closed manifolds without conjugate points which have a visibility universal covering. Specifically, the uniqueness problem for Bowen potentials which are constants on some sets--intersection of horospheres-- and satisfy a weak pressure gap. Moreover, we study some ergodic properties of these measures such as the K-mixing property, weighted equidistribution of closed geodesics, the Gibbs property, large deviations and the entropy density of ergodic measures. Assuming, furthermore continuity of Green bundles, existence of a hyperbolic closed geodesic and a Gromov hyperbolic universal covering we prove that the above potentials always satisfy the weak pressure gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a Brownian motion on the quaternionic full flag manifold can be represented as a matrix-valued diffusion obtained in a simple way from a symplectic Brownian motion. By relating its radial dynamics to the Brownian motion on the quaternionic sphere, an explicit formula for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the quaternionic stochastic areas is obtained. The limit law of these quaternionic stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and non-diagonal covariance matrix. These results are subsequently applied to establish new results about simultaneous quaternionic windings on the quaternionic spheres.</description>

      <title>Around the semi-classical limit of boundary Liouville conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory describes a random geometry that fluctuates around a deterministic one: the unique solution of the problem of finding, within a given conformal class, a Riemannian metric with prescribed scalar and geodesic curvatures as well as conical singularities and corners. The level of randomness in Liouville theory is measured by the coupling constant $\gamma\in(0,2)$, the semi-classical limit corresponding to taking $\gamma\to0$.
  Based on the probabilistic definition of Liouville theory, we prove that this semi-classical limit exists and does give rise to this deterministic geometry. At second order this limit is described in terms of a massive Gaussian free field with Robin boundary conditions.
  This in turn allows to implement CFT-inspired techniques in a deterministic setting: in particular we define the classical stress-energy tensor, show that it can be expressed in terms of accessory parameters (written as regularized derivatives of the Liouville action), and that it gives rise to classical higher equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every nearly spherical manifold can be realized as the volume-preserving image of a round sphere, via the Brenier-McCann optimal transport map. This theorem extends Caffarelli's contraction theorem to nearly spherical manifolds and yields, as a corollary, a proof of a perturbative form of Milman's conjecture. The proof is based on a novel stability result for optimal transport maps on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Horizon Data: Existence Results and a Near-Horizon Equation on General Null Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g)$, a horizon is a null hypersurface where the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}:=\pounds_{\eta}g$ of a null and tangent vector $\eta$ satisfies certain restrictions. In this work, we develop a formalism to study the geometry of \textit{general} horizons (i.e. characterized by any $\mathcal{K}$), based on encoding the zeroth and first transverse derivatives of $\mathcal{K}$ on null hypersurfaces detached from any ambient spacetime. We introduce the notions of \textit{$\mathcal{K}$-tuple} and \textit{non-isolation tensor}. The former encodes the order zero of $\mathcal{K}$, while the latter is a symmetric $2$-covariant tensor that codifies the ``degree of isolation" of a horizon. In particular, the non-isolation tensor vanishes for homothetic, Killing and isolated horizons. As an application we derive a \textit{generalized near-horizon equation}, i.e., an identity that holds on any horizon (regardless of its topology or whether it contains fixed points), which relates the non-isolation tensor, a certain torsion one-form, and curvature terms. By restricting this equation to a cross-section one can recover the near-horizon equation of isolated horizons and the master equation of multiple Killing horizons. Our formalism allows us to prove two existence theorems for horizons. Specifically, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a non-degenerate totally geodesic horizon with any prescribed non-isolation tensor to be embeddable in a spacetime satisfying any (non-necessarily $\Lambda$-vacuum) field equations. We treat first the case of arbitrary topology, and then show how the result can be strengthened when the horizon admits a cross-section.</description>

Abstract: We construct Cauchy initial data for the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon (EMKG) system, which evolves in finite time into spacetimes containing multiple trapped surfaces. From a physical perspective, this corresponds to preparing multiple well-separated boson stars, each of which collapses to form a spacelike black hole region. In particular, this extends the result of the second and third named authors on the formation of multiple trapped surfaces in vacuum to the EMKG system.</description>

Abstract: Let $H$ be a strongly irreducible Heegaard surface in a closed oriented Riemannian $3$-manifold. We prove that $H$ is either isotopic to a minimal surface of index at most one or isotopic to the boundary of a tubular neighborhood about a non-orientable minimal surface with a vertical handle attached. This confirms a long-standing conjecture of J. Pitts and J.H. Rubinstein.</description>

Abstract: We prove that an \'etale fibration between $L_\infty$-bundles admits local sections composed of several elementary morphisms of particularly simple and accessible type. As applications, we establish an inverse function theorem for $L_\infty$-bundles and provide an elementary proof that every weak equivalence of $L_\infty$-bundles induces a quasi-isomorphism of the differential graded algebras of global functions. Furthermore, we apply this inverse function theorem to show that the homotopy category of $L_\infty$-bundles admits a simple description in terms of homotopy classes of morphisms, when $L_\infty$-bundles are restricted to their germs around their classical loci.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08619v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a compact manifold with boundary, the map consisting of the scalar curvature in the interior and the mean curvature on the boundary is a local surjection at generic metrics. We prove that this result may be localized to compact subdomains in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with boundary. This result is a generalization of Corvino's result about localized scalar curvature deformations; however, the existence part needs to be handled delicately since the linearized problem is non-variational. We also discuss generic conditions that guarantee localized deformations, and related geometric properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove various comparison theorems of the $i$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ of the Laplacian on fibred Riemannian manifolds by using fiberwise spherical and Euclidean (or hyperbolic) symmetrization. In particular we generalize the Lichnerowicz inequality and the Faber-Krahn inequality to fiber bundles, and prove a counterpart to Cheng's $\lambda_1$ comparison theorem under a lower Ricci curvature bound.
  By applying these, it is shown that $\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_k$ of a fiber bundle given by a Riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers of sufficiently positive Ricci curvature are respectively equal to $\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_k$ of its base, and $\lambda_1$ of a (possibly singular) fibration with Euclidean subsets as fibers is no less than $\lambda_1$ of the disk bundle obtained by replacing each fiber with a Euclidean disk of the same dimension and volume.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural notion of constant curvature Lorentzian surfaces with conical singularities, and provide a large class of examples of such structures. We moreover initiate the study of their global rigidity, by proving that de-Sitter tori with a single singularity of a fixed angle are determined by the topological equivalence class of their lightlike bi-foliation. While this is reminiscent of Troyanov's uniformization results on Riemannian surfaces with conical singularities, the rigidity will come from topological dynamics in the Lorentzian case.</description>

      <title>The Willmore problem for surfaces with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Willmore Problem seeks closed surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3\subset\mathbb{R}^4$ of a given topological type minimizing the squared-mean-curvature energy $W = \int |H_{\mathbb{R}^4}|^2 = area + \int |H_{\mathbb{S}^3}|^2$. The longstanding Willmore Conjecture that the Clifford torus minimizes $W$ among genus-$1$ surfaces is now a theorem of Marques and Neves [22], but the general conjecture [12] that Lawson's [18] minimal surface $\xi_{g,1}\subset\mathbb{S}^3$ minimizes $W$ among surfaces of genus $g&gt;1$ remains open. Here we prove this conjecture under the additional assumption that the competitor surfaces $M\subset\mathbb{S}^3$ share the ambient symmetries $\widehat{G}_{g,1}$ of $\xi_{g,1}$. In fact, we show each Lawson surface $\xi_{m,k}$ satisfies the corresponding $W$-minimizing property under a smaller symmetry group $\widetilde{G}_{m,k}=\widehat{G}_{m,k}\cap SO(4)$. We also describe a genus 2 example where known methods do not ensure the existence of a $W$-minimizer among surfaces with its symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study unknottedness for free boundary minimal surfaces in a three-dimensional Riemannian manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary, and for self-shrinkers in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. For doing so, we introduce the concepts of boundary graph for free boundary minimal surfaces and of graph at infinity for self-shrinkers. We prove that these surfaces are unknotted in the sense that any two such surfaces with isomorphic boundary graph or graph at infinity are smoothly isotopic.</description>

Abstract: For any Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle with Nakano positive curvature tensor, Demailly introduced a Monge-Amp\`ere type equation. When the rank of the bundle is $1$, it becomes the usual Monge-Amp\`ere equation. In this paper, we solve this equation in the conformal class of a Nakano positive Hermitian metric.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Infinitesimal Conformal Rigidity on Complex Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every conformal vector field on the complex hyperbolic space $\mathbb{C}H^n$ is Killing for all $n\ge 2$. Although this rigidity is classically known, our proof is entirely different in nature: it is local, analytic, and fully constructive. Our approach is local, analytic, and constructive: we view $\mathbb{C}H^2$ through its solvable Lie group model and express the conformal Killing equation as an explicit system of partial differential equations. By solving this system completely, we show that any conformal vector field must be determined by a Killing field. The analysis in complex dimension $2$ naturally extends to arbitrary $n$, yielding a unified and fully explicit proof of this rigidity phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Some Poincar\'{e}--Sobolev inequalities for differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the~study of embeddings between different classes of Sobolev spaces of differential forms started in 2006 in a~paper by Gol$'$dshtein and Troyanov. As in this paper, our study is based on relations between $L_{q,p}$-cohomology and Sobolev type inequalities. The~main results are estimates for the norms of the embedding operators for $q=p$ and $p&gt;\frac{n-1}{k-1}$ in the~Euclidean $r$-ball $B(r)$ and its bi-Lipschitz images. We also study the~compactness of such operators.</description>

Abstract: Diffeology extends differential geometry to spaces beyond smooth manifolds. This paper explores diffeology's key features and illustrates its utility with examples including singular and quotient spaces, and applications in symplectic geometry and prequantization. Diffeology provides a natural and effective framework for handling complexities from singularities and infinite-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Liouville theorem for biharmonic functions on manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend Yau's celebrated Liouville theorem to the biharmonic case. Namely, we show that in a complete Riemannian manifold with a pole and nonnegative Ricci curvature, any biharmonic function of subquadratic growth must be harmonic, and hence, any biharmonic function of sublinear growth must be constant. Our proof relies on a new local $L^2$ estimate for the Laplacian of biharmonic functions combined with a mean value inequality. Examples where our theorem applies include hypersurfaces of positive sectional curvature in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and manifolds with a pole of nonnegative Ricci curvature whose curvature decays at infinity rapidly enough.</description>

      <title>Lie groups with a bi-invariant distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a Lie group $G$ admitting a bi-invariant distance must be the product $G=H\times K$ of an abelian group $H$ and a compact group $K$ with discrete center. Moreover, the distance in $G$ must come from the infima of lengths of paths for a unique infinitesimal metric (a Finsler norm) defined in the Lie algebra of $G$. From this we derive the distance minimizing paths which are left or right translations of one-parameter groups (though these are not the unique minizing paths if the norm is not smooth or strictly convex). Then we introduce a notion of sectional curvature $sec(\pi)$ for a bi-invariant distance, following Milnor's ideas, and we show that this curvature is bounded and non-negative, and it is null when the $2$-plane $\pi$ is an abelian Lie subalgebra of $Lie(G)$. We show that when the distance is strictly convex, our sectional curvature vanishes if and only if the $2$-plane is abelian. We give finer characterizations for the case of vanishing curvature, for the case of non-strictly convex norms</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Functorial Free Group from Anosov Representations on Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action via $\rho$ to the space of connections on the pullbacks of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$.
  When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex curve, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of Higgs bundle structures associated with the $(1,0)$ part of the complexified pullback bundles. We further construct a free abelian group $F^{ab}$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and induce a topoogical structure on it, so that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F^{ab} \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free abelian group is well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure compatible with $\Omega_\rho$ and construct a natural functor to the category of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates for the relative isoperimetric problem and its gradient flow outside convex bodies in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove three related quantitative results for the relative isoperimetric problem outside a convex body $\Omega$ in the plane: (1) {\L}ojasiewicz estimates and quantitative rigidity for critical points, (2) rates of convergence for the gradient flow, and (3) quantitative stability for minimizers. These results come with explicit constants and optimal exponents/rates, and hold whenever a simple two-dimensional auxiliary variational problem for circular arcs outside of $\Omega$ is nondegenerate. The proofs are inter-related, and in particular, for the first time in the context of isoperimetric problems, a flow approach is used to prove quantitative stability for minimizers.</description>

      <title>The Fourth Geometry I: Difference--Angle Geometry Beyond Euclid, Hyperbolic, and Elliptic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new geometry based on the difference angle, an angle defined as the difference of slopes of two lines, together with an axiomatic system for angles. This framework provides a constructive approach to the fundamental question ``What is an angle?'', and shows that an angle can be defined independently of circles or rotations, as a primary geometric notion.
  Within this geometry, one can define difference-angle triangles, norms, bisectors, perpendiculars, and inner products. Several characteristic properties not seen in existing geometries emerge, together with behaviors analogous to those in Euclidean geometry: the triangle inequality always holds with equality, the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is $0$, and a Miquel point exists even for parabolas. In particular, the concurrency of the parabolic Miquel configuration was suggested by Weiss and Odehnal, and our main theorem provides the first explicit and rigorous confirmation of this assertion. We also point out that many classical Euclidean configurations (including Brocard-type configurations) naturally reappear in the setting of difference-angle geometry.
  These results indicate that difference-angle geometry is a promising candidate for a ``Fourth Geometry'' following the Euclidean, hyperbolic, and elliptic geometries.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of the Loop Equation and Quark Confinement in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytic confining area law for pure $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory, satisfying the hierarchy of multiloop equations for arbitrary regular loops and any number of colors $N_c$. The solution is constructed using a quaternionic Hodge-dual minimal surface in a 16-dimensional auxiliary space. Unlike random surfaces, this construction defines an effectively topological string theory where the bulk dynamics reduces to the area of a conformal map of the 2D disk, with all nontrivial dynamics encoded in the boundary loop.
  The Wilson loop factorizes into a confining dressing factor and a perturbative term: $W[C] = W_{\text{pert}}[C]\, e^{-\kappa S[C]}$. We show that the geometric factor $e^{-\kappa S[C]}$ is an exact multiplicative zero mode of the loop-space diffusion operator and of the full MM multiloop hierarchy for any finite $N_c$, extending the planar area law to the physical case $N_c=3$. The functional $S[C]$ obeys the inequality $S[C] \ge \sqrt{2}\,A[C]$ (where $A[C]$ is the Euclidean minimal area), providing a sufficient condition for confinement.
  The area law is given explicitly by the spectral formula $S[C] = 2\sqrt{2}\,(\lambda_3 + \lambda_4)$, using the two largest eigenvalues of the Douglas--Gram matrix. We demonstrate that this functional is an exact additive zero mode of the loop diffusion operator, protected algebraically by the Bianchi identity, and globally defined for regular loops $C \in H^{1/2}(\mathbb{S}^1,\mathbb{R}^4)$. Matching this factor with the gluon condensate via the OPE determines the physical string tension $\kappa \sim \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}^2$. This framework yields a first-principles derivation of confinement in QCD and new tools for the high-lying meson spectrum.</description>
