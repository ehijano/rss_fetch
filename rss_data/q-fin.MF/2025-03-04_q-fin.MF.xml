      <title>Strong Solutions and Quantization-Based Numerical Schemes for a Class of Non-Markovian Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of non-Markovian processes that hold particular relevance in the realm of mathematical finance. This family encompasses path-dependent volatility models, including those pioneered by [Platen and Rendek, 2018] and, more recently, by [Guyon and Lekeufack, 2023], as well as an extension of the framework proposed by [Blanc et al., 2017]. Our study unfolds in two principal phases. In the first phase, we introduce a functional quantization scheme based on an extended version of the Lamperti transformation that we propose to handle the presence of a memory term incorporated into the diffusion coefficient. For scenarios involving a Brownian integral in the diffusion term, we propose alternative numerical schemes that leverage the power of marginal recursive quantization. In the second phase, we study the problem of existence and uniqueness of a strong solution for the SDEs related to the examples that motivate our study, in order to provide a theoretical basis to correctly apply the proposed numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Commodity Futures Term Structure Through Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signature methods have been widely and effectively used as a tool for feature extraction in statistical learning methods, notably in mathematical finance. They lack, however, interpretability: in the general case, it is unclear why signatures actually work. The present article aims to address this issue directly, by introducing and developing the concept of signature perturbations. In particular, we construct a regular perturbation of the signature of the term structure of log prices for various commodities, in terms of the convenience yield. Our perturbation expansion and rigorous convergence estimates help explain the success of signature-based classification of commodities markets according to their term structure, with the volatility of the convenience yield as the major discriminant.</description>

      <title>Pricing time-capped American options using Least Squares Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we adopt the least squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method to price time-capped American options. The aforementioned cap can be an independent random variable or dependent on asset price at random time. We allow various time caps. In particular, we give an algorithm for pricing the American options capped by the first drawdown epoch. We focus on the geometric L\'evy market. We prove that our estimator converges to the true price as one takes the discretisation step tending to zero and the number of trajectories going to infinity.</description>

      <title>The Volterra Stein-Stein model with stochastic interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Volterra Stein-Stein model with stochastic interest rates, where both volatility and interest rates are driven by correlated Gaussian Volterra processes. This framework unifies various well-known Markovian and non-Markovian models while preserving analytical tractability for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. We derive explicit formulas for pricing zero-coupon bond and interest rate cap or floor, along with a semi-explicit expression for the characteristic function of the log-forward index using Fredholm resolvents and determinants. This allows for fast and efficient derivative pricing and calibration via Fourier methods. We calibrate our model to market data and observe that our framework is flexible enough to capture key empirical features, such as the humped-shaped term structure of ATM implied volatilities for cap options and the concave ATM implied volatility skew term structure (in log-log scale) of the S&amp;P 500 options. Finally, we establish connections between our characteristic function formula and expressions that depend on infinite-dimensional Riccati equations, thereby making the link with conventional linear-quadratic models.</description>

      <title>Optimal retirement in presence of stochastic labor income: a free boundary approach in an incomplete market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the optimal retirement problem in the presence of a stochastic wage, formulated as a free boundary problem. Specifically, we explore an incomplete market setting where the wage cannot be perfectly hedged through investments in the risk-free and risky assets that characterize the financial market.</description>

      <title>Model-free portfolio allocation in continuous-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-probabilistic, path-by-path framework for studying path-dependent (i.e., where weight is a functional of time and historical time-series), long-only portfolio allocation in continuous-time based on [Chiu &amp; Cont '23], where the fundamental concept of self-financing was introduced, independent of any integration theory. In this article, we extend this concept to a portfolio allocation strategy and characterize it by a path-dependent partial differential equation. We derive the general explicit solution that describes the evolution of wealth in generic markets, including price paths that may not evolve continuously or exhibit variation of any order. Explicit solution examples are provided.
  As an application of our continuous-time, path-dependent framework, we extend an aggregating algorithm of [Vovk '90] and the universal algorithm of [Cover '91] to continuous-time algorithms that combine multiple strategies into a single strategy. These continuous-time (meta) algorithms take multiple strategies as input (which may themselves be generated by other algorithms) and track the wealth generated by the best individual strategy and the best convex combination of strategies, with tracking error bounds in log wealth of order O(1) and O(ln t), respectively. This work extends Cover's theorem [Cover '91, Thm 6.1] to a continuous-time, model-free setting.</description>

      <title>The Relative Entropy of Expectation and Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08613v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As operators acting on the undetermined final settlement of a derivative security, expectation is linear but price is non-linear. When the market of underlying securities is incomplete, non-linearity emerges from the bid-offer around the mid price that accounts for the residual risks of the optimal funding and hedging strategy. At the extremes, non-linearity also arises from the embedded options on capital that are exercised upon default. In this essay, these convexities are quantified in an entropic risk metric that evaluates the strategic risks, which is realised as a cost with the introduction of bilateral margin. Price is then adjusted for market incompleteness and the risk of default caused by the exhaustion of capital.
  In the complete market theory, price is derived from a martingale condition. In the incomplete market theory presented here, price is instead derived from a log-martingale condition: \begin{equation} p=-\frac{1}{\alpha}\log\mathbb{E}\exp[-\alpha P] \notag \end{equation} for the price $p$ and payoff $P$ of a funded and hedged derivative security, where the price measure $\mathbb{E}$ has minimum entropy relative to economic expectations, and the parameter $\alpha$ matches the risk aversion of the investor. This price principle is easily applied to standard models for market evolution, with applications considered here including model risk analysis, deep hedging and decentralised finance.</description>
