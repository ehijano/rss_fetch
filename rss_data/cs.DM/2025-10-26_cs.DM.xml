      <title>On Local Limits of Sparse Random Graphs: Color Convergence and the Refined Configuration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local convergence has emerged as a fundamental tool for analyzing sparse random graph models. We introduce a new notion of local convergence, color convergence, based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. Color convergence fully characterizes the class of random graphs that are well-behaved in the limit for message-passing graph neural networks. Building on this, we propose the Refined Configuration Model (RCM), a random graph model that generalizes the configuration model. The RCM is universal with respect to local convergence among locally tree-like random graph models, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, stochastic block and configuration models. Finally, this framework enables a complete characterization of the random trees that arise as local limits of such graphs.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Submodular Maximization Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function with access to a noisy value oracle for the function instead of an exact value oracle. Similar to prior work, we assume that the noisy oracle is persistent in that multiple calls to the oracle for a specific set always return the same value. In this model, Hassidim and Singer (2017) design a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint, and Huang et al (2022) design a $(1-1/e)/2$-approximation algorithm for monotone submodular maximization subject to any arbitrary matroid constraint. In this paper, we design a meta-algorithm that allows us to take any "robust" algorithm for exact submodular maximization as a black box and transform it into an algorithm for the noisy setting while retaining the approximation guarantee. By using the meta-algorithm with the measured continuous greedy algorithm, we obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation (resp. $1/e$-approximation) for monotone (resp. non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint under noise. Furthermore, by using the meta-algorithm with the double greedy algorithm, we obtain a $1/2$-approximation for unconstrained (non-monotone) submodular maximization under noise.</description>

      <title>Unsplittable Cost Flows from Unweighted Error-Bounded Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A famous conjecture of Goemans on single-source unsplittable flows states that one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one of no higher cost, while increasing the load on any arc by at most the maximum demand. Despite extensive work on the topic, only limited progress has been made. Recently, Morell and Skutella suggested an alternative conjecture, stating that one can turn any fractional flow into an unsplittable one without changing the load on any arc by more than the maximum demand.
  We show that their conjecture implies Goemans' conjecture (with a violation of twice the maximum demand). To this end, we generalize a technique of Linhares and Swamy, used to obtain a low-cost chain-constrained spanning tree from an algorithm without cost guarantees. Whereas Linhares and Swamy's proof relies on Langrangian duality, we provide a very simple elementary proof of a generalized version, which we hope to be of independent interest. Moreover, we show how this technique can also be used in the context of the weighted ring loading problem, showing that cost-unaware approximation algorithms can be transformed into approximation algorithms with additional cost guarantees.</description>

      <title>Relative-error unateness testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of relative-error property testing of Boolean functions has been the subject of significant recent research effort [CDH+24][CPPS25a][CPPS25b] In this paper we consider the problem of relative-error testing an unknown and arbitrary $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ for the property of being a unate function, i.e. a function that is either monotone non-increasing or monotone non-decreasing in each of the $n$ input variables.
  Our first result is a one-sided non-adaptive algorithm for this problem that makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries, where $N=|f^{-1}(1)|$ is the number of satisfying assignments of the function that is being tested and the value of $N$ is given as an input parameter to the algorithm.
  Building on this algorithm, we next give a one-sided adaptive algorithm for this problem that does not need to be given the value of $N$ and with high probability makes $\tilde{O}(\log(N)/\epsilon)$ samples and queries.
  We also give lower bounds for both adaptive and non-adaptive two-sided algorithms that are given the value of $N$ up to a constant multiplicative factor. In the non-adaptive case, our lower bounds essentially match the complexity of the algorithm that we provide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every unweighted string graph $G$ has an $O(1)$-distortion planar emulator: that is, there exists an (edge-weighted) planar graph $H$ with $V(H) = V(G)$, such that every pair of vertices $(u,v)$ satisfies $\delta_G(u,v) \le \delta_H(u,v) \le O(1) \cdot \delta_G(u,v).$</description>

      <title>Non-crossing $H$-graphs: a generalization of proper interval graphs admitting FPT algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new parameterized complexity results for the FO Model Checking problem on a well-known generalization of interval and circular-arc graphs: the class of $H$-graphs, for any fixed multigraph $H$. In particular, we research how the parameterized complexity differs between two subclasses of $H$-graphs: proper $H$-graphs and non-crossing $H$-graphs, each generalizing proper interval graphs and proper circular-arc graphs. We first generalize a known result of Bonnet et al. (IPEC 2022) from interval graphs to $H$-graphs, for any (simple) forest $H$, by showing that for such $H$, the class of $H$-graphs is delineated. This implies that for every hereditary subclass ${\cal D}$ of $H$-graphs, FO Model Checking is in FPT if ${\cal D}$ has bounded twin-width and AW[$*$]-hard otherwise. As proper claw-graphs have unbounded twin-width, this means that FO Model Checking is AW[$*$]-hard for proper $H$-graphs for certain forests $H$ like the claw. In contrast, we show that even for every multigraph $H$, non-crossing $H$-graphs have bounded proper mixed-thinness and hence bounded twin-width, and thus FO Model Checking is in FPT on non-crossing $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert+\ell$, where $\Vert H \Vert$ is the size of $H$ and $\ell$ is the size of a formula. It is known that a special case of FO Model Checking, Independent Set, is $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard on $H$-graphs when parameterized by $\Vert H \Vert +k$, where $k$ is the size of a solution. We strengthen this $\mathsf{W}[1]$-hardness result to proper $H$-graphs. Hence, we solve, in two different ways, an open problem of Chaplick (Discrete Math. 2023), who asked about problems that can be solved faster for non-crossing $H$-graphs than for proper $H$-graphs.</description>

      <title>A QUBO Framework for Team Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The team formation problem assumes a set of experts and a task, where each expert has a set of skills and the task requires some skills. The objective is to find a set of experts that maximizes coverage of the required skills while simultaneously minimizing the costs associated with the experts. Different definitions of cost have traditionally led to distinct problem formulations and algorithmic solutions. We introduce the unified TeamFormation formulation that captures all cost definitions for team formation problems that balance task coverage and expert cost. Specifically, we formulate three TeamFormation variants with different cost functions using quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and we evaluate two distinct general-purpose solution methods. We show that solutions based on the QUBO formulations of TeamFormation problems are at least as good as those produced by established baselines. Furthermore, we show that QUBO-based solutions leveraging graph neural networks can effectively learn representations of experts and skills to enable transfer learning, allowing node embeddings from one problem instance to be efficiently applied to another.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Counting Linear Regions in ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions. Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and #P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.</description>
