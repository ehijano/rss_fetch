      <title>Sound Heuristic Search Value Iteration for Undiscounted POMDPs with Reachability Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are powerful models for sequential decision making under transition and observation uncertainties. This paper studies the challenging yet important problem in POMDPs known as the (indefinite-horizon) Maximal Reachability Probability Problem (MRPP), where the goal is to maximize the probability of reaching some target states. This is also a core problem in model checking with logical specifications and is naturally undiscounted (discount factor is one). Inspired by the success of point-based methods developed for discounted problems, we study their extensions to MRPP. Specifically, we focus on trial-based heuristic search value iteration techniques and present a novel algorithm that leverages the strengths of these techniques for efficient exploration of the belief space (informed search via value bounds) while addressing their drawbacks in handling loops for indefinite-horizon problems. The algorithm produces policies with two-sided bounds on optimal reachability probabilities. We prove convergence to an optimal policy from below under certain conditions. Experimental evaluations on a suite of benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in almost all cases in both probability guarantees and computation time.</description>

      <title>Local vs. Global Interpretability: A Computational Complexity Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local and global interpretability of various ML models has been studied extensively in recent years. However, despite significant progress in the field, many known results remain informal or lack sufficient mathematical rigor. We propose a framework for bridging this gap, by using computational complexity theory to assess local and global perspectives of interpreting ML models. We begin by proposing proofs for two novel insights that are essential for our analysis: (1) a duality between local and global forms of explanations; and (2) the inherent uniqueness of certain global explanation forms. We then use these insights to evaluate the complexity of computing explanations, across three model types representing the extremes of the interpretability spectrum: (1) linear models; (2) decision trees; and (3) neural networks. Our findings offer insights into both the local and global interpretability of these models. For instance, under standard complexity assumptions such as P != NP, we prove that selecting global sufficient subsets in linear models is computationally harder than selecting local subsets. Interestingly, with neural networks and decision trees, the opposite is true: it is harder to carry out this task locally than globally. We believe that our findings demonstrate how examining explainability through a computational complexity lens can help us develop a more rigorous grasp of the inherent interpretability of ML models.</description>

      <title>Automated Verification of Silq Quantum Programs using SMT Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SilVer (Silq Verification), an automated tool for verifying behaviors of quantum programs written in Silq, which is a high-level programming language for quantum computing. The goal of the verification is to ensure correctness of the Silq quantum program against user-defined specifications using SMT solvers. We introduce a programming model that is based on a quantum RAM-style computer as an interface between Silq programs and SMT proof obligations, allowing for control of quantum operations using both classical and quantum conditions. Additionally, users can employ measurement flags within the specification to easily specify conditions that measurement results require to satisfy for being a valid behavior. We provide case studies on the verification of generating entangled states and multiple oracle-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Unification with Simple Variable Restrictions and Admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to recognize admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules, relating this problem to a specific instance of the unification problem with linear constants restriction, called here "unification with simple variable restriction". It is shown that for logical systems enjoying an appropriate algebraic semantics and a finite approximation of left uniform interpolation, this unification with simple variable restriction can be reduced to standard unification. As a corollary, we obtain the decidability of admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules for many logical systems.</description>

      <title>Game Comonads &amp; Generalised Quantifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.16039v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game comonads, introduced by Abramsky, Dawar and Wang and developed by Abramsky and Shah, give an interesting categorical semantics to some Spoiler-Duplicator games that are common in finite model theory. In particular they expose connections between one-sided and two-sided games, and parameters such as treewidth and treedepth and corresponding notions of decomposition. In the present paper, we expand the realm of game comonads to logics with generalised quantifiers. In particular, we introduce a comonad graded by two parameters $n \leq k$ such that isomorphisms in the resulting Kleisli category are exactly Duplicator winning strategies in Hella's $n$-bijection game with $k$ pebbles. We define a one-sided version of this game which allows us to provide a categorical semantics for a number of logics with generalised quantifiers. We also give a novel notion of tree decomposition that emerges from the construction.</description>

      <title>Deciding the Existence of Interpolants and Definitions in First-Order Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: None of the first-order modal logics between $\mathsf{K}$ and $\mathsf{S5}$ under the constant domain semantics enjoys Craig interpolation or projective Beth definability, even in the language restricted to a single individual variable. It follows that the existence of a Craig interpolant for a given implication or of an explicit definition for a given predicate cannot be directly reduced to validity as in classical first-order and many other logics. Our concern here is the decidability and computational complexity of the interpolant and definition existence problems. We first consider two decidable fragments of first-order modal logic $\mathsf{S5}$: the one-variable fragment $\mathsf{Q^1S5}$ and its extension $\mathsf{S5}_{\mathcal{ALC}^u}$ that combines $\mathsf{S5}$ and the description logic$\mathcal{ALC}$ with the universal role. We prove that interpolant and definition existence in $\mathsf{Q^1S5}$ and $\mathsf{S5}_{\mathcal{ALC}^u}$ is decidable in coN2ExpTime, being 2ExpTime-hard, while uniform interpolant existence is undecidable. These results transfer to the two-variable fragment $\mathsf{FO^2}$ of classical first-order logic without equality. We also show that interpolant and definition existence in the one-variable fragment $\mathsf{Q^1K}$ of first-order modal logic $\mathsf{K}$ is non-elementary decidable, while uniform interpolant existence is again undecidable.</description>

      <title>Cardinality and Representation of Stone Relation Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has axiomatised the cardinality operation in relation algebras, which counts the number of edges of an unweighted graph. We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality. This results in simpler cardinality axioms also for relation algebras. We give sufficient conditions for the representability of Stone relation algebras and for Stone relation algebras to be relation algebras.</description>

      <title>Complete Game Logic with Sabotage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game Logic with sabotage ($\mathsf{GL_s}$) is introduced as a simple and natural extension of Parikh's game logic with a single additional primitive, which allows players to lay traps for the opponent. $\mathsf{GL_s}$ can be used to model infinite sabotage games, in which players can change the rules during game play. In contrast to game logic, which is strictly less expressive, $\mathsf{GL_s}$ is exactly as expressive as the modal $\mu$-calculus. This reveals a close connection between the entangled nested recursion inherent in modal fixpoint logics and adversarial dynamic rule changes characteristic for sabotage games. A natural Hilbert-style proof calculus for $\mathsf{GL_s}$ is presented and proved complete using syntactic equiexpressiveness reductions. The completeness of a simple extension of Parikh's calculus for game logic follows.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Quasi-Dense Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decidability of axiomatic extensions of the modal logic K with modal reduction principles, i.e. axioms of the form $\Diamond^{k} p \rightarrow \Diamond^{n} p$, has remained a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we make significant progress toward solving this problem and show that decidability holds for a large subclass of these logics, namely, for 'quasi-dense logics.' Such logics are extensions of K with with modal reduction axioms such that $0 &lt; k &lt; n$ (dubbed 'quasi-density axioms'). To prove decidability, we define novel proof systems for quasi-dense logics consisting of disjunctive existential rules, which are first-order formulae typically used to specify ontologies in the context of database theory. We show that such proof systems can be used to generate proofs and models of modal formulae, and provide an intricate model-theoretic argument showing that such generated models can be encoded as finite objects called 'templates.' By enumerating templates of bound size, we obtain an EXPSPACE decision procedure as a consequence.</description>
