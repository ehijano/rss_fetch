      <title>The Dark Side of Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark-field signal uncovers details beyond conventional X-ray attenuation contrast, which is especially valuable for material sciences. In particular, dark-field techniques are able to reveal structures beyond the spatial resolution of a setup. However, its implementation is yet limited to the micrometer regime. Therefore, we propose a technique to extend full-field transmission X-ray microscopy by the dark-field signal. The proposed method is based on a well-defined illumination of a beam-shaping condenser, which allows to block the bright-field by motorized apertures in the back focal plane of the objective's lens. This method offers a simple implementation and enables rapid modality changes while maintaining short scan times, making dark-field imaging widely available at the nanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Controlling the broadband enhanced light chirality with L-shaped dielectric metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherently weak chiroptical responses of natural materials limit their usage for controlling and enhancing chiral light-matter interactions. Recently, several nanostructures with subwavelength scale dimensions were demonstrated, mainly due to the advent of nanofabrication technologies, as a potential alternative to efficiently enhance chirality. However, the intrinsic lossy nature of metals and inherent narrowband response of dielectric planar thin films or metasurface structures pose severe limitations toward the practical realization of broadband and tailorable chiral systems. Here, we tackle these problems by designing all-dielectric silicon-based L-shaped optical metamaterials based on tilted nanopillars that exhibit broadband and enhanced chiroptical response in transmission operation. We use an emerging bottom-up fabrication approach, named glancing angle deposition, to assemble these dielectric metamaterials on a wafer scale. The reported strong chirality and optical anisotropic properties are controllable in terms of both amplitude and operating frequency by simply varying the shape and dimensions of the nanopillars. The presented nanostructures can be used in a plethora of emerging nanophotonic applications, such as chiral sensors, polarization filters, and spin-locked nanowaveguides.</description>

      <title>Surface variation analysis of freeform optical systems over surface frequency bands for prescribed wavefront errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface errors of freeform surfaces reflect the manufacturing complexities and significantly impact the feasibility of processing designed optical systems. With multiple degrees of freedom, freeform surfaces pose challenges in surface tolerance analysis in the field. Nevertheless, current research has neglected the influence of surface slopes on the directions of ray propagation. A sudden alteration in the surface slope will lead to a corresponding abrupt shift in the wavefront, even when the change in surface sag is minimal. Moreover, within the realm of freeform surface manufacturing, variation in surface slope across different frequency bands may give rise to unique surface variation. Within the context of this study, we propose a tolerance analysis method to analyze surface variation in freeform surfaces considering surface frequency band slopes based on real ray data. This approach utilizes real ray data to rapidly evaluate surface variation within a specified frequency band of surface slopes. Crucially, our proposed method yields the capability to obtain system surface variation with significant wavefront aberration, in contrast to previous methodologies. The feasibility and advantages of this framework are assessed by analyzing a single-mirror system with a single field and an off-axis two-mirror system. We expect to integrate the proposed methodology with freeform surface design and manufacturing, thereby expanding the scope of freeform optics.</description>

      <title>Environmental monitoring using orbital angular momentum mode decomposition enhanced machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical cavities based on epitaxial GaP on nominally (001)-oriented Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium phosphide (GaP) has recently received considerable attention as a suitable material for building photonic integrated circuits due to its remarkable optical and piezoelectric properties. Usually, GaP is grown epitaxially on III-V substrates to keep its crystallinity and later transferred to silicon wafers for further processing. Here, an alternative promising route for the fabrication of optomechanical (OM) cavities on GaP epitaxially grown on nominally (001)-oriented Si is introduced by using a two-step process consisting of a low-temperature etching of GaP followed by selective etching of the underneath silicon. The low-temperature (-30 $^o$C) during the dry-etching of GaP hinders the lateral etching rate, preserving the pattern with a deviation between the design and the pattern in the GaP layer lower than 5 %, avoiding the complex process of transferring and bonding a GaP wafer to a silicon-on-insulator wafer. To demonstrate the quality and feasibility of the proposed fabrication route, suspended OM cavities are fabricated and experimentally characterized. The cavities show optical quality factors between 10$^3$ and 10$^4$, and localized mechanical resonances at frequencies around 3.1 GHz. Both optical and mechanical resonances are close to those previously reported on crystalline GaP structures. These results suggest a simple and low-cost way to build GaP-based photonic devices directly integrated on industry-standard Si(001) photonic wafers.</description>

      <title>Optical tools for laser machining along six orders of magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview on the development and characterization of multiscale laser processing optics for versatile material modifications across more than six orders of magnitude. Starting with solutions for micromachining we present high-NA microscope objectives creating sub-wavelength material modifications on macroscopic scales with highest peak intensities. Moving on to the millimeter range, the adaptability and scalability of scanning optics is examined for large-area machining. Finally, we explore line beam optics in the meter range, evaluating their use in uniform material processing using average powers above 100kW. This study provides an insight into the design and performance characteristics of such optics and demonstrates their potential in advanced laser processing.</description>

      <title>Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy Setup with Incidence Angle Selection for Surfaces of Non-Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared Reflection Absorption Spectroscopy (IRAS) on dielectric single crystals is challenging because the optimal incidence angles for light-adsorbate interaction coincide with regions of low IR reflectivity. Here, we introduce an optimized IRAS setup that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio for non-metals. This is achieved by maximizing light throughput, and by selecting optimal incidence angles that directly impact the peak heights in the spectra. The setup uses a commercial FTIR spectrometer and is usable in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). Specifically, the design features sample illumination and collection mirrors with a high numerical aperture inside the UHV system, and an adjustable aperture to select the incidence angle range on the sample. This is important for p-polarized measurements on dielectrics, because the peaks in the spectra reverse direction at the Brewster angle (band inversion). The system components are connected precisely via a single flange, ensuring long-term stability. We studied the signal-to-noise (SNR) variation in p-polarized IRAS spectra for one monolayer of CO on TiO2(110) as a function of incidence angle range, where a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 70 was achieved at 4 cm-1 resolution in five minutes measurement time. The capabilities for s-polarization are demonstrated by measuring one monolayer D2O adsorbed on a TiO2(110) surface, where a SNR of 65 was achieved at a delta_R/R0 peak height of 1.4x10-4 in twenty minutes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Significance of Intrinsic Sensitivity and Multiple Scattering in Speckle Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speckle patterns are a powerful tool for high-precision metrology, as they allow remarkable performance in relatively simple setups. Nonetheless, researchers in this field follow rather distinct paths due to underappreciated general principles underlying speckle phenomena. Here, we advise on a universal metric of intrinsic speckle sensitivity, and on the advantages and disadvantages of multiple scattering. This will catalyse progress in speckle metrology but will also translate to other domains of disordered optics which are undergoing rapid developments at present.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Floquet Scattering Matrix for Wavefront-Shaping in Time-Periodic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of waves in time-varying media provides numerous opportunities for wave control that are unattainable with static media. In particular, Floquet systems with a periodic time modulation are currently of considerable interest. Here, we demonstrate how the scattering properties of a finite Floquet medium can be correctly described by a static Floquet scattering matrix, which satisfies a pseudo-unitary relation. This algebraic property is a consequence of the conservation of wave action for which we formulate here a continuity equation. Using this Floquet scattering matrix, we further demonstrate how it can be used to generalize also the seminal Wigner-Smith operator from static to Floquet systems. The eigenstates of the corresponding Floquet Wigner-Smith matrix are shown to be light pulses that are optimally shaped both in their spatial and temporal degrees of freedom for the optical micromanipulation of time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Towards a sensing model using random laser combined with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The previous research proves that the random laser emission reflects not only the scattering properties but also the absorption properties. The random laser is therefore considered a potential tool for optical properties sensing. Although the qualitative sensing using the random laser is extensively investigated, a quantitative measurement is still rare. In this study, a generalized mathematical quantitative model using random laser combined with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is proposed for optical sensing in turbid media. This model describes the gain effect of the active medium and the optical properties effect of the passive medium separately. Rhodamine 6G is used as the active medium. Intralipid and ink are employed to demonstrate the effect of the scattering and absorption, respectively. The peak wavelength shift of the random laser is proved to be an ideal sensing parameter for this sensing model. It is also revealed that the scaling parameters in the sensing model are interrelated and can be simplified to one. With this combined model, the direct sensing of optical properties in diverse turbid media is promising.</description>

      <title>Low Phase Noise, Record-High Power Optical Parametric Oscillator Tunable from 2.7-4.7 {\mu}m for Metrology Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the domain of optical frequency comb systems operating in the mid-infrared, extensive exploration has been undertaken regarding critical parameters such as stabilization, coherence, or spectral tunability. Despite this, certain essential parameters remain inadequately addressed, particularly concerning the light source prerequisites for advanced spectroscopy techniques operating in the 3-5 ${\mu}$m spectral region. Specifically, the necessity for high simultaneous stability of average power, spectral shape, and temporal properties, alongside requirements for excellent beam quality and high powers of several Watts, emerges for applications like cavity-enhanced Doppler-free saturation spectroscopy. Existing systems fall short of meeting these rigorous criteria. This study delves into the metrology aspects of an optical parametric oscillator system, with a particular emphasis on its suitability for powerhungry metrology applications. Notably, the highest average power reported in the 3-5 ${\mu}$m region, reaching 10.3W for the idler output at 3.1 ${\mu}$m, is achieved. Additionally, new aspects, like the analysis of idler phase noise and beam quality and the onset of higher order modes are discussed. These findings represent a significant advancement towards the realization of highly-stable, metrologygrade frequency combs in the mid-infrared, thereby facilitating precision spectroscopy techniques previously constrained by light source average powers and quality limitations.</description>

Abstract: The relentless pursuit of understanding matter at ever-finer scales has pushed optical microscopy to surpass the diffraction limit and produced the super-resolution microscopy which enables visualizing structures shorter than the wavelength of light. In the present work, we harnessed extreme ultraviolet beams to create a sub-{\mu}m grating structure, which was revealed by extreme ultraviolet structured illumination microscopy. This achievement marks the first step toward extending such a super-resolution technique into the X-ray regime, where achieving atomic-scale resolution becomes a charming possibility.</description>

      <title>Even-order optical harmonics generated from centrosymmetric-material metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of even-order optical harmonics requires noncentrosymmetric structures being conventionally observed in crystals lacking the center of inversion. In centrosymmetric systems, even-order harmonics may arise, e.g., at surfaces but such effects are usually very weak. Here we observe optical harmonics up to 4-th order generated under the normal incidence from centrosymmetric dielectric metasurfaces empowered by resonances. We design silicon metasurfaces supporting optical quasibound states in the continuum and guided-mode resonances, and demonstrate the enhancement of second-harmonic signals by over three orders of magnitude compared to nonresonant thin films. Under the optimal conditions, the brightness of the second harmonic approaches that of the third harmonic, and the 4th-order harmonic becomes detectable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework for the rational approximation of optical response functions in resonant photonic systems. The framework is based on the AAA algorithm and further allows to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenproblems and to efficiently model sensitivities. An adaptive sampling strategy exploits the predominance of resonances in the physical response. We investigate a chiral metasurface and show that the chiroptical response on parameter variations can be accurately modeled in the vicinity of the relevant resonance frequencies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phase Enabled Topological Mode Steering in Composite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Waveguide Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological boundary states localize at interfaces whenever the interface implies a change of the associated topological invariant encoded in the geometric phase. The generically present dynamic phase, however, which is energy and time dependent, has been known to be non-universal, and hence not to intertwine with any topological geometric phase. Using the example of topological zero modes in composite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (c-SSH) waveguide arrays with a central defect, we report on the selective excitation and transition of topological boundary mode based on dynamic phase-steered interferences. Our work thus provides a new knob for the control and manipulation of topological states in composite photonic devices, indicating promising applications where topological modes and their bandwidth can be jointly controlled by the dynamic phase, geometric phase, and wavelength in on-chip topological devices.</description>

      <title>Bright Coherent Ultrahigh Harmonics in the keV X-Ray Regime from Mid-Infrared Femtosecond Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation traditionally combines ~100 near-infrared laser photons, to generate bright, phase matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms adds constructively. Here we show that by guiding a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can be generated up to orders &gt; 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to &gt; 1.6 keV, allowing in-principle the generation of pulses as short as 2.5 attoseconds. The multi-atmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase matched emission also supports laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield. Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence, even though at high gas density, the recolliding electrons responsible for high harmonic generation encounter other atoms during the emission process.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of effective light transport properties in fully anisotropic media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structurally anisotropic materials are ubiquitous in several application fields, yet their accurate optical characterization remains challenging due to the lack of general models linking their scattering coefficients to the macroscopic transport observables, and the need to combine multiple measurements to retrieve their direction-dependent values. Here, we present an improved method for the experimental determination of light transport tensor coefficients from the diffusive rates measured along all three directions, based on transient transmittance measurements and a generalized Monte Carlo model. We apply our method to the characterization of light transport properties in two common anisotropic materials - polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape and paper - highlighting the magnitude of systematic deviations that are typically incurred when neglecting anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Phase-Matched Generation of Coherent Soft-X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-matched harmonic conversion of visible laser light into soft x-rays was demonstrated. The recently developed technique of guided-wave frequency conversion was used to upshift light from 800 nanometers to the range from 17 to 32 nanometers. This process increased the coherent x-ray output by factors of 10^2 to 10^3 compared to the non-phase-matched case. This source uses a small-scale (sub-millijoule) high repetition-rate laser and will enable a wide variety of new experimental investigations in linear and nonlinear x-ray science.</description>

      <title>Transmission IR Microscopy for the Quantitation of Biomolecular Mass In Live Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absolute quantity imaging of biomolecules on a single cell level is critical for measurement assurance in biosciences and bioindustries. While infrared (IR) transmission microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging modality capable of chemical quantification, its applicability to hydrated biological samples remains challenging due to the strong water absorption. We overcome this challenge by applying a solvent absorption compensation (SAC) technique to a home-built quantum cascade laser IR microscope. SAC-IR microscopy improves the chemical sensitivity considerably by adjusting the incident light intensity to pre-compensate the IR absorption by water while retaining the full dynamic range. We demonstrate the label-free chemical imaging of key biomolecules of a cell, such as protein, fatty acid, and nucleic acid, with sub-cellular spatial resolution. By imaging live fibroblast cells over twelve hours, we monitor the mass change of the three molecular species of single cells at various phases, including cell division. While the current live-cell imaging demonstration involved three wavenumbers, more wavenumber images could measure more biomolecules in live cells with higher accuracy. As a label-free method to measure absolute quantities of various molecules in a cell, SAC-IR microscopy can potentially become a standard chemical characterization tool for live cells in biology, medicine, and biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive resolution of fine scales in modes of microstructured optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive algorithm for computing eigenmodes and propagation constants of optical fibers is proposed. The algorithm is built using a dual-weighted residual error estimator. The residuals are based on the eigensystem for leaky hybrid modes obtained from Maxwell equations truncated to a finite domain after a transformation by a perfectly matched layer. The adaptive algorithm is then applied to compute practically interesting modes for multiple fiber microstructures. Emerging microstructured optical fibers are characterized by complex geometrical features in their transverse cross-section. Their leaky modes, useful for confining and propagating light in their cores, often exhibit fine scale features. The adaptive algorithm automatically captures these features without any expert input. The results also show that confinement losses of these modes are captured accurately on the adaptively found meshes.</description>

      <title>Engineering flat bands in twisted-bilayer graphene away from the magic angle with chiral optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, $\theta \approx 1.05^{\circ}$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately $0.8^{\circ}&lt;\theta&lt;1.3^{\circ}$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with a gap closing at the $\Gamma$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated flat bands with Chern number equal to $0$. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.</description>

      <title>Light Emission and Conductance Fluctuations in Electrically Driven and Plasmonically Enhanced Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrically connected and plasmonically enhanced molecular junctions combine the optical functionalities of high field confinement and enhancement (cavity function), and of high radiative efficiency (antenna function) with the electrical functionalities of molecular transport. Such combined optical and electrical probes have proven useful for the fundamental understanding of metal-molecule contacts and contribute to the development of nanoscale optoelectronic devices including ultrafast electronics and nanosensors. Here, we employ a self-assembled metal-molecule-metal junction with a nanoparticle bridge to investigate correlated fluctuations in conductance and tunneling-induced light emission at room temperature. Despite the presence of hundreds of molecules in the junction, the electrical conductance and light emission are both highly sensitive to atomic-scale fluctuations -- a phenomenology reminiscent of picocavities observed in Raman scattering and of luminescence blinking from photo-excited plasmonic junctions. Discrete steps in conductance associated with fluctuating emission intensities through the multiple plasmonic modes of the junction are consistent with a finite number of randomly localized, point-like sources dominating the optoelectronic response. Contrasting with these microscopic fluctuations, the overall plasmonic and electronic functionalities of our devices feature long-term survival at room temperature and under an electrical bias of a few volts, allowing for measurements over several months.</description>
