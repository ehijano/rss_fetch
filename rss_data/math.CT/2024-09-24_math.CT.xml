      <title>How the convex space-metric space compatability condition determines Giry algebras on Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two probability monads defined on the category of Polish spaces depending upon whether one uses measurable functions or continuous functions for the morphisms. In the first case the monad is called the $\mathcal{G}$-monad on standard Borel spaces, while the latter case yields the $\mathscr{P}$-monad on the category of Polish spaces. Given an arbitrary Polish space $X$ with a superconvex space structure we show there exist a $\mathcal{G}$-algebra ($\mathscr{P}$-algebra) on $X$ when $X$ satisfies the convex space-metric space compatability condition $d_X(p x + (1-p) z, p y + (1-p) z) \le p\, d_X(x,y)$ for all points $x,y,z$ in $X$ and all $p \in [0,1]$.
  Those spaces which satisfy the compatability condition have a coseparator which allows us to establish the existence of the $\mathcal{G}$-algebras and $\mathscr{P}$-algebras. These algebras are the expectation operators $\mathcal{G}X \xrightarrow{\mathbb{E}_{\bullet}(\mathbf{1}_X)} X$ which come in two versions, measurable and continuous. The only distinction between $\mathcal{G}$-algebras and $\mathcal{P}$-algebras are the existence of the countably discrete spaces for which there exist no continuous expectation map because discrete spaces are disconnected.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in the cubical Joyal model structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of the cubical Joyal model structures on cubical sets by means of a combinatorial construction which allows for convenient comparisons between categories of cubical sets with and without symmetries. In particular, we prove that the cubical Joyal model structures on categories of cubical sets with connections are cartesian monoidal. Our techniques also allow us to prove that the geometric product of cubical sets (with or without connections) is symmetric up to natural weak equivalence in the cubical Joyal model structure, and to obtain induced model structures for $(\infty,1)$-categories on cubical sets with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Non-Cartesian Guarded Recursion with Daggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guarded recursion is a framework allowing for a formalisation of streams in classical programming languages. The latter take their semantics in cartesian closed categories. However, some programming paradigms do not take their semantics in a cartesian setting; this is the case for concurrency, reversible and quantum programming for example. In this paper, we focus on reversible programming through the prism of dagger categories, which are categories that contain an involutive operator on morphisms. After presenting classical guarded recursion, we show how to introduce this framework into dagger categories. Given a dagger category, we build categories shown to be suitable for guarded recursion in multiple ways, via enrichment and fixed point theorems. Finally, we show that our construction is suitable as a model of reversible programming languages, such as symmetric pattern-matching.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebras in Grothendieck-Verdier categories, rigidity, and vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative algebra in a braided monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$; e.g., $A$ could be an extension of a vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ in a category $\mathcal{C}$ of $V$-modules. We study when the category $\mathcal{C}_A$ of $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$ and its subcategory $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ of local modules inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}$, and then we find conditions for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}_A$ to inherit rigidity from $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$. First, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a braided finite tensor category and prove rigidity of $\mathcal{C}_A$ and $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ under conditions based on criteria of Etingof-Ostrik for $A$ to be an exact algebra in $\mathcal{C}$. As a corollary, we show that if $A$ is a simple $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$-graded VOA with a strongly rational vertex operator subalgebra $V$, then $A$ is strongly rational, without requiring the categorical dimension of $A$ as a $V$-module to be non-zero. Next, we assume $\mathcal{C}$ is a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e., $\mathcal{C}$ admits a weaker duality structure than rigidity. We first prove $\mathcal{C}_A$ is also a Grothendieck-Verdier category. Using this, we prove that if $\mathcal{C}_A^{\text{loc}}$ is rigid, then so is $\mathcal{C}$ under conditions such as a mild non-degeneracy assumption on $\mathcal{C}$, an assumption that every simple object of $\mathcal{C}_A$ is local, and that induction from $\mathcal{C}$ to $\mathcal{C}_A$ commutes with duality. These conditions are motivated by free field-like VOA extensions $V\subseteq A$ where $A$ is often an indecomposable $V$-module, so our result will make it more feasible to prove rigidity for many vertex algebraic monoidal categories. In a follow-up work, our result will be used to prove rigidity of the category of weight modules for the simple affine VOA of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theories of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories as universal fixed points with respect to enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00442v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that both the $\infty$-category of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories with inductively defined equivalences, and with coinductively defined equivalences, satisfy universal properties with respect to weak enrichment in the sense of Gepner and Haugseng. In particular, we prove that $(\infty, \infty)$-categories with coinductive equivalences form a terminal object in the $\infty$-category of fixed points for enrichment, and that $(\infty, \infty)$-categories with inductive equivalences form an initial object in the subcategory of locally presentable fixed points. To do so, we develop an analogue of Ad\'amek's construction of free endofunctor algebras in the $\infty$-categorical setting. We prove that $(\infty, \infty)$-categories with coinductive equivalences form a terminal coalgebra with respect to weak enrichment, and $(\infty, \infty)$-categories with inductive equivalences form an initial algebra with respect to weak enrichment.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Lambek invariants (introduced by Joachim Lambek in 1964) in the context of semiexact and homological categories in the sense of Grandis. We generalize the Lambek isomorphism theorem to semiexact and homological categories. Throughout the text, for completeness we give proofs of some lemmas which are known in the additive case for the case of semiexact and homological categories.</description>

      <title>The $(\infty,2)$-category of internal $(\infty,1)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study the $(\infty,2)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{\infty}(\mathcal{C})$ of $(\infty,1)$-categories internal to a general $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$ via an associated externalization construction. In the first part, we show various formal closure properties of $\mathbf{Cat}_{\infty}(\mathcal{C})$ regarding limits, tensors, cotensors and internal mapping objects under the assumption of various suitable closure properties of $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, we show that $\mathbf{Cat}_{\infty}(\mathcal{C})$ defines a cartesian closed full sub-$\infty$-cosmos of the $\infty$-cosmos $\mathbf{Fun}(\mathcal{C}^{op},\mathbf{Cat}_{\infty})$ of $\mathcal{C}$-indexed $(\infty,1)$-categories under suitable assumptions on $\mathcal{C}$. We furthermore characterize the objects of $\mathbf{Cat}_{\infty}(\mathcal{C})$ by means of a Yoneda lemma that expresses indexed diagrams of internal shape over $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of an $(\infty,1)$-categorical totalization. In the second part, we relate the general theory developed to this point to results in the model categorical literature. We show that every model category $\mathbb{M}$ gives rise to a ''hands-on'' $\infty$-cosmos $\mathbf{Cat}_{\infty}(\mathbb{M})$ (of not-necessarily cofibrant objects) directly by restriction of the Reedy model structure on $\mathbb{M}^{\Delta^{op}}$. We then define an according right derived model categorical externalization functor, and use it to show that the $(\infty,1)$-categorical and the model categorical constructions correspond to one another whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is presentable and $\mathbb{M}$ is a suitable presentation thereof.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a functorial presentation of the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories for all $-2 \leq n\leq\infty$ and $0 \leq r\leq n+2$ based on complete Segal space objects. In this definition, the equivalences of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories are defined inductively, so we also provide a localisation at the coinductive equivalences to define the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories as well. We prove that the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories and the $(\infty, 1)$-category of sheaves of $\omega$-categories both define distributors over the underlying topos of sheaves of spaces. Moreover, we show that these distributors define terminal and initial fixed points with respect to the construction of complete Segal space objects in a distributor. We conclude with a sheafification result: the category of sheaves of $(n, r)$-categories over a site $\mathscr{C}$ can be presented as a strongly reflective localisation of $\mathbf{Fun}(\mathscr{C}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Cat}_{(n, r)})$, where the localisation functor preserves fibre products over $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathscr{C})$, with the analogous result also holding for sheaves of $\omega$-categories.</description>

Abstract: Working within enriched category theory, we further develop the use of soundness, introduced by Ad\'amek, Borceux, Lack, and Rosick\'y for ordinary categories. In particular we investigate: (1) the theory of locally $\Phi$-presentable $\mathcal V$-categories for a sound class $\Phi$, (2) the problem of whether every $\Phi$-accessible $\mathcal V$-category is $\Psi$-accessible, for given sound classes $\Phi\subseteq\Psi$, and (3) a notion of $\Phi$-ary equational theory whose $\mathcal V$-categories of models characterize algebras for $\Phi$-ary monads on $\mathcal V$.</description>

      <title>Gray categories with duals and their diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:1211.0529v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric and algebraic properties of Gray categories with duals are investigated by means of a diagrammatic calculus. The diagrams are three-dimensional stratifications of a cube, with regions, surfaces, lines and vertices labelled by Gray category data. These can be viewed as a generalisation of ribbon diagrams. The Gray categories present two types of duals, which are extended to functors of strict tricategories with natural isomorphisms, and correspond directly to symmetries of the diagrams. It is shown that these functors can be strictified so that the symmetries of a cube are realised exactly. A new condition on Gray categories with duals called the spatial condition is defined. A class of diagrams for which the evaluation for spatial Gray categories is invariant under homeomorphisms is exhibited. This relation between the geometry of the diagrams and structures in the Gray categories proves useful in computations and has potential applications in topological quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08656v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents categorical formulations of Turing, Medvedev, Muchnik, and Weihrauch reducibilities in Computability Theory, utilizing Lawvere doctrines. While the first notions lend themselves to a smooth categorical presentation, essentially dualizing the traditional idea of realizability doctrines, Weihrauch reducibility and its extensions to represented and multi-represented spaces require a separate investigation. Our abstract analysis of these concepts highlights a shared characteristic among all these reducibilities. Specifically, we demonstrate that all these doctrines stemming from computability concepts can be proven to be instances of completions of quantifiers for doctrines, analogous to what occurs for doctrines for realizability. As a corollary of these results, we will be able to formally compare Weihrauch reducibility with the dialectica doctrine constructed from a doctrine representing Turing degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neeman shows that the completion of a triangulated category with respect to a good metric yields a triangulated category. We compute completions of discrete cluster categories with respect to metrics induced by internal t-structures. In particular, for a coaisle metric this yields a new triangulated category which can be interpreted as a topological completion of the associated combinatorial model. Moreover, we show that the completion of any triangulated category with respect to an internal aisle metric is a thick subcategory of the triangulated category itself.</description>
