      <title>Trace type Orlicz spaces and analysis of Orlicz spaces by Lebesgue exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we analyze the Lebesgue exponents $p_\Phi$ and $q_\Phi$, and show that there exist Young functions $\Psi$ with $p_\Phi &lt; p_\Psi &lt; \infty$ and $1&lt;q_\Psi &lt; q_\Phi$ but $L^\Psi = L^\Phi$. This type of construction is ultimately used to improve upon the inclusions $L^{p_\Phi}\cap L^{q_\Phi}\subseteq L^\Phi \subseteq L^{p_\Phi} + L^{q_\Phi}$. Investigations into the trace type Orlicz spaces $L^{\Phi,\Phi}$ are included. We find that $L^{\Phi,\Phi} \subseteq L^\Phi$ if $\Phi$ is a submultiplicative Young function, and that reversed inclusions hold if $\Phi$ is supermultiplicative.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of screened particles towards equi-spaced ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the dynamics - driven by the gradient flow of negative fractional seminorms - of empirical measures towards equi-spaced ground states.
  Specifically, we consider periodic empirical measures $\mu$ on the real line that are screened by the Lebesgue measure, i.e., with $\mu-d x$ having zero average. To each of these measures $\mu$ we associate a {(periodic)} function $u$ satisfying $u'= d x - \mu$. For $s\in (0,\frac 12)$ we introduce energy functionals $\mathcal E^s(\mu)$ that can be understood as the density of the $s$-Gagliardo seminorm of $u$ per unit length. Since for $s\ge \frac 12$, the $s$-Gagliardo seminorms are infinite on functions with jumps, some regularization procedure is needed: For $s\in[\frac 12,1)$ we define $\mathcal E_\e^s(\mu):= \mathcal E^s(\mu_\e)$, where $\mu_\varepsilon$ is obtained by mollifying $\mu$ on scale $\varepsilon$.
  We prove that the minimizers of $\mathcal E^s$ and $\mathcal E_\varepsilon^s$ are the equi-spaced configurations of particles with lattice spacing equal to one. Then, we prove the exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient flows to the equi-spaced steady states. Finally, although for $s\in[\frac 12 ,1)$ the energy functionals $\mathcal E_\varepsilon^s$ blow up as $\varepsilon\to 0$, their gradients are uniformly bounded (with respect to $\varepsilon$), so that the corresponding trajectories converge, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, to the gradient flow solution of a suitable renormalized energy.</description>

      <title>Frame bound, spectral gap and Plus space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between frame bounds and spectral gaps. By introducing the notion of \emph{essential minimum(maximal) spectral gap}, we provide a local characterization of Landau's theorem \cite{Lan67}. As an application, we resolve the spectrality additive measures of Lebesgue type, conclusively answering an open question on the spectrality of Plus spaces originally raised by Lai, Liu, Prince \cite{LLP21} and further studied by Ai, Lu, Zhou \cite{ALZ23} and Kolountzakis, Wu \cite{KW25}.</description>

      <title>A Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Theorem for smooth valuations on convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous dually epi-translation invariant valuations on convex functions are characterized in terms of the Fourier-Laplace transform of the associated Goodey-Weil distributions. This description is used to obtain integral representations of the smooth vectors of the natural representation of the group of translations on the space of these valuations. As an application, a complete classification of all closed and affine invariant subspaces is established, yielding density results for valuations defined in terms of mixed Monge-Amp\`ere operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discrete regularity estimates for a broad class of temporal numerical schemes for parabolic stochastic evolution equations. We provide a characterization of discrete stochastic maximal $\ell^p$-regularity in terms of its continuous counterpart, thereby establishing a unified framework that yields numerous new discrete regularity results. Moreover, as a consequence of the continuous-time theory, we establish several important properties of discrete stochastic maximal regularity such as extrapolation in the exponent $p$ and with respect to a power weight. Furthermore, employing the $H^\infty$-functional calculus, we derive a powerful discrete maximal estimate in the trace space norm $D_A(1-\frac1p,p)$ for $p \in [2,\infty)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of generalized boundary triples and their Weyl functions from extension theory of symmetric operators to adjoint pairs of operators, and we provide criteria on the boundary parameters to induce closed operators with a nonempty resolvent set. The abstract results are applied to Schr\"odinger operators with complex $L^p$-potentials on bounded and unbounded Lipschitz domains with compact boundaries.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint operators in Z-stable C$^*$-algebras with prescribed spectral data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the variety of spectral measures that are induced by quasitraces on the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator in a simple separable unital and Z-stable C$^*$-algebra. This amounts to a continuous map from the simplex of quasitraces of the C$^*$-algebra into regular Borel probability measures on the spectrum of the operator under consideration. In the case of a connected spectrum this data determines the unitary equivalence class of the operator, and may be reduced to to the case of an operator with spectrum equal to the closed unit interval. We prove that any continuous map from the simplex of quasitraces with the topology of pointwise convergence into regular faithful Borel probability measures on $[0,1]$ with the Levy-Prokhorov metric is realized by some self-adjoint operator in the C$^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Collapse of the $ \mathfrak{sl}_2 $-triple associated to the $ (k, a) $-generalized Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ben Sa\"id--Kobayashi--{\O}rsted introduced a family of $ \mathfrak{sl}_2 $-triples of differential operators $ \mathbb{H}_{k, a} $, $ \mathbb{E}^+_{k, a} $ and $ \mathbb{E}^-_{k, a} $ on $ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \{0\} $ indexed by a Dunkl parameter $ k $ and a deformation parameter $ a \neq 0 $. In the present paper, we fix $ k = 0 $ and study the behavior as the parameter $ a $ approaches $ 0 $. In this limit, the Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_a = \operatorname{span}_{\mathbb{R}} \{\mathbb{H}_a, \mathbb{E}^+_a, \mathbb{E}^-_a\} \cong \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R}) $ degenerates into a three-dimensional commutative Lie algebra $ \mathfrak{g}_0 $, and its spectral properties change. We describe the simultaneous spectral decomposition for $ \mathfrak{g}_0 $, and discuss formulas for operator semigroups with infinitesimal generators in $ \mathfrak{g}_0 $. In particular, we describe the integral kernel of $ \exp(z \lvert x \rvert^2 \Delta) $ as an infinite series, which, in some low-dimensional cases, can be expressed in a closed form using the theta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a localization concept for operator-valued frames, where the quality of localization is measured by the associated operator-valued Gram matrix belonging to some suitable Banach algebra. We prove that intrinsic localization of an operator-valued frame is preserved by its canonical dual. Moreover, we show that the series associated to the perfect reconstruction of an operator-valued frame converges not only in the underlying Hilbert space, but also in a whole class of associated (quasi-)Banach spaces. Finally, we apply our results to irregular Gabor g-frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of disjoint Ces$\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclic operators. First, the definition of disjoint Ces$\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclic operators is provided, and disjoint Ces$\grave{a}$ro-Hypercyclicity Criterion is proposed. Later, two methods are used to prove that operators satisfying this criterion possess disjoint Ces$\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclicity. Finally, this paper further investigates weighted shift operators and provides detailed characterizations of the weight sequences for disjoint Ces$\grave{a}$ro-hypercyclic unilateral and bilateral weighted shift operators on sequence spaces.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix of the XXZ chain in the massless regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free energy per lattice site of a quantum spin chain in the thermodynamic limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally, accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We rigorously establish the existence, uniqueness and characterise the form of the solutions to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.</description>

Abstract: We show that the noncommutative differential geometry of quantum projective spaces is compatible with Rieffel's theory of compact quantum metric spaces. This amounts to a detailed investigation of the Connes metric coming from the unital spectral triple introduced by D'Andrea and Dabrowski. In particular, we establish that the Connes metric metrizes the weak-* topology on the state space of quantum projective space. This generalizes previous work by the second author and Aguilar regarding spectral metrics on the standard Podles spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative metric geometry of quantum circle bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate quantum circle bundles from the point of view of compact quantum metric spaces. The raw input data is a circle action on a unital $C^*$-algebra together with a quantum metric of spectral geometric origin on the fixed point algebra. Under a few extra conditions on the spectral subspaces we show that the spectral geometric data on the base algebra can be lifted to the total algebra. Notably, the lifted spectral geometry is independent of the choice of frames and is permitted to interact with the total algebra via a twisted derivation. Under these conditions, it is explained how to assemble our data into a quantum metric on the total algebra in a way which unifies and generalizes a couple of results in the literature relating to crossed products by the integers and to quantum $SU(2)$. We apply our ideas to the higher Vaksman-Soibelman quantum spheres and endow them with quantum metrics arising from $q$-geometric data. In this context, the twist is enforced by the structure of the Drinfeld-Jimbo deformation arising from the Lie algebra of the special unitary group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study nonmaximal representations of surface groups in PU(2,1). In genus large enough, we show the existence of convex-cocompact representations of non-maximal Toledo invariant admitting a unique equivariant minimal surface, which is holomorphic and almost totally geodesic. These examples can be obtained for any Toledo invariant of the form 2-2g +2/3 d, provided g is large compared to d. When d is not divisible by 3, this yields examples of convex-cocompact representations in PU(2,1) which do not lift to SU(2,1)</description>

      <title>Some lower bounds for optimal sampling recovery of functions with mixed smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there was a substantial progress in the problem of sampling recovery on function classes with mixed smoothness. Mostly, it has been done by proving new and sometimes optimal upper bounds for both linear sampling recovery and for nonlinear sampling recovery. In this paper we address the problem of lower bounds for the optimal rates of nonlinear sampling recovery.
  In the case of linear recovery one can use the well developed theory of estimating the Kolmogorov and linear widths for establishing some lower bounds for the optimal rates. In the case of nonlinear recovery we cannot use the above approach. It seems like the only technique, which is available now, is based on some simple observations. We demonstrate how these observations can be used.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition is widely used in modal analysis, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and resolvent analysis, to extract key features from complex problems. SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by calculating the derivatives of singular values with respect to the snapshot matrix derived from the POD of a large dataset for a laminar-turbulent transitional flow over a flat plate, sourced from the John Hopkins turbulence database.</description>
