      <title>Cohomology of Moduli Space of Multiscale Differentials in Genus 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the rational cohomology ring of moduli space of multiscale differentials in genus 0 is generated by the boundary divisors. The main idea is the technique of the Chow-K\"unneth generation Property and the observation that the intersection of a collection of boundary divisors in the moduli space is irreducible. We observe that the relations between the boundary strata in cohomology are generated by the pullback of the WDVV relations and the relations between the torus-invariant subvarieties in the fiber over $\overline{M}_{0,n}$. We also characterize the cases in which the moduli space is a smooth variety, and in these cases, we prove that the integral cohomology ring is generated by the boundary divisors.</description>

      <title>Multi-rigidity of Schubert classes in partial flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the multi-rigidity problem in rational homogeneous spaces. A Schubert class is called multi-rigid if every multiple of it can only be represented by a union of Schubert varieties. We prove the multi-rigidity of Schubert classes in rational homogeneous spaces. In particular, we characterize the multi-rigid Schubert classes in partial flag varieties of type A, B and D. Moreover, for a general rational homogeneous space $G/P$, we deduce the rigidity and multi-rigidity from the corresponding generalized Grassmannians (correspond to maximal parabolics). When $G$ is semi-simple, we also deduce the rigidity and multi-rigidity from the simple cases.</description>

      <title>Cactus scheme, catalecticant minors, and scheme theoretic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-th cactus variety of a subvariety $X$ in a projective space generalizes the $r$-th secant variety of $X$ and it is defined using linear spans of finite subschemes of $X$ of degree $r$. One of its original purposes was to study the vanishing sets of catalecticant minors. In this article, we equip the cactus variety with a scheme structure, via ``relative linear spans'' of families of finite schemes over a potentially non-reduced base. In this way, we are able to study the vanishing scheme of the catalecticant minors. For a sufficiently high degree Veronese variety, we show that $r$-th cactus scheme and the zero scheme of appropriate catalecticant minors agree on a dense open subset which is the complement of the $(r-1)$-th cactus variety (or scheme). This article is the first part of a series. In the follow-up, as an application, we can describe the singular locus of (in particular) secant varieties to high degree Veronese varieties in terms of singularities of the Hilbert scheme. We will also generalize the result to high degree Veronese reembeddings of other varieties and schemes.</description>

      <title>Instanton Sheaves on Ruled Fano 3-folds of Picard Rank 2 and Index 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rank 2 $h$-instanton sheaves on projective threefolds. We demonstrate that any orientable rank 2, non-locally free $h$-instanton sheaf with defect 0 on a threefold can be obtained as an elementary transformation of a locally free $h$-instanton sheaf. Our focus then shifts to ruled Fano threefolds of Picard rank 2 and index 1, of which there are five deformation classes. We establish the existence of orientable rank 2 $h$-instanton bundles on such varieties. Additionally, we prove the existence of Ulrich bundles on such varieties, which correspond to $h$-instanton sheaves of minimum charge.</description>

      <title>On a Galois cover of the Hermitian curve of genus $\mathfrak{g}=\frac{1}{8}(q-1)^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of algebraic curves with many points over a finite field, a well known general problem is to understanding better the properties of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-maximal curves whose genera fall in the higher part of the spectrum of the genera of all $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-maximal curves. This problem is still open for genera smaller than $ \lfloor \frac{1}{6}(q^2-q+4) \rfloor$. In this paper we consider the case of $\mathfrak{g}=\frac{1}{8}(q-1)^2$ where $q\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ and the curve is the Galois cover of the Hermitian curve w.r.t to a cyclic automorphism group of order $4$. Our contributions concern Frobenius embedding, Weierstrass semigroups and automorphism groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give four examples of pairs of (conjecturally irrational) cubic fourfolds with birationally equivalent (and in some cases isomorphic) Fano varieties of lines. Two of our examples, which are special families in $C_{12}$, provide new examples of Fourier-Mukai partners which we show are birationally equivalent. We discuss and present examples explaining how various types of equivalence for cubic fourfolds are related.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The higher-rank numerical range is a convex compact set generalizing the classical numerical range of a square complex matrix, first appearing in the study of quantum error correction. We will discuss some of the real algebraic and convex geometry of these sets, including a generalization of Kippenhahn's theorem, and describe an algorithm to explicitly calculate the higher-rank numerical range of a given matrix.</description>

      <title>T-dual branes on hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This submission is a PhD dissertation. Kapustin and Witten conjectured that there is a mirror symmetry relation between the hyperk\"ahler structures on certain Higgs bundle moduli spaces. As a consequence, they conjecture an equivalence between categories of BBB and BAA-branes. At the classical level, this mirror symmetry is given by T-duality between semi-flat hyperk\"ahler structures on algebraic integrable systems. In this thesis, we investigate the T-duality relation between hyperk\"ahler structures and the corresponding branes on affine torus bundles. We use the techniques of generalized geometry to show that semi-flat hyperk\"ahler structures are T-dual on algebraic integrable systems. We also describe T-duality for generalized branes. Motivated by Fourier-Mukai transform we upgrade the T-duality between generalized branes to T-duality of submanifolds endowed with U(1)-bundles and connections. This T-duality in the appropriate context specializes to T-duality between BBB and BAA-branes.</description>

      <title>Microscopic stability thresholds and constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we directly prove that if the limit of microscopic stability thresholds introduced by Berman for a polarized manifold satisfies some condition, then there exists a unique constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler metric. This is an analogue of K.Zhang's result which is proved by the delta-invariant introduced by Fujita-Odaka. This work is motivated by Berman's result which shows that if a Fano manifold is uniformly Gibbs stable, then there exists a unique K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric, without uniform K-stability. We also give some sufficient conditions of the existence of a constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler cone metric.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility, Smoothness, and Connectivity of Realization Spaces of Matroids and Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the realization spaces of matroids and hyperplane arrangements. First, we define the notion of naive dimension for the realization space of matroids and compare it with the expected dimension and the algebraic dimension, exploring the conditions under which these dimensions coincide. Next, we introduce the family of inductively connected matroids and investigate their realization spaces, establishing that they are smooth, irreducible, and isomorphic to a Zariski open subset of a complex space with a known dimension. Furthermore, we present an explicit procedure for computing their defining equations. As corollaries, we identify families of hyperplane arrangements whose moduli spaces are connected. Finally, we apply our results to study the rigidity of matroids. Rigidity, which involves matroids with a unique realization under projective transformations, is key to understanding the connectivity of the moduli spaces of the corresponding hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the average number of surjections from class groups of quadratic function fields over $\mathbb F_q(t)$ onto finite odd order groups $H$, once $q$ is sufficiently large. These yield the first known moments of these class groups, as predicted by the Cohen--Lenstra heuristics, apart from the case $H = \mathbb Z/3\mathbb Z$. The key input to this result is a topological one, where we compute the stable rational homology groups of Hurwitz spaces associated to non-splitting conjugacy classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1904.07352v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Lurie and Pridham establishes a correspondence between formal moduli problems and differential graded Lie algebras in characteristic zero, thereby formalising a well-known principle in deformation theory. We introduce a variant of differential graded Lie algebras, called partition Lie algebras, in arbitrary characteristic. We then explicitly compute the homotopy groups of free algebras, which parametrise operations. Finally, we prove generalisations of the Lurie-Pridham correspondence classifying formal moduli problems via partition Lie algebras over an arbitrary field, as well as over a complete local base.</description>

      <title>Newton--Okounkov bodies and minimal models for cluster varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a (partial) minimal model of a scheme $V$ with a cluster structure. Under natural assumptions, for every choice of seed we associate a Newton--Okounkov body to every divisor on $Y$ supported on $Y \setminus V$ and show that these Newton--Okounkov bodies are positive sets in the sense of Gross, Hacking, Keel and Kontsevich \cite{GHKK}. This construction essentially reverses the procedure in loc. cit. that generalizes the polytope construction of a toric variety to the framework of cluster varieties.
  In a closely related setting, we consider cases where $Y$ is a projective variety whose universal torsor $\text{UT}_Y$ is a partial minimal model of a scheme with a cluster structure of type $\mathcal A$. If the theta functions parametrized by the integral points of the associated superpotential cone form a basis of the ring of algebraic functions on $\text{UT}_Y$ and the action of the torus $T_{\text{Pic}(Y)^*}$ on $\text{UT}_Y$ is compatible with the cluster structure, then for every choice of seed we associate a Newton--Okounkov body to every line bundle on $Y$. We prove that any such Newton--Okounkov body is a positive set and that $Y$ is a minimal model of a quotient of a cluster $\mathcal A$-variety by the action of a torus.
  Our constructions lead to the notion of the intrinsic Newton--Okounkov body associated to a boundary divisor in a partial minimal model of a scheme with a cluster structure. This provides a wide class of examples of Newton-Okoukov bodies exhibiting a wall-crossing phenomenon in the sense of Escobar--Harada \cite{EH20}.
  This approach includes the partial flag varieties that arise as minimal models of cluster varieties. For the case of Grassmannians, our approach recovers, up to interesting unimodular equivalences, the Newton--Okounkov bodies constructed by Rietsch--Williams in \cite{RW}.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Calabi-Yau varieties with isolated log canonical singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with canonical singularities has highlighted the key role played by the higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities, and especially by the so-called $k$-liminal singularities for $k\ge 1$. The goal of this paper is to show that certain aspects of this study extend naturally to the $0$-liminal case as well, i.e. to Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with Gorenstein log canonical, but not canonical, singularities. In particular, we show the existence of first order smoothings of $Y$ in the case of isolated $0$-liminal hypersurface singularities, and extend Namikawa's unobstructedness theorem for deformations of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds $Y$ with canonical singularities to the case where $Y$ has an isolated $0$-liminal lci singularity under suitable hypotheses. Finally, we describe an interesting series of examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To a complex polynomial function $f$ with arbitrary singularities we associate the number of Morse points in a general linear Morsification $f_{t} := f - t\ell$. We produce computable algebraic formulas in terms of invariants of $f$ for the numbers of stratwise Morse trajectories which abut, as $t\to 0$, to some point of the space or at infinity.</description>

      <title>Rigid Schubert classes in partial flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schubert class is called rigid if it can only be represented by Schubert varieties. The rigid Schubert classes have been classified in Grassmannians and orthogonal Grassmannians. In this paper, we study the rigidity problem in partial flag varieties (type A) and orthogonal partial flag varieties (type B and type D). In particular, we give numerical conditions that ensure a Schubert class is rigid.</description>

      <title>Log-Lipschitz and H\"older regularity imply smoothness for complex analytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove metric analogues, in any dimension and in any co-dimension, of the famous Theorem of Mumford on smoothness of normal surfaces and the beautiful Theorem of Ramanujam that gives a topological characterization of $\mathbb{C}^2$ as an algebraic surface. For instance, we prove that a complex analytic set that is log-Lipschitz regular at 0 (i.e., a complex analytic set that has a neighbourhood of the origin which bi-log-Lipschitz homeomorphic to an Euclidean ball) must be smooth at 0. We prove even more, we prove that if a complex analytic set $X$ such that, for each $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$, $(X,0)$ and $(\mathbb{R}^k,0)$ are bi-$\alpha$-H\"older homeomorphic, then $X$ must be smooth at 0. These results generalize the Lipschitz Regularity Theorem, which says that a Lipschitz regular complex analytic set must be smooth. Global versions of these results are also presented here and, in particular, we obtain a characterization of an affine linear subspace as a pure-dimensional entire complex analytic set.</description>

      <title>Line bundles on Contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$ via Conformal Block Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using representations of vertex operator algebras, we describe the line bundles on a wide range of contractions of $\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}$, the moduli space of stable $n$-pointed rational curves, by proving a stronger version of the contraction theorem for these morphisms. These include the celebrated constructions of Kapranov, Keel, and Knudsen. Our main result suggests that while many so-called F-curves are not $K_X$-negative, they exhibit behavior similar to $K_X$-negative curves. This reveals for instance, a distinguished property of Knudsen's construction $f_{\text{Knu}}:\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n}\to \overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-1}\times_{\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-2}}\overline{\rm{M}}_{0,n-1}$, allowing for the classification of all possible factorizations of $f_{\text{Knu}}$, as well as further applications, and generalizations.</description>

      <title>On the torsion locus of the Ceresa normal function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the positive-dimensional part of the torsion locus of the Ceresa normal function in $\mathcal{M}_g$ is not Zariski dense when $g\geq 3$. Moreover, it has only finitely many components with generic Mumford-Tate group equal to $\mathrm{GSp}_{2g}$; these components are defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, and their union is closed under the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb Q)$. More generally, we study the distribution of the torsion locus of arbitrary admissible normal functions.</description>

      <title>Heights and periods of algebraic cycles in families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Beilinson-Bloch heights and Abel-Jacobian periods of homologically trivial Chow cycles in families. For the Beilinson-Bloch heights, we show that for any $g\ge 3$, we can construct a Zariski open dense subset $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{amp}}$ of $\mathcal{M}_g$, the coarse moduli of curves of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, such that the heights of Ceresa cycles and Gross-Schoen cycles over $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{amp}}$ have a lower bound and satisfy the Northcott property. For the Abel-Jacobi periods, we prove that the Ceresa and Gross-Schoen cycle over every non-$\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$ point in $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{amp}}$ is non-torsion.
  We also prove results and make conjectures for any family $X \rightarrow S$ of smooth projective varieties and homologically trivial cocycles $Z$ defined over a number field. Using the Betti strata, we construct a Zariski open subset $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ of $S_{\mathbb{C}}$ over which $Z_s$ is non-torsion for all transcendental points $s$ and prove a criterion for $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ to be dense. We conjecture the rationality of $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ and also conjecture that $S^{\mathrm{amp}}$ is precisely the open locus on which the Beilinson-Bloch height of $Z_s$ has a lower bound and satisfies the Northcott property.</description>

      <title>Classifying Fano 4-folds with a rational fibration onto a 3-fold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study smooth, complex Fano 4-folds X with a rational contraction onto a 3-fold, namely a rational map X--&gt;Y that factors as a sequence of flips X--&gt;X' followed by a surjective morphism X'-&gt;Y with connected fibers, where Y is normal, projective, and dim Y=3. We show that if X has a rational contraction onto a 3-fold and X is not a product of del Pezzo surfaces, then the Picard number rho(X) of X is at most 9; this bound is sharp. As an application, we show that every Fano 4-fold X with rho(X)=12 is isomorphic to a product of surfaces, thus improving the result by the first named author that shows the same for rho(X)&gt;12. We also give a classification result for Fano 4-folds X, not products of surfaces, having a "special" rational contraction X--&gt;Y with dim Y=3, rho(X)-rho(Y)=2, and rho(X)&gt;6; we show that there are only three possible families. Then we prove that the first family exists if rho(X)=7, and that the second family exists if and only if rho(X)=7. This provides the first examples of Fano 4-folds with rho(X)&gt;6 different from products of del Pezzo surfaces and from the Fano models of the blow-up of P^4 in points. We also construct three new families with rho(X)=6. Finally we show that if a Fano 4-fold X has Lefschetz defect delta(X)=2, then rho(X) is at most 6; this bound is again sharp.</description>

Abstract: We study the supersingular locus of a reduction at an inert prime of the Shimura variety attached to $\mathrm{GU}(2,n-2)$. More concretely, we decompose the supersingular locus into a disjoint union of iterated fibrations over (classical) Deligne-Lusztig varieties after taking perfection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.08088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for any prime $p$, there exist absolutely simple abelian varieties over $\mathbb{Q}$ with arbitrarily large $p$-torsion in their Tate-Shafarevich group. To prove this, we construct explicit $\mu_p$-covers of Jacobians of the form $y^p = x(x-1)(x-a)$ which violate the Hasse principle. In the appendix, Tom Fisher explains how to interpret our proof in terms of a Cassels-Tate pairing.</description>

      <title>B-brane Transport and Grade Restriction Rule for Determinantal Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study autoequivalences of $D^{b}Coh(X)$ associated to B-brane transport around loops in the stringy K\"ahler moduli of $X$. We consider the case of $X$ being certain resolutions of determinantal varieties embedded in $\mathbb{P}^{d}\times G(k,n)$. Such resolutions have been modeled, in general, by nonabelian gauged linear sigma models (GLSM). We use the GLSM construction to determine the window categories associated with B-brane transport between different geometric phases using the machinery of grade restriction rule and the hemisphere partition function. In the family of examples analyzed the monodromies around phase boundaries enjoy the interpretation as loop inside link complements. We exploit this interpretation to find a decomposition of autoequivalences into simpler spherical functors and we illustrate this in two examples of Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$, modeled by an abelian and nonabelian GLSM respectively. In additon we also determine explicitly the action of the autoequivalences on the Grothendieck group $K(X)$ (or equivalently, B-brane charges).</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometric Rook Codes for Coded Distributed Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend coded distributed computing over finite fields to allow the number of workers to be larger than the field size. We give codes that work for fully general matrix multiplication and show that in this case we serendipitously have that all functions can be computed in a distributed fault-tolerant fashion over finite fields. This generalizes previous results on the topic. We prove that the associated codes achieve a recovery threshold similar to the ones for characteristic zero fields but now with a factor that is proportional to the genus of the underlying function field. In particular, we have that the recovery threshold of these codes is proportional to the classical complexity of matrix multiplication by a factor of at most the genus.</description>

      <title>On two notions of total positivity for generalized partial flag varieties of classical Lie types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Grassmannians, Lusztig's notion of total positivity coincides with positivity of the Plucker coordinates. This coincidence underpins the rich interaction between matroid theory, tropical geometry, and the theory of total positivity. Bloch and Karp furthermore characterized the (type A) partial flag varieties for which the two notions of positivity similarly coincide. We characterize the symplectic (type C) and odd-orthogonal (type B) partial flag varieties for which Lusztig's total positivity coincides with Plucker positivity.</description>
