      <title>Fixed point counts and motivic invariants of bow varieties of affine type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the equivariant K-theory of torus fixed points of Cherkis bow varieties of affine type A. We deduce formulas for the generating series of the Euler numbers of these varieties and observe their modularity in certain cases. We also obtain refined formulas on the motivic level for a class of bow varieties strictly containing Nakajima quiver varieties. These series hence generalise results of Nakajima-Yoshioka. As a special case, we obtain formulas for certain Zastava spaces. We define a parabolic analogue of Nekrasov's partition function and find an equation relating it to the classical partition function.</description>

      <title>Extendability of projective varieties via degeneration to ribbons with applications to Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the extendability of a smooth projective variety by degenerating it to a ribbon. We apply the techniques to study extendability of Calabi-Yau threefolds $X_t$ that are general deformations of Calabi-Yau double covers of Fano threefolds of Picard rank $1$. The Calabi-Yau threefolds $X_t \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^{N_l}$, embedded by the complete linear series $|lA_t|$, where $A_t$ is the generator of Pic$(X_t)$, $l \geq j$ and $j$ is the index of $Y$, are general elements of a unique irreducible component $\mathscr{H}_l^Y$ of the Hilbert scheme which contains embedded Calabi-Yau ribbons on $Y$ as a special locus. For $l = j$, using the classification of Mukai varieties, we show that the general Calabi-Yau threefold parameterized by $\mathscr{H}_j^Y$ is as many times smoothly extendable as $Y$ itself. On the other hand, we find for each deformation type $Y$, an effective integer $l_Y$ such that for $l \geq l_Y$, the general Calabi-Yau threefold parameterized by $\mathscr{H}_l^Y$ is not extendable. These results provide a contrast and a parallel with the lower dimensional analogues; namely, $K3$ surfaces and canonical curves, which stems from the following result we prove: for $l \geq l_Y$, the general hyperplane sections of elements of $\mathscr{H}_l^Y$ fill out an entire irreducible component $\mathscr{S}_l^Y$ of the Hilbert scheme of canonical surfaces which are precisely $1-$ extendable with $\mathscr{H}^Y_l$ being the unique component dominating $\mathscr{S}_l^Y$. The contrast lies in the fact that for polarized $K3$ surfaces of large degree, the canonical curve sections do not fill out an entire component while the parallel is in the fact that the canonical curve sections are exactly one-extendable.</description>

      <title>The Syzygy Matrix and the Differential for Rational Curves in Projective Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study whether a given morphism $f$ from the tangent bundle of $\mathbb{P}^1$ to a balanced vector bundle of degree $(n+1)d$ is induced by the restriction of the tangent bundle $T_{\mathbb{P}^n}$ to a rational curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$. We propose a conjecture on this problem based on Mathematica computations of some examples and provide computer-assisted proof of the conjecture for certain values of $n$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>Double star arrangement and the pointed multinet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a hyperplane arrangement in a complex projective space. It is an open question if the degree one cohomology jump loci (with complex coefficients) are determined by the combinatorics of $\mathcal{A}$. By the work of Falk and Yuzvinsky \cite{FY}, all the irreducible components passing through the origin are determined by the multinet structure, which are combinatorially determined. Denham and Suciu introduced the pointed multinet structure to obtain examples of arrangements with translated positive-dimensional components in the degree one cohomology jump loci \cite{DS}. Suciu asked the question if all translated positive-dimensional components appear in this manner \cite{Suc14}. In this paper, we show that the double star arrangement introduced by Ishibashi, Sugawara and Yoshinaga \cite[Example 3.2]{ISY22} gives a negative answer to this question.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Locally Bounded Rational Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the geometry of rational functions on non-singular real algebraic varieties that are locally bounded. First various basic geometric and algebraic results regarding these functions are established in any dimension, culminating with a version of {\L}ojasiewicz's inequality. The geometry is further developed for the case of dimension 2, where it can be shown that there exist many of the usual correspondences between the algebra and geometry of these functions that one expects from complex algebraic geometry and from other classes of functions in real algebraic geometry such as regulous functions.</description>

      <title>Hyperplane Arrangements in the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the algebraic complexity of solving likelihood (or scattering) equations on this variety. We study this quantity for the Grassmannian with $d$ hyperplane sections removed. We provide a combinatorial formula, and explain how to compute this Euler characteristic in practice, both symbolically and numerically. Our particular focus is on generic hyperplane sections and on Schubert divisors. We also consider special Schubert arrangements relevant for physics. We study both the complex and the real case.</description>

      <title>Siegel operators for holomorphic differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a geometric interpretation of the Siegel operators for holomorphic differential forms on Siegel modular varieties. This involves extension of the differential forms over a toroidal compactification, and we show that the Siegel operator essentially describes the restriction and descent to the boundary Kuga variety via holomorphic Leray filtration. As a consequence, we obtain equivalence of various notions of "vanishing at boundary'' for holomorphic forms. We also study the case of orthogonal modular varieties.</description>

      <title>Prismatic logarithm and prismatic Hochschild homology via norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we present an elementary construction of the first Chern class of Hodge--Tate crystals in line bundles using a refinement of the prismatic logarithm, which should be comparable to the one considered by Bhargav Bhatt. The key to constructing this refinement is Yuri Sulyma's norm on (animated) prisms. We explain the relation of this construction to prismatic Witt vectors, as a generalization of Kaledin's polynomial Witt vectors. We also propose the prismatic Hochschild homology as a noncommutative analogue of prismatic de Rham complex.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian and Octonionic Satake equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a derived geometric Satake equivalence for the real group $G_{\mathbb R}=PSO(2n-1,1)$ (resp. $PE_6(F_4)$), to be called the Lorentzian Satake equivalence (resp. Octonionic Satake equivalence). By applying the real-symmetric correspondence for affine Grassmannians, we obtain a derived geometric Satake equivalence for the splitting rank symmetric variety $X=PSO_{2n}/SO_{2n-1}$ (resp. $PE_6/F_4$). As an application, we compute the stalks of the $\text{IC}$-complexes for spherical orbit closures in the real affine Grassmannian for $G_{\mathbb R}$ and the loop space of $X$. We show the stalks are given by the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials for $GL_2$ (resp. $GL_3$) but with $q$ replaced by $q^{n-1}$ (resp. $q^4$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show in this paper that in the context of graded Lie algebras, all cuspidal character sheaves arise from a nearby-cycle construction followed by a Fourier--Sato transform in a very specific manner. Combined with results of the last two named authors, this completes the explicit description of cuspidal character sheaves for Vinberg's type I graded classical Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the stability of tensor ranks under field extensions. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We prove that the analytic rank is stable under field extensions. (2) We establish the equivalence between the partition rank vs. analytic rank conjecture and the stability conjecture for partition rank. We also prove that they are equivalent to other two important conjectures. (3) We resolve the Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler conjecture on the stability of the slice rank of linear subspaces under field extensions. (4) As an application of (1), we show that the geometric rank is equal to the analytic rank up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers.</description>

      <title>Locally recoverable algebro-geometric codes with multiple recovery sets from projective bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A code is locally recoverable when each symbol in one of its code words can be reconstructed as a function of $r$ other symbols. We use bundles of projective spaces over a line to construct locally recoverable codes with availability; that is, evaluation codes where each code word symbol can be reconstructed from several disjoint sets of other symbols. The simplest case, where the code's underlying variety is a plane, exhibits noteworthy properties: When $r = 1$, $2$, $3$, they are optimal; when $r \geq 4$, they are optimal with probability approaching $1$ as the alphabet size grows. Additionally, their information rate is close to the theoretical limit. In higher dimensions, our codes form a family of asymptotically good codes.</description>

      <title>Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the finite orbits of the mapping class group action on the character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations of punctured spheres. In particular, we prove that the action has no finite orbits if the underlying sphere has 7 punctures or more. When the sphere has six punctures, we show that there is a unique 1-parameter family of finite orbits. Our methods also recover Tykhyy's classification of finite orbits for 5-punctured spheres. The proof is inductive and uses Lisovyy--Tykhyy's classification of finite mapping class group orbits for 4-punctured spheres as the base case for the induction.
  Our results on Deroin--Tholozan representations cover the last missing cases to complete the proof of Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits for $\mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of punctured spheres, after the recent work by Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the $\infty$-category of surjections of animated rings is projectively generated, introduce and study the notion of animated PD-pairs - surjections of animated rings with a "derived" PD-structure. This allows us to generalize classical results to non-flat and non-finitely-generated situations.
  Using animated PD-pairs, we develop several approaches to derived crystalline cohomology and establish comparison theorems. As an application, we generalize the comparison between derived and classical crystalline cohomology from syntomic (affine) schemes (due to Bhatt) to quasisyntomic schemes.
  We also develop a non-completed animated analogue of prisms and prismatic envelopes. We prove a variant of the Hodge-Tate comparison for animated prismatic envelopes from which we deduce a result about flat cover of the final object for quasisyntomic schemes, which generalizes several known results under smoothness and finiteness conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization and Hodge structures of some rationally elliptic projective fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the rationally elliptic projective fourfolds that are holomorphically embedded into the complex projective eight-space $\mathbb{P}^8$. It is proved that a simply-connected $\mathbb Q$-homological projective four-space $X\subset\mathbb{P}^8$ is biholomorphic to $\mathbb P^4$ by using Euler characteristic and Chern numbers formulae of the normal bundle for a holomorphic embedding $i:X \to\mathbb{P}^8$. During the process of proving the result, we incidentally discovered that a $\mathbb{Q}$-homological projective 4-space $X$ with Kodaira dimension $k(X) \neq 4$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^4$. This finding provides a positive answer to a question posed by Wilson in the case where the dimension $n=4$. Using a similar approach, we show that the Hodge conjecture holds for the rationally elliptic fourfold $X \subset\mathbb{P}^8$, and the rationally elliptic fourfold $X \subset\mathbb{P}^8$ has non-positive Hodge level.</description>

      <title>Stability of Kernel Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of general kernel bundles on $\mathbb{P}^n$. Let $a,b,d&gt;0$ be integers. A kernel bundle $E_{a,b}$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ is defined as the kernel of a surjective map $\phi:\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}(-d)^a\rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^n}^b$. Here $\phi$ is represented by a $b\times a$ matrix $(f_{ij})$ where the entries $f_{ij}$ are polynomials of degree $d$. We give sufficient conditions for semistability of a general kernel bundle on $\mathbb{P}^n$, in terms of its Chern class.</description>

      <title>A global approach for the redefinition of higher-order flexibility and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous example of the double-Watt mechanism given by Connelly and Servatius raises some problems concerning the classical definitions of higher-order flexibility and rigidity, respectively, as they attest the cusp configuration of the mechanism a third-order rigidity, which conflicts with its continuous flexion. Some attempts were done to resolve the dilemma but they could not settle the problem. As cusp mechanisms demonstrate the basic shortcoming of any local mobility analysis using higher-order constraints, we present a global approach inspired by Sabitov's finite algorithm for testing the bendability of a polyhedron, which allows us (a) to compute iteratively configurations with a higher-order flexion and (b) to come up with a proper redefinition of higher-order flexibility and rigidity. We also give algorithms for computing the flexion orders as well as the associated flexes. The presented approach is demonstrated on several examples (double-Watt mechanisms and Tarnai's Leonardo structure). Moreover, we determine all configurations of a given 3-RPR manipulator with a third-order flexion and present a corresponding joint-bar framework of flexion order 23.</description>

      <title>Minimal compactifications of the affine plane with only star-shaped singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider minimal compactifications of the complex affine plane. Minimal compactifications of the affine plane with at most log canonical singularities are classified. Moreover, every minimal compactification of the affine plane with at most log canonical singularities has only star-shaped singular points. In this article, we classify minimal compactifications of the affine plane with only star-shaped singular points.</description>

      <title>Relative-Hyper GAGA Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a relative hypercohomology version of Serre's GAGA theorem. We prove that the relative hypercohomology of a complex of sheaves on a complex projective variety is isomorphic to the relative hypercohomology of its analytification, with respect to an open or closed subvariety. This result implies Serre's original GAGA theorem.</description>

      <title>Homology of loops on a splitting-rank symmetric space via the Geometric Satake for real groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Nadler's Geometric Satake Equivalence for real reductive groups, we obtain a description of the equivariant homology of the loop space of splitting-rank symmetric spaces in terms of the relative dual group of the space. The description is in line with Yun and Zhu's calculation for the loop space of a compact Lie group. The formula hints at a relative duality for these spaces.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e-Lelong type formulas and Segre numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $E$and $F$ be Hermitian vector bundles over a complex manifold $X$ and let $g\colon E\to F$ be a holomorphic morphism. We prove a Poincar\'e-Lelong type formula with a residue term $M^g$. The currents $M^g$ so obtained have an expected functorial property. We discuss various applications: If $F$ has a trivial holomorphic subbundle of rank $r$ outside the analytic set $Z$, then we get currents with support on $Z$ that represent the Bott-Chern classes $\hat c_k(E)$ for $k &gt;\rank E-r$. We also consider Segre and Chern forms associated with certain singular metrics on $F$. The multiplicities (Lelong numbers) of the various components of $M^g$ only depend on the cokernel of the adjoint sheaf morphism $g^*$. This leads to a notion of distinguished varieties and Segre numbers of an arbitrary coherent sheaf, generalizing these notions, in particular the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity, in case of an ideal sheaf.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to functional equations for general multiple Dirichlet series over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sawin recently gave an axiomatic characterization of multiple Dirichlet series over the function field $\mathbb{F}_{q}(T)$ and proved their existence by exhibiting the coefficients as trace functions of specific perverse sheaves. However, he did not prove that these series actually converge anywhere, instead treating them as formal power series.
  In this paper, we prove that these series do converge in a certain region, and moreover that the functions obtained by analytically continuing them satisfy functional equations.
  For convergence, it suffices to obtain bounds on the coefficients, for which we use the decomposition theorem for perverse sheaves, in combination with the Kontsevich moduli space of stable maps to construct a suitable compactification.
  For the functional equations, the key identity is a multi-variable generalization of the relationship between a Dirichlet character and its Fourier transform; in the multiple Dirichlet series setting, this uses a density trick for simple perverse sheaves and an explicit formula for intermediate extensions from the complement of a normal crossings divisor.</description>

      <title>Degenerate and irregular topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>
