      <title>Energetic-particle orbits near rational flux surfaces in stellarators: I. Passing particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent simulations have shown that, even when the magnetic field of a stellarator possesses nested toroidal flux surfaces, the orbits of passing energetic particles can exhibit islands. These 'drift islands' arise near rational flux surfaces, where they are likely to enhance alpha-particle transport -- flattening the alpha density profile locally -- unless they can be avoided by suitable design of the stellarator magnetic field. To investigate how this might be achieved, we derive an equation for the drift-island shape in a general stellarator. This result follows from the solution to a more fundamental problem: that of calculating the orbits of passing particles near a rational flux surface. We show that these orbits are determined by conservation of an adiabatic invariant associated with the closed rational-surface field lines. We use this 'transit adiabatic invariant' to prove that there are no drift islands, for all passing particles, if and only if the magnetic field satisfies a weaker version of the Cary-Shasharina condition for omnigeneity; we call such magnetic fields 'cyclometric'. The drift-island width scales as $\sim (\rho_\star\delta/s)^{1/2} a$ ($\rho_\star$ is the normalized gyroradius, $\delta$ is the deviation from cyclometry, $s$ is the magnetic shear, and $a$ is the minor radius), so large drift islands could arise in low-shear stellarators that are insufficiently cyclometric. To ensure accurate results for very energetic particles, we compute higher-order corrections to the transit invariant. Our calculations agree extremely well with ASCOT5 guiding-centre and full-orbit simulations of alpha particles in reactor-scale equilibria, even at $3.5\text{MeV}$. Finally, we show how our results can also be derived using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, which provides a systematic framework for calculating passing-particle orbits on both rational and irrational surfaces.</description>

      <title>Understanding cold electron impact on parallel-propagating whistler chorus waves via moment-based quasilinear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's magnetosphere hosts a wide range of collisionless particle populations that interact through various wave-particle processes. Among these, cold electrons, with energies below 100eV, often dominate the plasma density but remain poorly characterized due to measurement challenges such as spacecraft charging and photoelectron contamination. Understanding the contribution of these cold populations to wave-particle interaction is of significant interest. Recent kinetic simulations identified a secondary drift-driven instability in which parallel-propagating whistler-mode chorus waves excite oblique electrostatic whistler waves near the resonance cone and Bernstein-mode turbulence. These secondary modes enable a new channel of energy transfer from the parallel-propagating whistler wave to the cold electrons. In this work, we develop a moment-based quasilinear theory of the secondary instabilities to quantify such energy exchange. Our results show that these secondary instabilities persist for a wide range of parameters and, in many cases, lead to nearly complete damping of the primary wave. Such secondary instability might limit the amplitude of parallel-propagating whistler waves in Earth's magnetosphere and might explain why high-amplitude oblique whistler or electron Bernstein waves are rarely observed simultaneously with high-amplitude field-aligned whistler waves in the inner magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Microbubble implosions in finite hollow spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbubble implosion (MBI) is a recently proposed novel mechanism with many interesting and exciting potential applications. MBI predicts that the inner layers of a spherical target with a hollow cavity can be compressed into a core with a density 105 times that of the solid density. Furthermore, this ultra-compressed core mostly consists of ions. This leads to the generation of ultra-high electric fields, which may be applicable to gamma-ray lensing or pair creation. However, MBI has yet to be studied for finite hollow spheres whose electrons are free to redistribute themselves after being given an initial temperature. This paper studies MBI under finite sphere conditions. Using an elec- tron distribution model, the electron distribution after receiving an initial temperature is studied. Then, the optimal parameters required to fill a hollow cavity with electrons are calculated. The dynamics of MBI is simulated using a hybrid one-dimensional code. The simulation demonstrates that MBI occurs even for finite spheres, and high-density compression is still achievable with this setup. It also shows the opti- mal target structure, which maximizes ion flashing.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field amplification driven by the gyro motion of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous magnetic field generation plays important role in laser-plasma interactions. Strong quasi-static magnetic fields affect the thermal conductivity and the plasma dynamics, particularly in the case of ultra intense laser where the magnetic part of Lorentz force becomes as significant as the electric part. Kinetic simulations of giga-gauss magnetic field amplification via a laser irradiated microtube structure reveal the dynamics of charged particle implosions and the mechanism of magnetic field growth. A giga-gauss magnetic field is generated and amplified with the opposite polarity to the seed magnetic field. The spot size of the field is comparable to the laser wavelength, and the lifetime is hundreds of femtoseconds. An analytical model is presented to explain the underlying physics. This study should aid in designing future experiments.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Penetration into Dusty Magnetospheres creates Electrostatic Waves and Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low frequency electrostatic perturbations have been investigated in a bi ion plasma in the background of static dust. It is shown that the field aligned shear flow of both the ions produce low frequency electrostatic instabilities and create nonlinear structures, the double layers and the solitons. The general theoretical model is applied to the magnetospheres of Jupiter (with positively charged dust) and Saturn (with negatively charged dust) which have oxygen ions in addition to protons. This model predicts the existence of extremely low frequency electrostatic waves with real frequencies of the order of a milli Hertz (mHz) to several mHz and this range of frequencies have been reported in literature for these plasma environments. The estimated width of the nonlinear structures vary from a few hundred meters to a few kilometers. These structures are similar to that observed in the oxygen and oxygen hydrogen plasmas in Earth's upper ionosphere which is free from dust.</description>

      <title>Integrating High Performance In-Memory Data Streaming and In-Situ Visualization in Hybrid MPI+OpenMP PIC MC Simulations Towards Exascale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03914v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of complex plasma dynamics is crucial for advancing fusion energy research. Particle-in-Cell (PIC) Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide insights into plasma behavior, including turbulence and confinement, which are essential for optimizing fusion reactor performance. Transitioning to exascale simulations introduces significant challenges, with traditional file input/output (I/O) inefficiencies remaining a key bottleneck. This work advances BIT1, an electrostatic PIC MC code, by improving the particle mover with OpenMP task-based parallelism, integrating the openPMD streaming API, and enabling in-memory data streaming with ADIOS2's Sustainable Staging Transport (SST) engine to enhance I/O performance, computational efficiency, and system storage utilization. We employ profiling tools such as gprof, perf, IPM and Darshan, which provide insights into computation, communication, and I/O operations. We implement time-dependent data checkpointing with the openPMD API enabling seamless data movement and in-situ visualization for real-time analysis without interrupting the simulation. We demonstrate improvements in simulation runtime, data accessibility and real-time insights by comparing traditional file I/O with the ADIOS2 BP4 and SST backends. The proposed hybrid BIT1 openPMD SST enhancement introduces a new paradigm for real-time scientific discovery in plasma simulations, enabling faster insights and more efficient use of exascale computing resources.</description>

      <title>Subgrid Mean-field Dynamo Model with Dynamical Quenching in General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</title>

Abstract: Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $\alpha_\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $\alpha_\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $\alpha_\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear theory of perpendicular ion heating by critically balanced turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfv\'enic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfv\'enic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beth--Uhlenbeck entropy formula from the $\Phi-$derivable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the entropy of a dense fermion system with strong two-particle correlations, including scattering states and bound states. We work within the $\Phi-$derivable approach to the thermodynamic potential. The formula takes the form of an energy-momentum integral over a statistical distribution function times a unique spectral density. In the near mass-shell limit, the spectral density reduces, contrary to na\"{i}ve expectations, not to a Lorentzian but rather to a "squared Lorentzian" shape. The relation of the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula to the $\Phi$-derivable approach is exact at the two-loop level for $\Phi$. The formalism we develop, which extends the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach beyond the low-density limit, includes Mott dissociation of bound states, in accordance with Levinson's theorem, and the self-consistent back reaction of correlations in the fermion propagation. We discuss applications to further systems, such as quark matter and nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Centrifuge Effects in Ultrafast Laser Ablation Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with effective rotation rates on the order of $10^9$ radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field $B_{eff}$ is extracted for Ni isotopes which is shown to be a combination of an axial $B_z$ component and a second contribution $B_{ibw}$ that represents the equivalent of an effective magnetic field contributing to the isotopic separation due to broad spectrum Ion Bernstein Waves providing electrostatic acceleration to the cyclotron orbits. These IBWs are also responsible for a profound resonance of enrichment observed for certain specific charge states. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotation and IBWs dominate the process.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>
