      <title>Polarization-dependent chiral transport and chiral solitons in spin Kitaev models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in synthetic quantum matter allow researchers to design quantum models inaccessible in traditional materials. Here, we propose protocols to engineer a new class of quantum spin models, which we call spin Kitaev models. The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions combined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently demonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and flop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond conventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field, spin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in opposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the large-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson model, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields polarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely polarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel direction depends on its orientation. Our results, directly accessible in current experiments, open new opportunities for simulating transport in curved spaces and for applications in spintronics, information processing, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and transport of Bose-Einstein condensates in bent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of bosons in curved geometries have recently attracted significant interest in quantum many-body physics. Leveraging recent experimental advances in tailored trapping landscapes, we investigate the quantum transport of weakly interacting bosons in two-dimensional bent trapping potentials, showing that geometry alone can serve as a precise control knob for tunneling dynamics. Using time-adaptive many-body simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis and exact diagonalization, we analyze both static and dynamical properties of bosons confined in the bent potential. We reveal how bending an initially straight channel induces a transition from density localization to delocalization and drives the buildup of correlations in the ground state. In the dynamics, the bent acts as a tunable barrier that enables controllable tunneling: weak curvature allows coherent tunnelling across the bend, while stronger bent suppresses transport and enhances self-trapping. The tunneling rate can be precisely tuned by geometric parameters, establishing bent traps as versatile platforms for geometry-controlled quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of higher-order cumulants in quantum isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding universal behavior of far-from-equilibrium transport dynamics at a quantum many body level is a longstanding challenge. In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Kinetic contribution to the arbitrary order odd frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact expression is derived for the kinetic contribution to the odd (arbitrary order) frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor via a finite summation that features averages of even (all lower orders) powers of the momentum over the exact momentum distribution. The derivation is carried out for the non-interacting Fermi gas and generalized to the interacting case based on the conjecture that averages over the Fermi distribution can be substituted with averages over the exact distribution. The expression is validated against known results (first, third frequency moments) and new explicit calculations (fifth, seventh frequency moments).</description>

      <title>Realizing an Atomtronic AQUID in a Rotating-Box Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomtronic devices are matter-wave circuits designed to emulate the functional behavior of their electronic counterparts. Motivated by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), atomic quantum interference devices (AQUIDs) have been developed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) confined in toroidal geometries. Here, we propose and numerically investigate an alternative implementation of an AQUID based on a BEC confined in a rotating box potential. A ring-like topology is established by introducing a central depletion region via a repulsive potential barrier. We observe the hallmark AQUID feature -- quantized phase winding that increases in discrete steps with angular velocity. Centrifugal effects induced by rotation degrade phase coherence and impair AQUID performance, which we mitigate by applying a counteracting harmonic confinement. Phase slips are found to be mediated by a vortex propagating from the central depletion zone to the edge of the condensate. To characterize the voltage response, we induce a bias current by translating the box along its long axis while keeping the central barrier fixed. This generates a density imbalance between the two reservoirs, exhibiting a periodic dependence on angular velocity -- analogous to the voltage-flux relation in electronic SQUIDs. Our results demonstrate that rotating box geometries provide a viable and flexible platform for realizing atomtronic AQUIDs with controllable dynamics and well-defined response characteristics.</description>

      <title>Optical formation of ultracold NaK$_2$ ground state molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rovibronic transitions in NaK$_2$ between its electronic ground state $1^2A'$ and its second excited state $3^2A'$, to identify possible pathways for the creation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules. Our methodology relies on the computation of potential energy surfaces and transition dipole moment surfaces for the relevant electronic states using ab initio methods. Rovibrational energy levels and wave functions are determined using the discrete variable representation approach. A double-well structure of the potential energy surface is identified for both states, and the related transition strengths between the rovibrational levels are derived. Our calculations show that the formation of ultracold ground-state NaK$_2$ molecules is expected when starting from an excited electronic state of NaK$_2$, which can be created by photoassociation of NaK and K observed by optical means by Cao et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2024, 132, 093403).</description>

      <title>Numerical validation of an ultracold Hubbard quantum simluator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the formally exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) method to probe the unprecedentedly low-temperature regime recently achieved in an ultracold-atom quantum simulation of the 2D Hubbard model [Xu et al., Nature 642, 909 (2025)]. Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Bose-Einstein Condensation of an ideal Magnetized Charged Bosonic gas under neutron star-like conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting, relativistic gas of charged scalar bosons in a uniform magnetic field, including both statistical and vacuum contributions at arbitrary field strengths. Focusing on the low-temperature regime and separating the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) from excited states provides a clearer view of the magnetic field's impact on thermodynamic quantities. We revisit Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), specific heat, magnetization, and the equation of state (EoS). A central result is the diffuse character of BEC induced by the magnetic field, reflected in the specific heat, which exhibits two plateaus: the first appears when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional through magnetic confinement, while the second-associated with the true one-particle ground state-is suppressed by the field. Consequently, no critical condensation temperature arises. For magnetization, the LLL contribution shifts from diamagnetic to paramagnetic As the field strengthen with the inclusion of the excited states, the statistical magnetization remains negative. In contrast, the vacuum contribution dominates at strong fields, driving paramagnetic. We also show that antiparticles enhance specific heat, magnetization, and total pressure. These effects are illustrated for a pion gas under neutron star conditions and compared with previous results for a neutral vector boson system.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of global U(1) symmetry in an interacting Bose gas under rigid rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of rigid rotation on the spontaneous breaking of U(1) symmetry in a Bose gas, which is described by a self-interacting complex scalar field Lagrangian. Rigid rotation is introduced through a specific metric that explicitly depends on the angular velocity $\Omega$. We begin by determining the free propagator for this model at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. Using this propagator, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in terms of an energy dispersion relation $\epsilon_{k}$. It is found that in both the U(1) symmetric phase and the symmetry-broken phase, two energy branches emerge. In the symmetry-broken phase, they are identified with a massive phonon and a massless roton mode. Notably, rotation does not alter $\epsilon_{k}$ at low momentum. Setting $\mu=0$, we use the total thermodynamic potential, which includes classical, thermal, vacuum, and nonperturbative ring contributions, to explore how the condensate depends on $T$ and $\Omega$. We first focus on the classical and thermal parts of the thermodynamic potential and find that the critical temperature of the U(1) phase transition scales as $\Omega^{1/3}$. By identifying the (pseudo-)Goldstone and non-Goldstone modes of this model with $\pi$ and $\sigma$ mesons, we calculate the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of masses $m_{\pi}$ and $m_{\sigma}$. We demonstrate that the Goldstone theorem holds only when the one-loop (thermal) corrections to $m_{\sigma}$ and $m_{\pi}$ are taken into account. We further explore the $T$ and $\Omega$ dependence of the condensate, determine the $\sigma$ dissociation temperatures for fixed $\Omega$, and compare them with the critical temperature of the phase transition. Additionally, we emphasize the role played by the nonperturbative ring potential, especially in altering the order of the phase transition with and without rotation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Photon Bose-Einstein Condensation from Down-Scattering in Cold Electron Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the emergence of photon Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) resulting from the interaction of high-energy photons with a cold electron gas, modeled via a modified Kompaneets equation. Beginning with an initial black-body photon spectrum, we perform numerical simulations to track the evolution of the photon distribution under the influence of inverse Compton scattering, wherein photons dissipate energy through collisions with cold electrons. Our results demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of photon number density at the low-energy tail, indicative of a BEC-like phase transition. This phenomenon is further corroborated by an analysis of the entropy evolution during the cooling process, revealing that the condensate configuration corresponds to the entropy maximum, in accordance with thermodynamic principles. These findings establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for photon BEC formation in cold electron environments and underscore the significance of entropy maximization as a driving mechanism for condensation.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution for Two $\delta$-Interacting Bosons on a Ring in the Presence of a $\delta$-Barrier: Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz for Spatially Odd States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the recently proposed Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz method to the problem of two one-dimensional, short-range-interacting bosons on a ring in the presence of a $\delta$-function barrier. Only half of the Hilbert space--namely, the two-body states that are odd under point inversion about the position of the barrier--is accessible to this method. The other half is presumably non-integrable. We consider benchmarking the recently proposed $1/g$ expansion about the hard-core boson point [A. G. Volosniev, D. V. Fedorov, A. S. Jensen, M. Valiente, N. T. Zinner, Nature Communications 5, 5300 (2014)] as one application of our results. Additionally, we find that when the $\delta$-barrier is converted to a $\delta$-well with strength equal to that of the particle-particle interaction, the system exhibits the spectrum of its non-interacting counterpart while its eigenstates display features of a strongly interacting system. We discuss this phenomenon in the "Summary and Future Research" section of our paper.</description>

Abstract: We develop a Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to numerically evaluate the Lehmann representation for the finite temperature single-particle Green's function in the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This allows us to determine the spectral function in the full range of temperatures and interactions, as well as in generalized Gibbs ensembles. We test our results against the known limit of infinite interaction strength and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological physics, inspiring extensive explo- rations of its high-dimensional generalizations. Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi- mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work. Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore, the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the fractional topological states in high dimension.</description>

      <title>Observation of hysteresis in an isolated quantum system of disordered Heisenberg spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find energy-dependent hysteresis in an isolated Heisenberg quantum spin system, similar to thermomagnetic hysteresis in canonical spin glasses in contact with a thermal reservoir. Analogous to zero-field cooling and field cooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to control the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of disorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy, which signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is apparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with thousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The annealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase structure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal metastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel state of isolated quantum spin systems.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a method for implementing the Hamiltonian incorporating Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions within Rydberg atoms arranged in a two-dimensional square lattice, utilizing Floquet engineering. In our scheme, we use both global and local operations of the spins. The global operations can be realized by applying the microwave and the local operations can be realized by the locally addressing lasers, which yields the ac-Stark shift. Since our engineered Hamiltonian contains bond-dependent DM interactions, we expect the emergence of quantum skyrmions in the ground state.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>

Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass, or equivalently by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.</description>

      <title>Ideal Fermi gas in the Dunkl formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas within the framework of the Dunkl formalism, which incorporates deformation effects through reflection symmetric differential operators. The formalism is applied to reformulate the creation and annihilation operators, leading to modified expressions for the fundamental thermodynamic quantities while preserving the underlying Fermi Dirac statistics. We derived modified expressions for the main thermodynamic quantities. In both the non degenerate and degenerate limits, we examined the effects of the Dunkl parameter on the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity. Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli paramagnetism.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem: generic quadratic open fermionic systems governed by Lindblad master equations do not host dissipation-free topological edge states protected by the dissipation gap. By analogy with topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindblad generator to a first-quantized non-Hermitian matrix representation that plays the role of a band Hamiltonian. Edge modes of this matrix with vanishing real part are exactly dissipation-free. We show that this matrix is always adiabatically deformable, through a symmetry-preserving path, to a topologically trivial Hermitian matrix. Hence no symmetry-protected, dissipation-free edge modes exist in quadratic open fermions. Our results apply to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians and require only a gapped bulk and a bounded spectrum. They establish a clear boundary for robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>
