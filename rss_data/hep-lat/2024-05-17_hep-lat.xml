      <title>Searching for the QCD critical endpoint using multi-point Pad\'e approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the multi-point Pad\'e approach, we locate Lee-Yang edge singularities of the QCD pressure in the complex baryon chemical potential plane. These singularities are extracted from singularities in the net baryon-number density calculated in $N_f=2+1$ lattice QCD at physical quark mass and purely imaginary chemical potential. Taking an appropriate scaling ansatz in the vicinity of the conjectured QCD critical endpoint, we extrapolate the singularities on $N_\tau=6$ lattices to pure real baryon chemical potential to estimate the position of the critical endpoint (CEP). We find $T^{\rm CEP}=105^{+8}_{-18}$~ MeV and $\mu_B^{\rm CEP} = 422^{+80}_{-35}$~ MeV, which compares well with recent estimates in the literature. For the slope of the transition line at the critical point we find $-0.16(24)$.</description>

      <title>Interacting chiral fermions on the lattice with matrix product operator norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for simulating one-dimensional interacting chiral fermions on the lattice without breaking any local symmetries by defining a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm defined in terms of matrix product operators. This formalism can be understood as a second-quantized form of Stacey fermions, hence providing a possible solution for the fermion doubling problem and circumventing the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We prove that the emerging theory is hermitian by virtue of the fact that it gives rise to a hermitian generalized eigenvalue problem and that it has local features as it can be simulated using tensor network methods similar to the ones used for simulating local quantum Hamiltonians. We also show that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code demonstrating that the ground states of the system for large system sizes can be determined efficiently.</description>

      <title>Towards Unpolarized GPDs from Pseudo-Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the unpolarized isovector proton generalized parton distributions (GPDs) $H^{u-d}(x, \xi, t)$ and $E^{u-d}(x, \xi, t)$ in the pseudo-distribution formalism using distillation. Taking advantage of the large kinematic coverage made possible by this approach, we present results on the moments of GPDs up to the order $x^3$ -- including their skewness dependence -- at a pion mass $m_\pi = 358$ MeV and a lattice spacing $a = 0.094$ fm.</description>

      <title>Corrections to adiabatic behavior for long paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cost and the error of the adiabatic theorem for preparing the final eigenstate are discussed in terms of path length. Previous studies in terms of the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivatives with the spectral gap are limited to describe the cost of adiabatic state preparation for large systems. We argue that total time is not a good measure for determining the computational difficulty of adiabatic quantum computation by developing a no-go theorem. From the result of time-periodic Hamiltonian cases, we suggest that there are proxies for computational cost which typically grow as path length increases when the error is kept fixed and small and consider possible conjectures on how general the behavior is.</description>

      <title>The Dilaton Improves Goldstones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free scalar field is only conformally invariant when non-minimally coupled to gravity. In flat space this amounts to amending, or improving, the energy momentum tensor. A no-go theorem prohibits the improvement for Goldstone bosons, originating from global internal spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is shown that the no-go theorem can be circumvented in the presence of a dilaton. The latter is a (pseudo) Goldstone boson originating from spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking in a theory with an infrared fixed point. Specifically, the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor is demonstrated for a generic $d$-dimensional curved space. Additionally, the Goldstone gravitational form factors are shown to obey conformality constraints in the soft limit. The crucial point is that the remainder term of the soft theorem is non-zero due to the presence of the dilaton pole. For Goldstone systems with a trivial infrared fixed point the leading order analysis of this paper ought to be sufficient. Loop effects govern the improvement term outside the fixed point and are scheme-dependent as briefly discussed towards the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra of heavy hybrid quarkonia and $\overline{b}gc$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masses and current couplings of the charmonium and bottomonium hybrids $ \overline{c}gc$ and $\overline{b}gb$ with spin-parities $J^{\mathrm{PC} }=0^{++},\ 0^{+-},\ 0^{-+},\ 0^{--}$ and $1^{++},\ 1^{+-},\ 1^{-+},\ 1^{--}$ are calculated using QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are performed by taking into account gluon condensates up to dimension 12 including terms $\sim \langle g_{s}^{3}G^{3}\rangle ^{2}$. The parameters of the bottom-charm hybrids $\overline{b}gc$ with quantum numbers $J^{\mathrm{PC }}=0^{+},\ 0^{-},\ 1^{+}$, and $1^{-}$ are calculated as well. In computations the dominance of the pole contribution to sum rule results is ensured. It is demonstrated that all charmonia hybrids decay strongly to two-meson final states. The bottomonium hybrids $0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ as well as the bottom-charm hybrid mesons $0^{-(+)}$ and $1^{-(+)}$ may be stable against strong two-meson decay modes. Results of the present work are compared with ones obtained using the sum rule and alternative approaches. Our predictions for parameters of the heavy hybrid mesons may be useful to study their various decay channels which are important for interpretation of ongoing and future experiments.</description>
