      <title>Markowitz Variance May Vastly Undervalue or Overestimate Portfolio Variance and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of his portfolio. The investor only observes the current trades made in the market with his securities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged portfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market with the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model the trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the equal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the portfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance describes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the coefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize this dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we derive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the coefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We consider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio returns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that the impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can cause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the market-based variance of the portfolio. Incorrect assessments of the variances of securities and of the portfolio cause wrong risk estimates, disturb optimal portfolio selection, and result in unexpected losses. The major investors, portfolio managers, and developers of macroeconomic models like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed should use market-based variance to adjust their predictions to the randomness of market trades.</description>

      <title>Indifference pricing of pure endowments in a regime-switching market model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the exponential utility indifference pricing of pure endowment policies within a stochastic-factor model for an insurer who also invests in a financial market. Our framework incorporates a hazard rate modeled as an observable diffusion process, while the risky asset price follows a jump-diffusion process driven by a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain, effectively capturing different economic regimes. Using the classical stochastic control approach based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we derive optimal investment strategies with and without the insurance derivative and characterize the indifference price as a classical solution to a linear partial differential equation (PDE). Additionally, we provide a probabilistic representation of the indifference price via an extension of the Feynman-Kac formula and show that it satisfies a suitable backward PDE. Finally, some numerical experiments are conducted to perform sensitivity analyses, highlighting the impact of key model parameters.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</description>
