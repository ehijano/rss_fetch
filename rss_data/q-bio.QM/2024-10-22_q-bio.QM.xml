      <title>DNA Language Model and Interpretable Graph Neural Network Identify Genes and Pathways Involved in Rare Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of causal genes and pathways is a critical step for understanding the genetic underpinnings of rare diseases. We propose novel approaches to gene prioritization and pathway identification using DNA language model, graph neural networks, and genetic algorithm. Using HyenaDNA, a long-range genomic foundation model, we generated dynamic gene embeddings that reflect changes caused by deleterious variants. These gene embeddings were then utilized to identify candidate genes and pathways. We validated our method on a cohort of rare disease patients with partially known genetic diagnosis, demonstrating the re-identification of known causal genes and pathways and the detection of novel candidates. These findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of rare diseases by enabling targeted identification of new drug targets and therapeutic pathways.</description>

      <title>Precision Adaptive Hormone Control for Personalized Metastatic Prostate Cancer Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the oncologist acting as the ``game leader'', we employ a Stackelberg game-theoretic model involving multiple populations to study prostate cancer. We refine the drug dosing schedule using an empirical Bayes feed-forward analysis, based on clinical data that reflects each patient's prostate-specific drug response. Our methodology aims for a quantitative grasp of the parameter landscape of this adaptive multi-population model, focusing on arresting the growth of drug-resistant prostate cancer by promoting competition across drug-sensitive cancer cell populations. Our findings indicate that not only is it is feasible to considerably extend cancer suppression duration through careful optimization, but even transform metastatic prostate cancer into a chronic condition instead of an acute one for most patients, with supporting clinical and analytical evidence.</description>

      <title>Airborne Biomarker Localization Engine (ABLE) for Open Air Point-of-Care Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike biomarkers in biofluids, airborne biomarkers are dilute and difficult to trace. Detecting diverse airborne biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity typically relies on bulky and expensive equipment like mass spectrometers that remain inaccessible to the general population. Here, we introduce Airborne Biomarker Localization Engine (ABLE), a simple, affordable, and portable platform that can detect both volatile, non-volatile, molecular, and particulate biomarkers in about 15 minutes. ABLE significantly improves gas detection limits by converting dilute gases into droplets by water condensation, producing concentrated aqueous samples that are easy to be tested. Fundamental studies of multiphase condensation revealed unexpected stability in condensate-trapped biomarkers, making ABLE a reliable, accessible, and high-performance system for open-air-based biosensing applications such as non-contact infant healthcare, pathogen detection in public space, and food safety.</description>

      <title>Anonymising Elderly and Pathological Speech: Voice Conversion Using DDSP and Query-by-Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech anonymisation aims to protect speaker identity by changing personal identifiers in speech while retaining linguistic content. Current methods fail to retain prosody and unique speech patterns found in elderly and pathological speech domains, which is essential for remote health monitoring. To address this gap, we propose a voice conversion-based method (DDSP-QbE) using differentiable digital signal processing and query-by-example. The proposed method, trained with novel losses, aids in disentangling linguistic, prosodic, and domain representations, enabling the model to adapt to uncommon speech patterns. Objective and subjective evaluations show that DDSP-QbE significantly outperforms the voice conversion state-of-the-art concerning intelligibility, prosody, and domain preservation across diverse datasets, pathologies, and speakers while maintaining quality and speaker anonymity. Experts validate domain preservation by analysing twelve clinically pertinent domain attributes.</description>

      <title>CPE-Pro: A Structure-Sensitive Deep Learning Model for Protein Representation and Origin Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein structures are important for understanding their functions and interactions. Currently, many protein structure prediction methods are enriching the structure database. Discriminating the origin of structures is crucial for distinguishing between experimentally resolved and computationally predicted structures, evaluating the reliability of prediction methods, and guiding downstream biological studies. Building on works in structure prediction, We developed a structure-sensitive supervised deep learning model, Crystal vs Predicted Evaluator for Protein Structure (CPE-Pro), to represent and discriminate the origin of protein structures. CPE-Pro learns the structural information of proteins and captures inter-structural differences to achieve accurate traceability on four data classes, and is expected to be extended to more. Simultaneously, we utilized Foldseek to encode protein structures into "structure-sequence" and trained a protein Structural Sequence Language Model, SSLM. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that, compared to large-scale protein language models pre-trained on vast amounts of amino acid sequences, the "structure-sequences" enable the language model to learn more informative protein features, enhancing and optimizing structural representations. We have provided the code, model weights, and all related materials on https://github.com/GouWenrui/CPE-Pro-main.git.</description>

      <title>Harnessing single polarization doppler weather radars for tracking Desert Locust Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Desert locusts are notorious agriculture pests prompting billions in losses and global food scarcity concerns. With billions of these locusts invading agrarian lands, this is no longer a thing of the past. This study taps into the existing doppler weather radar (DWR) infrastructure which was originally deployed for meteorological applications. This study demonstrates a systematic approach to distinctly identify and track concentrations of desert locust swarms in near real time using single polarization radars. Findings reveal the potential to establish early warning systems with lead times of around 7 hours and spatial coverage of approximately 100 kilometers. Embracing these technological advancements are crucial to safeguard agricultural landscapes and upload global food security.</description>

      <title>Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Microbiome Relative Abundance Data Using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within the microbiome is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Traditional machine learning models often lack interpretability, which is essential for clinical and biological insights. This paper explores the application of symbolic regression (SR) to microbiome relative abundance data, with a focus on colorectal cancer (CRC). SR, known for its high interpretability, is compared against traditional machine learning models, e.g., random forest, gradient boosting decision trees. These models are evaluated based on performance metrics such as F1 score and accuracy. We utilize 71 studies encompassing, from various cohorts, over 10,000 samples across 749 species features. Our results indicate that SR not only competes reasonably well in terms of predictive performance, but also excels in model interpretability. SR provides explicit mathematical expressions that offer insights into the biological relationships within the microbiome, a crucial advantage for clinical and biological interpretation. Our experiments also show that SR can help understand complex models like XGBoost via knowledge distillation. To aid in reproducibility and further research, we have made the code openly available at https://github.com/swag2198/microbiome-symbolic-regression .</description>

      <title>Geometric Self-Supervised Pretraining on 3D Protein Structures using Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein representation learning aims to learn informative protein embeddings capable of addressing crucial biological questions, such as protein function prediction. Although sequence-based transformer models have shown promising results by leveraging the vast amount of protein sequence data in a self-supervised way, there is still a gap in exploiting the available 3D protein structures. In this work, we propose a pre-training scheme going beyond trivial masking methods leveraging 3D and hierarchical structures of proteins. We propose a novel self-supervised method to pretrain 3D graph neural networks on 3D protein structures, by predicting the distances between local geometric centroids of protein subgraphs and the global geometric centroid of the protein. By considering subgraphs and their relationships to the global protein structure, our model can better learn the geometric properties of the protein structure. We experimentally show that our proposed pertaining strategy leads to significant improvements up to 6\%, in the performance of 3D GNNs in various protein classification tasks. Our work opens new possibilities in unsupervised learning for protein graph models while eliminating the need for multiple views, augmentations, or masking strategies which are currently used so far.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Metabolic Information into LLMs for Anomaly Detection in Clinical Time-Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in clinical time-series holds significant potential in identifying suspicious patterns in different biological parameters. In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</description>

      <title>Improved prediction of ligand-protein binding affinities by meta-modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03946v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate screening of candidate drug ligands against target proteins through computational approaches is of prime interest to drug development efforts. Such virtual screening depends in part on methods to predict the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Many computational models for binding affinity prediction have been developed, but with varying results across targets. Given that ensembling or meta-modeling approaches have shown great promise in reducing model-specific biases, we develop a framework to integrate published force-field-based empirical docking and sequence-based deep learning models. In building this framework, we evaluate many combinations of individual base models, training databases, and several meta-modeling approaches. We show that many of our meta-models significantly improve affinity predictions over base models. Our best meta-models achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art deep learning tools exclusively based on 3D structures, while allowing for improved database scalability and flexibility through the explicit inclusion of features such as physicochemical properties or molecular descriptors. We further demonstrate improved generalization capability by our models using a large-scale benchmark of affinity prediction as well as a virtual screening application benchmark. Overall, we demonstrate that diverse modeling approaches can be ensembled together to gain meaningful improvement in binding affinity prediction.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based MRI Reconstruction with Artificial Fourier Transform (AFT)-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep complex-valued neural networks provide a powerful way to leverage complex number operations and representations and have succeeded in several phase-based applications. However, most previously published networks have not fully explored the impact of complex-valued networks in the frequency domain. Here, we introduce a unified complex-valued deep learning framework-Artificial Fourier Transform Network (AFTNet)-which combines domain-manifold learning and complex-valued neural networks. AFTNet can be readily used to solve image inverse problems in domain transformation, especially for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction and other applications. While conventional methods only accept magnitude images, the proposed method takes raw k-space data in the frequency domain as input, allowing a mapping between the k-space and image domains to be determined through cross-domain learning. We show that AFTNet achieves superior accelerated MRI reconstruction compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to various tasks, such as denoised magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reconstruction and datasets with various contrasts. The AFTNet presented here is a valuable preprocessing component for different preclinical studies and provides an innovative alternative for solving inverse problems in imaging and spectroscopy. The code is available at: https://github.com/yanting-yang/AFT-Net.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling and prediction of microglial cell dynamics in the ischemic penumbra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroinflammation immediately follows the onset of ischemic stroke. During this process, microglial cells are activated in and recruited to the tissue surrounding the irreversibly injured infarct core, referred to as the penumbra. Microglial cells can be activated into two distinct phenotypes; however, the dynamics between the detrimental M1 phenotype and beneficial M2 phenotype are not fully understood. Using phenotype-specific cell count data obtained from experimental studies on middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced stroke in mice, we employ sparsity-promoting system identification techniques combined with Bayesian statistical methods for uncertainty quantification to generate continuous and discrete-time predictive models of the M1 and M2 microglial cell dynamics. The resulting data-driven models include constant and linear terms but do not include nonlinear interactions between the cells. Results emphasize an initial M2 dominance followed by a takeover of M1 cells, capture potential long-term dynamics of microglial cells, and suggest a persistent inflammatory response.</description>

Abstract: Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms of interest, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate hard-to-interpret or even biologically unrealistic predictions. Out of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred comprise the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Here, focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present a manually-curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied prokaryote Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction, iML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations, as well as a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, here we assess the properties of this model in relation to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, we believe this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for E. coli.</description>
