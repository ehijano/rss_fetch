      <title>Optimised neutron yield calculations from ($\alpha,n$) reactions with the modified SOURCES4 code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of underground experiments searching for rare events such as dark matter, neutrino interactions or several beyond the standard model phenomena is often limited by the background caused by neutrons from spontaneous fission and ($\alpha,n$) reactions. A number of codes exist to calculate neutron yields and energy spectra due to these processes. In this paper we present new calculations of neutron production using the modified SOURCES4A code with recently updated cross-sections for ($\alpha,n$) reactions and the comparison of the results with available experimental data. The cross-sections for ($\alpha,n$) reactions in SOURCES4 have been taken from reliable experimental data where possible, complemented by the calculations with EMPIRE 2.19/3.2.3, TALYS 1.96 or evaluated data library JENDL-5 where the data were scarce or unavailable.</description>

      <title>Search for magnetic monopole pair production in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\textrm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Letter presents a search for highly ionizing magnetic monopoles in 262$~\mu$b$^{-1}$ of ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collision data at $\sqrt{s_{_\textrm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A new methodology that exploits the properties of clusters of hits reconstructed in the innermost silicon detector layers is introduced to study highly ionizing particles in heavy-ion data. No significant excess above the background, which is estimated using a data-driven technique, is observed. Using a nonperturbative semiclassical model, upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the cross-section for pair production of monopoles with a single Dirac magnetic charge in the mass range of 20-150 GeV. The search significantly improves on the previous cross-section limits for production of low-mass monopoles in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Lambda transverse polarization in NA61\SHINE at the CERN SPS: feasibility studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in inclusive reactions with unpolarized protons on unpolarized targets has been studied for almost 40 years. The NA61\SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS has a great potential to study transverse polarization in p-p and p-A collisions. In this work, we discuss the impact of magnetic field and limited detector acceptance on the possible polarization measurement by this experiment. Our analysis shows that the magnetic field impact on the $\Lambda$ polarization due to precession is one order of magnitude smaller than the detector acceptance-based polarization bias, and the identification of an experimental signal similar to that observed before by other experiments is possible.</description>

      <title>New Experimentally Observable Gamma-ray Emissions from 241Am Nuclear Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the high resolution of microcalorimeter detectors, previously unresolvable gamma-ray lines are now clearly resolvable. A careful measurement of Am-241 decay with a large array of gamma-ray microcalorimeters has revealed never before seen or predicted gamma lines at 207.72 +/- 0.02 keV and 208.21 +/- 0.01 keV. These results were made possible by new microwave-multiplexing readout to increase the array size and improved analysis algorithms to eliminate spectral artifacts. We suggest nuclear levels from which these gamma-rays might originate and calculate branching ratios for these transitions from measurements of both mixed Pu-Am standards and a pure Am-241 source. These results have implications for nuclear material safeguards and accounting, particularly for microcalorimeter gamma spectrometers, which are now being adopted in nuclear safeguards analytical laboratories.</description>

      <title>Use of quantality in nuclei and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantality is discussed in the case of nuclei and other many-body systems such as atomic electrons. This dimensionless quantity is known to indicate when a many-body system behaves like a crystal or a quantum liquid. Its role is further analyzed, showing the emergence of a fundamental lengthscale, the limit radius, which corresponds to the hard-core of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the case of nucleons, and to a value close to the Bohr radius in the case of atomic electrons. The occurrence of a cluster phase in nuclei is analyzed using the quantality through its relation to the localization parameter, allowing for the identification of both the number of nucleons and the density as control parameters for the occurrence of this phase. The relation of the quantality to the magnitude of the interaction also exhibits a third dimensionless parameter, monitoring the magnitude of the spin-orbit effect in finite systems, through the realization of the pseudo-spin symmetry. The impact of quantality on the spin-orbit effect is compared in various many-body systems. The role of quantality in the relative effect of the binding energy and the shell one is also analyzed in nuclei. Finally, additional dimensionless quantities are proposed from the generalization of the quantality. Nuclei are found to be exceptional systems because all their dimensionless quantities are close to the order of unity, at variance with other many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study low-energy nuclear physics at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into both processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies.</description>
