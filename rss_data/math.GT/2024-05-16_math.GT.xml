      <title>Knots of low knot Floer width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies the chain homotopy equivalence types of knot Floer complexes $CFK_{\mathbb{F}[U,V]}(K)$ of knot Floer width 2. They have no nontrivial local systems. As an application, this shows that all Montesinos knots admit a basis that can be simultaneously horizontally and vertically simplified.</description>

      <title>Cables of the figure-eight knot via real Fr{\o}yshov invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the $(2n,1)$-cable of the figure-eight knot is not smoothly slice when $n$ is odd, by using the real Seiberg-Witten Fr{\o}yshov invariant of Konno-Miyazawa-Taniguchi. For the computation, we develop an $O(2)$-equivariant version of the lattice homotopy type, originally introduced by Dai-Sasahira-Stoffregen. This enables us to compute the real Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy type for a certain class of knots. Additionally, we present some computations of Miyazawa's real framed Seiberg-Witten invariant for 2-knots.</description>

      <title>Confined subgroups in groups with contracting elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the growth of confined subgroups through boundary actions of groups with contracting elements. We establish that the growth rate of a confined subgroup is strictly greater than half of the ambient growth rate in groups with purely exponential growth. Along the way, several results are obtained on the Hopf decomposition for boundary actions of subgroups with respect to conformal measures. In particular, we prove that confined subgroups are conservative, and examples of subgroups with nontrivial Hopf decomposition are constructed. We show a connection between Hopf decomposition and quotient growth and provide a dichotomy on quotient growth of Schreier graphs for subgroups in hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>On self-affine tiles that are homeomorphic to a ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $3\times 3$ integer matrix which is expanding in the sense that each of its eigenvalues is greater than $1$ in modulus and let $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{Z}^3$ be a digit set containing $|\det M|$ elements. Then the unique nonempty compact set $T=T(M,\mathcal{D})$ defined by the set equation $MT=T+\mathcal{D}$ is called an integral self-affine tile if its interior is nonempty. If $\mathcal{D}$ is of the form $\mathcal{D}=\{0,v,\ldots, (|\det M|-1)v\}$ we say that $T$ has a collinear digit set. The present paper is devoted to the topology of integral self-affine tiles with collinear digit sets. In particular, we prove that a large class of these tiles is homeomorphic to a closed $3$-dimensional ball. Moreover, we show that in this case $T$ carries a natural CW complex structure that is defined in terms of the intersections of $T$ with its neighbors in the lattice tiling $\{T+z\,:\, z\in \mathbb{Z}^3\}$ induced by $T$. This CW complex structure is isomorphic to the CW complex defined by the truncated octahedron.</description>

      <title>Manhattan geodesics and the boundary of the space of metric structures on hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any non-elementary hyperbolic group $\Gamma$, we find an outer automorphism invariant geodesic bicombing for the space of metric structures on $\Gamma$ equipped with a symmetrized version of the Thurston metric on Techim\"uller space. We construct and study a boundary for this space and show that it contains many well-known pseudo metrics including those coming from actions on $\text{CAT}(0)$ cube complexes, real trees and coned-off Cayley graphs. As corollaries we deduce length spectrum rigidity results, regularity results for Manhattan curves, optimal growth rate results for Anosov representations and results regarding continuous extensions of translation distance functions to the space of geodesic currents. Using our results for geodesic currents we settle a conjecture of Bonahon in the negative.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic curves in Stein domains and the tau-invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scope of the paper is threefold. First, we build on recent work by Hayden to compute Hedden's tau-invariant $\tau_{\xi}(L)$ in the case when $\xi$ is a Stein fillable contact structure, and $L$ is a transverse link arising as the boundary of a $J$-holomorphic curve. This leads to a new proof of the relative Thom conjecture for Stein domains. Secondly, we compare the invariant $\tau_\xi$ to the Grigsby-Ruberman-Strle topological tau-invariant $\tau_{\mathfrak s}$, associated to the $\text{Spin}^c$-structure $\mathfrak s=\mathfrak s_\xi$ of the contact structure, to admit topological obstructions for a link type to contain a holomorphically fillable transverse representative. We combine the latter with a result of Mark and Tosun to confirm a conjecture of Gompf: no standardly-oriented Brieskorn homology sphere bounds a rational homology four-ball Stein filling, with any contact structure. Finally, we use our main result together with methods from lattice cohomology to compute the $\tau_{\mathfrak s}$-invariants of certain links in lens spaces, and estimate their PL slice genus.</description>

      <title>Rational curvature invariants for 2-complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New invariants for 2-dimensional cell complexes are defined, which can be interpreted as curvature bounds. These invariants are proved to be rational and computable in a companion article. This document is a survey that collects theorems about these invariants, computes examples, and lays out a programme of conjectures.</description>

      <title>A Weiss-Williams theorem for spaces of embeddings and the homotopy type of spaces of long knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a pseudoisotopy result for embedding spaces in the line of that of Weiss and Williams for diffeomorphism groups. In other words, for $P\subset M$ a codimension at least three embedding, we describe the difference in a range of homotopical degrees between the spaces of block and ordinary embeddings of $P$ into $M$ as a certain infinite loop space involving the relative algebraic $K$-theory of the pair $(M,M-P)$. This range of degrees is the so-called concordance embedding stable range, which, by recent developments of Goodwillie-Krannich-Kupers, is far beyond that of the aforementioned theorem of Weiss-Williams.
  We use this result to give a full description of the homotopy type (away from 2 and up to the concordance embedding stable range) of the space of long knots of codimension at least 3. In doing so, we carry out an extensive analysis of certain geometric involutions in algebraic $K$-theory that may be of independent interest.</description>
