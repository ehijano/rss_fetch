      <title>Inferring CSM Properties of Type II SNe Using a Magnitude-Limited ZTF Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although all Type II supernovae (SNe) originate from massive stars possessing a hydrogen-rich envelope, their light curve morphology is diverse, reflecting poorly characterised heterogeneity in the physical properties of their progenitor systems. Here, we present a detailed light curve analysis of a magnitude-limited sample of 639 Type II SNe from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey. Using Gaussian processes, we systematically measure empirical light curve features (e.g. rise times, peak colours and luminosities) in a robust sampling-independent manner. We focus on rise times as they are highly sensitive to pre-explosion progenitor properties, especially the presence of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) shed by the progenitor in the years immediately pre-explosion. By correlating our feature measurements with physical parameters from an extensive grid of STELLA hydrodynamical models with varying progenitor properties (CSM structure, $\dot M$, $R_{CSM}$ and $M_{ZAMS}$), we quantify the proportion of events with sufficient pre-explosion mass-loss to significantly alter the initial light curve (roughly $M_{CSM} \geq 10^{-2.5} M_{\odot}$) in a highly complete sample of 377 spectroscopically classified Type II SNe. We find that 67 $\pm$ 6\% of observed SNe in our magnitude-limited sample show evidence for substantial CSM ($M_{CSM} \geq 10^{-2.5} M_{\odot}$) close to the progenitor ($R_{CSM} &lt;10^{15}$ cm) at the time of explosion. After applying a volumetric-correction, we find 36$^{+5}_{-7}$\% of all Type II SN progenitors possess substantial CSM within $10^{15}$ cm at the time of explosion. This high fraction of progenitors with dense CSM, supported by photometric and spectroscopic evidence of previous SNe, reveals mass-loss rates significantly exceeding those measured in local group red supergiants or predicted by current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the rapidly emerging field of multi-messenger gravitational lensing - the discovery and science of gravitationally lensed phenomena in the distant universe through the combination of multiple messengers. This is framed by gravitational lensing phenomenology that has grown since the first discoveries in the 20th century, messengers that span 30 orders of magnitude in energy from high energy neutrinos to gravitational waves, and powerful "survey facilities" that are capable of continually scanning the sky for transient and variable sources. Within this context, the main focus is on discoveries and science that are feasible in the next 5-10 years with current and imminent technology including the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network of gravitational wave detectors, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and contemporaneous gamma/X-ray satellites and radio surveys. The scientific impact of even one multi-messenger gravitational lensing discovery will be transformational and reach across fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. We describe these scientific opportunities and the key challenges along the path to achieving them. This article is the introduction to the Theme Issue of the Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A on the topic of Multi-messenger Gravitational Lensing, and describes the consensus that emerged at the associated Theo Murphy Discussion Meeting in March 2024.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer critical advantages over other lensed sources. They can be detected via continuously operating detectors covering most of the sky. They offer extremely high time resolution to determine lensing delays and find short-time delays accurately. They are detectable across most of the visible Universe. However, they are also rare and frequently poorly localized. In this paper, we review searches for gravitational lensing in GRBs and comment on promising avenues for the future. We note that the highly structured jets in GRBs can show variations on sufficiently small scales that, unlike lensing of most transient sources, gravitational lensing in gamma-ray bursts may not be achromatic. Such behavior would weaken the stringent requirements for identifying lensed bursts but would also make robust identification of lensing more challenging. A continuously running search that could identify candidate lensed events in near real-time would enable afterglow searches with current and near-future wide-field optical/IR surveys that could yield the first unambiguous detection of a lensed GRB. The new generation of sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray detectors, such as the Einstein Probe and SVOM, will complement Swift and significantly enhance the number of well-localized gamma-ray and X-ray transients. Tuned strategies could dramatically improve the probability of observing a lensed GRB.</description>

      <title>Comparison of magnetic diffusion and reconnection in ideal and resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, ideal magnetodynamics and resistive force-free electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy astrophysical systems and compact objects are frequently modeled using ideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) or force-free electrodynamic (FFE) simulations, with the underlying assumption that the discretisation from the numerical scheme introduces an effective (numerical) magnetic resistivity that adequately resembles an explicit resistivity. However, it is crucial to note that numerical resistivity can fail to replicate essential features of explicit resistivity. In this study, we compare the 1D resistive decay and 2D reconnection properties of four commonly used physical models. We demonstrate that the 1D Ohmic decay of current sheets via numerical dissipation in both ideal MHD and magnetodynamics (MD) is subdiffusive (i.e., sub-linear in time), whereas explicit resistive FFE and resistive MHD simulations match the predictions of resistive theory adequately. For low-resolution, reconnecting current sheets in 2D, we show that ideal MHD and MD have an analogue to the Sweet--Parker regime where the scaling of the reconnection rate depends directly on the resolution. At high resolutions, ideal MHD and MD have an asymptotic reconnection rate similar to resistive MHD. Furthermore, we find that guide field-balanced current sheets in ideal MHD and MD have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. Similarly, a pressure-balanced current sheet in ideal MHD is found to have a qualitative structure similar to that of one in resistive MHD. For a guide field-balanced sheet, resistive FFE is found to have a nearly identical Sweet--Parker regime compared to resistive MHD and a similar asymptotic reconnection rate for large enough Lundquist numbers, but differs in the timescale for reconnection onset in the asymptotic regime. We discuss the implications of our findings for global simulations.</description>

      <title>GX 340+0: In and Out of Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) enables detailed high-energy X-ray observations from 3--79 keV, but its performance can be constrained by telemetry saturation when observing bright sources, leading to reduced effective exposure times. In this study, we investigate the use of serendipitous stray light (SL) observations to infer properties of an X-ray bright source in comparison to focused data. Our case study is performed on the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 340+0, a prominent Z source, where we execute a spectral analysis comparing 25 SL and 7 focused NuSTAR observations. Our findings demonstrate that SL observations can significantly enhance long-term temporal coverage; detecting variations in the thermal components of the system across the baseline of the mission, which could not be inferred from focused observations alone.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Faraday Effect in Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a type of highly-polarized, millisecond-duration electromagnetic pulses in the radio band, which are mostly produced at cosmological distances. These properties provide a natural laboratory for testing the extreme Faraday effect, a phenomenon in which two different propagation modes of a pulse separate after passing through a dense, highly ionized, and magnetized medium. We derive the critical condition (e.g., rotation measure) for the extreme Faraday effect to occur in FRBs, which exceeds the currently observed maximum value but remains within the theoretically predicted range. Some new features of FRBs (in particular, radio bursts with much shorter durations) after undergoing the extreme Faraday effect are predicted, such as sudden sign reversals of circular polarization, conspicuous frequency drifting, and emergency of extremely high circular polarization degrees. A potential application of this effect in FRBs is that, by comparing morphological differences of the two separated twin modes, one can identify the variations of plasma properties over extremely short timescales along the propagation path. Therefore, if this effect is found with future observations, it would provide a new tool for probing dense, magnetized environments near FRB sources.</description>

      <title>Search for $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud: a new cluster analysis at energies above 4 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) based on the detection of concentrations in the arrival direction Fermi-LAT images of photons at energies higher than 10 GeV found significant evidence for 9 of these sources. This analysis was based on data collected in the time window since August 4 2008 to August, 4 2020 (12 years). In the present contribution, we report results of a new search extended using a 15-year long (up to August, 4 2023) data set and to a broad energy range (higher than 4 GeV). The longer baseline and the softer energy lower limit are required to further understand the relation between the X-ray and gamma ray SNRs in the LMC, and to investigate the completness of the sample at low luminosities. Two different methods of clustering analysis were applied: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), and the combination of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and DENsity-based CLUstEring (DENCLUE) algorithms. We confirm all previous detections and found positive indications for at least 8 new clusters with a spatial correspondence with other SNRs, increasing thus the number of remnants in LMC candidate or detected in the high energy $\gamma$-rays to 16 sources. This study extends previous analyses of $\gamma$-ray emission from SNRs in the LMC by incorporating a longer observational baseline and a broader energy range. The improved dataset and advanced clustering techniques enhance our understanding of the connection between X-ray and $\gamma$-ray SNRs, providing new insights into their high-energy properties, and contributing to assessing the completeness of the sample at lower luminosities.</description>

      <title>Study of Multi-Wavelength Variability, Emission Mechanism and Quasi-Periodic Oscillation for Transition Blazar S5 1803+784</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work present the results of a multi-epoch observational study of the blazar S5\,1803+784, carried out from 2019 to 2023. The analysis is based on simultaneous data obtained from the Swift/UVOT/XRT, ASAS-SN, and Fermi-LAT instruments. A historically high $\gamma$-ray flux observed for this source on march 2022 ($\mathrm{2.26\pm0.062)\times10^{-6}~phcm^{-2}s^{-1}}$. This study investigates the $\gamma$-ray emission from a blazar, revealing a dynamic light curve with four distinct flux states: quiescent and high-flux by using the Bayesian Blocks (BB) algorithm. A potential transient quasi-periodic signal with an oscillation timescale of $\sim$411 days was identified, showing a local significance level surpassing 99.7$\%$ from the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) and Damped Random Walk (DRW) analysis and exceeds 99.5$\%$ from the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) analysis. The observed QPO was confirmed through an autoregressive process (AR(1)), with a significance level exceeding 99$\%$, suggesting a potential physical mechanism for such oscillations involves a helical motion of a magnetic plasma blob within the relativistic jet. Log parabola modeling of the $\gamma$-ray spectrum revealed a photon index ($\alpha_\gamma$) variation of 1.65$\pm$0.41 to 2.48$\pm$0.09 with a steepening slope, potentially indicative of particle cooling, changes in radiative processes, or modifications in the physical parameters. The $\alpha_\gamma$ of 2.48$\pm$0.09 may hint at an evolutionary transition state from BL\,Lac to FSRQ. A comparative analysis of variability across different energy bands reveals that Optical/UV and GeV emissions display greater variability compared to X-rays. Broadband SED modeling shows that within a one-zone leptonic framework, the SSC model accurately reproduces flux states without external Compton contributions, highlighting magnetic fields crucial role.</description>

      <title>Misalignment of the Lense-Thirring precession by an accretion torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Orbiting matter misaligned with a spinning black hole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession, due to the frame-dragging effect. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for type-C QPOs observed in the hard states of low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the accretion flow in these hard states is complex, consisting of a geometrically thick, hot corona surrounded by a geometrically thin, cold disk. Recent simulations have demonstrated that, in such a truncated disk scenario, the precession of the inner hot corona slows due to its interaction with the outer cold disk. Aims: This paper aims to provide an analytical description of the precession of an inner (hot) torus in the presence of accretion torques exerted by the outer (cold) disk. Methods. Using the angular momentum conservation equation, we investigate the evolution of the torus angular momentum vector for various models of accretion torque. Results: We find that, in general, an accretion torque tilts the axis of precession away from the black hole spin axis. In all models, if the accretion torque is sufficiently strong, it can halt the precession; any perturbation from this stalled state will cause the torus to precess around an axis that is misaligned with the black hole spin axis. Conclusions: The accretion torque exerted by the outer thin disk can cause precession around an axis that is neither aligned with the black hole spin axis nor perpendicular to the plane of the disk. This finding may have significant observational implications, as the jet direction, if aligned with the angular momentum axis of the torus, may no longer reliably indicate the black hole spin axis or the orientation of the outer accretion disk.</description>

      <title>The core software and simulation activities for data analysis at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located near the town Malarg\"ue in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, is the largest cosmic-ray detector in existence, covering an area of 3000 km2. The upgraded Observatory, in Phase II of operations, consists of a surface array of 1660 stations combining water Cherenkov, scintillator, and radio detectors. A subset of stations also includes underground muon detectors. Additionally, fluorescence detectors located at four sites overlook the array. The science goals for the enhanced Observatory include the measurement of the properties of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with large statistics and high sensitivity to the primary composition. The Observatory is also sensitive to photons and neutrinos at the highest energies, allowing it to participate in multi-messenger studies. The Auger Offline Framework provides the tools to perform detailed simulations, using the Geant 4 toolkit, of all components of the Observatory and the analysis of both data and simulated events. It proved to have the flexibility needed to evolve during the lifetime of the Observatory, to accommodate new sub-detectors and, recently, changes to the station readout electronics. A new challenge is interfacing the framework with Machine Learning tools for both the development and execution of neural-network-based algorithms. Independent of the framework, CORSIKA 7 is used to simulate particles, fluorescence light, and radio signals produced by air showers. The production of simulations is coordinated centrally to provide standard libraries for analyses and to optimize the use of computing resources. We will describe the evolution and status of the Offline Framework and the tools used to coordinate the simulation efforts. We will also discuss the challenges of the massive simulation efforts and the resources consumed to provide the simulation libraries required by the Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Explaining the UV to X-ray correlation in AGN within the framework of X-ray illumination of accretion discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established that the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray emissions in active galactic nuclei (AGN) are tightly correlated. This correlation is observed both in low- and high-redshift sources. In particular, observations of large samples of quasars revealed the presence of a non-linear correlation between UV and X-rays. The physical origin of this correlation is poorly understood. In this work, we explore this observed correlation in the framework of the X-ray illumination of the accretion disc by a central source. We have shown in previous works that this model successfully explains the continuum UV/optical time delays, variability, and the broadband spectral energy distribution in AGN. We use this model to produce $150,000$ model SEDs assuming a uniform distribution of model parameters. We compute the corresponding UV ($ 2500~\r{A} $) and X-ray (2 keV) monochromatic luminosities and select only the model data points that agree with the observed UV-to-X-ray correlation. Our results show that the X-ray illumination of accretion disc model can reproduce the observed correlation for a subset of model configurations with a non-uniform distribution of black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), accretion rate ($\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$), and power transferred from the accretion disc to the corona ($L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$). In addition, our results reveal the presence of a correlation between $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, and between $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\rm transf}/L_{\rm disc}$, to explain the observed X-ray-UV correlation. We also present evidence based on observed luminosities supporting our findings. We finally discuss the implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Neutrino energy and momentum emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quasi-Dirac neutrinos in diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for signatures of extremely long-baseline oscillations between left- and right-handed neutrinos using the high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectra measured by IceCube. We assume the astrophysical neutrino sources to be distributed in redshift following the star formation rate and use the IceCube all-sky flux measurements from TeV to PeV energies. We find, for the first time, that $\delta m^2$ in the range $2\times 10^{-19}$ to $3 \times 10^{-18}\textrm{eV}^2$ is disfavored at the $3\sigma$ confidence level, while there exists a preference for a $\delta m^2$ of $1.9 \times 10^{-19}\textrm{eV}^2$ at $2.8\sigma$. This preference for quasi-Dirac neutrinos is driven by the tension between cascade and track measurements below $30~\textrm{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical nonlinear tails in Schwarzschild black hole ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear tails in black hole perturbations, arising from second-order effects, present a distinct departure from the well-known Price tail of linear theory. We present an analytical derivation of the power law indices and amplitudes for nonlinear tails stemming from outgoing sources, and validate these predictions to percent-level accuracy with numerical simulations. We then perform a perturbative analysis on the dynamical formation of nonlinear tails in a self-interacting scalar field model, wherein the nonlinear tails are sourced by a $\lambda \Phi^3$ cubic coupling. Due to cascading mode excitations and back-reactions, nonlinear tails with $t^{-l-1}$ power law are sourced in each harmonic mode, dominating the late time behavior of the scalar perturbations. In verification, we conducted numerical simulations of the self-interacting scalar model, including all real spherical harmonic (RSH) with $l\leq 4$ and their respective nonlinear couplings. We find general agreement between the predicted and numerical power law indices and amplitudes for the nonlinear tails, with the exception of $l=4$ modes, which display $t^{-4}$ power law instead of the predicted $t^{-5}$. This discrepancy is due to distortion in the source of the tails, which is caused by another nonlinear effect. These results establish nonlinear tails as universal features of black hole dynamics, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy: they may imprint observable signatures in merger remnants, offering novel probes of strong-field gravity and nonlinear mode couplings.</description>

      <title>Axion dissipation in conductive media and neutron star superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In axion electrodynamics, magnetic fields enable axion-photon mixing. Recent proposals suggest that rotating, conductive plasmas in neutron star magnetospheres could trigger axion superradiant instabilities -- an intriguing idea, given that such instabilities are typically associated with rotating black holes. In this work, we extend these investigations by properly incorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective mass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the conductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in both the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma densities strongly inhibits the axionic instability. While our results assumes flat spacetime, the conclusions also apply to axion bound states in curved spacetimes, making neutron star superradiance less viable than previously thought. As a byproduct of our work, we provide a detailed description of axion electrodynamics in dissipative plasmas and uncover phenomena such as low-frequency axion "tails" and axion-induced electrostatic fields in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>A morphological catalogue of Nova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first optical imaging catalogue of resolved Galactic nova remnants. It compiles images from proprietary observations carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope and public archives using different telescopes and instruments. The catalogue includes images spanning from 1950 to 2024 of 66 novae out of the more than 550 novae detected to date. Diffuse emission from a nova shell is detected in 45 sources, with another 16 sources been stellar and five more been barely resolved. We used the catalogue to introduce a main morphological classification of the nova remnants (R - round, E - elliptical, B - bipolar, A - asymmetric, I - irregular, S - stellar, and G - barely resolved) with secondary features (s - smooth, c - clumpy, m - mixed, f - filaments, t - tails, m - multiple shells, e - equatorial brightness enhancement). Resolved nova remnants are mostly round (27%) or elliptical (56%), with very few bipolar or with equatorial brightness enhancement (13%). Most nova remnants are younger than 150 yr, with about 80% of nova remnant detection rate among those younger than 60 yr. The physical size of nova remnants increases with age at a rate of 0.0725 pc per century up to a median value of 0.03 pc. This relationship seems to apply even to the few known ancient nova shells with ages up to a few millennia. The aspect ratio of nova remnants can be described by a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation $\sigma$ of 0.18 from round morphologies (major to minor axes ratio of unity).</description>

      <title>Sagittarius A* -- The Milky Way Supermassive Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter provides a detailed overview of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, located in the dense Galactic Center region approximately 8 kpc from Earth. Despite its relatively low activity compared to more luminous active galactic nuclei, Sgr A* has provided invaluable insights into black hole physics due to its proximity, enabling high-resolution observations of stellar orbits, gas dynamics, and variable emissions. In addition, Sgr A* illustrates how supermassive black holes influence galaxy evolution through energy feedback and matter redistribution. Early identification as a compact radio source and subsequent measurements of stellar orbits confirmed Sgr A* as a black hole with a mass near 4 million solar masses. Observations of stars moving on tight, short-period orbits around the black hole have allowed direct tests of general relativity, such as gravitational redshift and orbital precession, under the influence of extreme gravitational fields. Sgr A* displays variability across the electromagnetic spectrum, with flares in radio, infrared, and X-rays revealing complex interactions in the accretion flow, while outflows redistribute energy into the surrounding environment. Together, Sgr A* and its environment offer a crucial window into the behavior of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>In-orbit Performance of the Soft X-ray Imaging Telescope Xtend aboard XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a summary of the in-orbit performance of the soft X-ray imaging telescope Xtend onboard the XRISM mission, based on in-flight observation data, including first-light celestial objects, calibration sources, and results from the cross-calibration campaign with other currently-operating X-ray observatories. XRISM/Xtend has a large field of view of $38.5'\times38.5'$, covering an energy range of 0.4--13 keV, as demonstrated by the first-light observation of the galaxy cluster Abell 2319. It also features an energy resolution of 170--180 eV at 6 keV, which meets the mission requirement and enables to resolve He-like and H-like Fe K$\alpha$ lines. Throughout the observation during the performance verification phase, we confirm that two issues identified in SXI onboard the previous Hitomi mission -- light leakage and crosstalk events -- are addressed and suppressed in the case of Xtend. A joint cross-calibration observation of the bright quasar 3C273 results in an effective area measured to be $\sim420$ cm$^{2}$@1.5 keV and $\sim310$ cm$^{2}$@6.0 keV, which matches values obtained in ground tests. We also continuously monitor the health of Xtend by analyzing overclocking data, calibration source spectra, and day-Earth observations: the readout noise is stable and low, and contamination is negligible even one year after launch. A low background level compared to other major X-ray instruments onboard satellites, combined with the largest grasp ($\Omega_{\rm eff}\sim60$ ${\rm cm^2~degree^2}$) of Xtend, will not only support Resolve analysis, but also enable significant scientific results on its own. This includes near future follow-up observations and transient searches in the context of time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Universe: A European Strategy for Axions and other WISPs Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and other very weakly interacting slim (with $m &lt;$ 1 GeV) particles (WISPs) are a common feature of several extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The search of WISPs was already recommended in the last update of the European strategy on particle physics (ESPP). After that, the physics case for WISPs has gained additional momentum. Indeed, WISPs may provide a new paradigm to explain the nature of dark matter and puzzling astrophysical and particle physics observations. This document briefly summarizes current searches for WISPs and the perspectives in this research field for the next decade, ranging from their theoretical underpinning, over their indirect observational consequences in astrophysics, to their search in laboratory experiments. It is stressed that in Europe a rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program is already underway with the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. In this context, it is also reported the role of the EU funded COST Action ''Cosmic WISPers in the Dark Universe: Theory, astrophysics, and experiments'' (CA21106, https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21106) in coordinating and supporting WISPs searches in Europe, shaping a roadmap to track the strategy to guarantee a European leadership in this field of research. This document has been submitted in March 2025 as an input to the update process of the ESPP.</description>

      <title>Common envelopes in massive stars III: The obstructive role of radiation transport in envelope ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty in understanding how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case when recombination energy release is not included. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.</description>

      <title>Spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in optical during the 2022 nova eruption of U Scorpii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There remains debate over whether the accretion disk survives or is entirely disrupted after the nova eruption. In our previous paper, Muraoka et al. (2024, PASJ, 76, 293) have photometrically demonstrated that the surviving accretion disk was expanded close to the L1 point during the optical plateau stage and then drastically shrank to the tidal truncation radius after the optical plateau stage ended. To approach the clarification of the physical mechanism that drives these structural changes, we have then conducted systematic analyses of the spectral evolution of the narrow emission line components in optical over 22 d following the optical peak during the 2022 nova eruption of U Scorpii (U Sco). Additionally, we present its optical spectrum in quiescence 794 d after the 2022 nova eruption. We find that the single-peaked narrow components of H$\alpha$ and He II 4686 appeared almost simultaneously between roughly days 6 and 8, preceding the onset of the disk eclipses observed after day 11. This finding suggests that the nova wind near the binary system may be the primary origin of these narrow components and even remained active several days after the nova eruption with a velocity of approximately 1000 km s$^{-1}$, likely driving the expansion of the accretion disk until the end of the optical plateau stage. While the contribution of the rotating accretion disk might be dominated by that of the nova wind in the H$\alpha$ line profile, the outward surface flow from the expanded disk might also contribute to these narrow features during the optical plateau stage, making the single-peaked narrow line profiles more pronounced.</description>

      <title>To detect strong nugget with an acoustic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses strong nuggets (SNs) which means strong interaction condensed matter clusters with a mass of about $10^6\,$g. They may originate from the early universe, supernova, pulsar merger event, and so on. Depending on the equation of state, the SNs could be stable and even be one of the candidates for dark matter. In order to detect SNs which hitting the Earth or the Moon at a non-relativistic velocity, a new messenger, the acoustic array, is analysed. The results of the calculations show that the impact signal of an SN can be detected at a distance of about 30 kilometers from the nugget's trajectory. By using microphone boxes, hydrophones or seismographs to construct an array in the bedrock, ocean or on the Moon, it is possible to reconstruct the velocity, mass, and interacting cross section of SNs, and then constrain also the nature of supra-nuclear matter. The acoustic array can also be used for distributed acoustic sensing of meteorites or earthquakes. The sonar localisation system on the proposed High-energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) is suggested as a pathfinder for acoustic array detection.</description>

      <title>Immortality through the dark forces: Dark-charge primordial black holes as dark matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that no Hawking radiation from the final stages of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) has yet been observed places stringent bounds on their allowed contribution to dark matter. Concretely, for Schwarzschild PBHs, i.e., uncharged and non-rotating black holes, this rules out black hole masses of less than $10^{-15} M_{\odot}$. In this article, we propose that by including an additional 'dark' $U(1)$ charge one can significantly lower the PBHs' Hawking temperature, slowing down their evaporation process and significantly extending their lifetimes. With this, PBHs again become a viable option for dark matter candidates over a large mass range. We will explore in detail the effects of varying the dark electron (lightest dark charged fermion) mass and charge on the evaporation dynamics. For instance, we will show that by allowing the dark electron to have a sufficiently high mass and/or low charge, our approach suppresses both Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, effectively extending even the lifespan of PBHs with masses smaller than $10^{-15} M_{\odot}$ beyond the current age of the universe. We will finally present a new lower bound on the allowed mass range for dark-charged PBHs as a function of the dark electron charge and mass, showing that the PBHs' mass can get to at least as low as $10^{-24}M_\odot$ depending on the dark electron properties. This demonstrates that the phenomenology of the evaporation of PBHs is ill-served by a focus solely on Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Stellar Mass Estimates to Identify Gravitational Wave Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass can enhance the ranking of potential hosts for compact binary coalescences identified by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors within large localisation areas containing even thousands of galaxies. Despite its benefits, accurate stellar mass estimation is often time-consuming and computationally intensive. In this study, we implement four stellar mass estimation methods based on infrared magnitudes and compare them with values estimated with spectral energy distribution fitting from GAMA DR3, revealing strong correlations. We also introduce a method to calibrate the results from these estimation methods to match the reference values. Our analysis of simulated binary black hole events demonstrates that incorporating stellar mass improves the rank of actual hosts ~80 per cent of cases. Furthermore, the improvement is comparable when stellar masses are derived from the tested estimation methods to when they are obtained directly from the simulated galaxy catalogue, demonstrating that simple stellar mass estimates can provide a computationally efficient alternative.</description>

      <title>A Recent Supermassive Black Hole Binary in the Galactic Center Unveiled by the Hypervelocity Stars</title>

Abstract: When a binary of early-type stars from the young stellar populations in the Galactic center (GC) region is scattered to the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr~$\rm{A}^{*}$, one of the components would be tidally ejected as an early-type hypervelocity star (HVS) and the counterpart would be captured on a tight orbit around Sgr~$\rm{A}^{*}$. Dozens of B-type HVSs moving faster than the Galactic escape speed have been discovered in the Galactic halo and are produced most likely by the SMBH Sgr~$\rm{A}^{*}$. However, the velocity distribution and in particular the deficit of the HVSs above $700\, \rm{km\, s^{-1}}$ is seriously inconsistent with the expectations of the present models. Here we show that the high-velocity deficit is due to the deficiency in close interactions of stars with the SMBH Sgr~$\rm{A}^{*}$, because an orbiting intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of about 15,000 Solar mass kicked away slowly approaching stars 50--250 million years ago. The SMBH-IMBH binary formed probably after the merger of the Milky Way with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus dwarf galaxy, and coalesced about 10 million years ago, leading to a gravitational recoil of Sgr~$\rm{A}^{*}$ at a velocity of 0.3--0.5$\, \rm{km\, s^{-1}}$ and to a change of the HVS ejection scenarios. The SMBH-IMBH binary scenario predicts the formation of the S-star cluster at the GC with the distribution of the orbital size and stellar ages that are well consistent with the observations.</description>

      <title>Late-time HST and JWST Observations of GRB 221009A: Evidence for a Break in the Light Curve at 50 Days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 221009A is one of the brightest transients ever observed with the highest peak gamma-ray flux for a gamma-ray burst (GRB). A type Ic-BL supernova (SN), SN 2022xiw, was definitively detected in late-time JWST spectroscopy (t = 195 days, observer-frame). However, photometric studies have found SN 2022xiw to be less luminous (10-70%) than the canonical GRB-SN, SN 1998bw. We present late-time Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFC3 and JWST/NIRCam imaging of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 221009A at t ~ 185, 277, and 345 days post-trigger. Our joint archival ground, HST, and JWST light curve fits show strong support for a break in the light curve decay slope at t = 50 +/- 10 days (observer-frame) and a supernova at $&lt; 1.5 \times$ the optical/NIR flux of SN 1998bw. This break is consistent with an interpretation as a jet break when requiring slow-cooling electrons in a wind medium with the electron energy spectral index, p &gt; 2, and $\nu_m &lt; \nu_c$. Our light curve and joint HST/JWST spectral energy distribution (SED) also show evidence for the late-time emergence of a bluer component in addition to the fading afterglow and supernova. We find consistency with the interpretations that this source is either a young, massive, low-metallicity star cluster or a scattered light echo of the afterglow with a SED shape of $f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{2.0\pm1.0}$.</description>

      <title>Recovering Pulsar Braking Index from a Population of Millisecond Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The braking index, $n$, of a pulsar is a measure of its angular momentum loss and the value it takes corresponds to different spin-down mechanisms. For a pulsar spinning down due to gravitational wave emission from the principal mass quadrupole mode alone, the braking index would equal exactly 5. Unfortunately, for millisecond pulsars, it can be hard to measure observationally due to the extremely small second time derivative of the rotation frequency, $\ddot{f}$. This paper aims to examine whether it could be possible to extract the distribution of $n$ for a whole population of pulsars rather than measuring the values individually. We use simulated data with an injected $n=5$ signal for 47 millisecond pulsars and extract the distribution using hierarchical Bayesian inference methods. We find that while possible, observation times of over 20 years and RMS noise of the order of $10^{-5}$ ms are needed, which can be compared to the mean noise value of $3\times10^{-4}$ ms for the recent wideband 12.5-year NANOGrav sample, which provided the pulsar timing data used in this paper.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curve Reconstruction: A Comparative Machine and Deep Learning Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed at large redshifts, are probes of the evolution of the Universe and can be used as cosmological tools. To this end, we need tight (with small dispersion) correlations among key parameters. To reduce such a dispersion, we will mitigate gaps in light curves (LCs), including the plateau region, key to building the two-dimensional Dainotti relation between the end time of plateau emission (Ta) to its luminosity (La). We reconstruct LCs using nine models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bi-Mamba, Fourier Transform, Gaussian Process-Random Forest Hybrid (GP-RF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Conditional GAN (CGAN), SARIMAX-based Kalman filter, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and Attention U-Net. These methods are compared to the Willingale model (W07) over a sample of 545 GRBs. MLP and Bi-Mamba outperform other methods, with MLP reducing the plateau parameter uncertainties by 25.9% for log Ta, 28.6% for log Fa, and 37.7% for {\alpha} (the post-plateau slope in the W07 model), achieving the lowest 5-fold cross validation (CV) mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0275. Bi-Mamba achieved the lowest uncertainty of parameters, a 33.3% reduction in log Ta and log Fa and a 41.9% in {\alpha}, but with a higher MSE of 0.130. Bi-Mamba brings the lowest outlier percentage for log Ta and log Fa (2.70%), while MLP carry {\alpha} outliers to 0.900%. The other methods yield MSE values ranging from 0.0339 to 0.174. These improvements in parameter precision are needed to use GRBs as standard candles, investigate theoretical models, and predict GRB redshifts through machine learning.</description>

      <title>Advection Algorithms for Quantum Neutrino Moment Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino transport in compact objects is an inherently challenging multi-dimensional problem. This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor transformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow the coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of complex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact objects that include neutrino transport often make use of momentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly referred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be generalized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments. Numerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for classical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a Riemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in terms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We then test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor instability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from neutron star merger simulations. Compared to previous algorithms for neutrino transport with flavor mixing, we find uniformly smaller growth rates of the flavor transformation along with concomitantly larger length-scales, and that the results are a better match with the growth rates seen from multi-angle codes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave inference of star cluster properties from intermediate-mass black hole mergers</title>

Abstract: Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will observe mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) out to high redshift. Such IMBHs can form through runaway tidal encounters in the cores of dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we ask if the gravitational wave observation of a single merger event between two IMBHs, occurring in the aftermath of the coalescence of the clusters in which they formed, can be used to infer the properties of their host clusters, such as mass, redshift, and half-mass radius. We implement an astrophysically motivated analytic model for cluster evolution and IMBH growth, and we perform IMBH binary parameter estimation using a network of three next-generation detectors. We find that inferring the structural properties of clusters in this way is challenging due to model degeneracy. However, the posteriors on the cluster formation redshifts have relatively narrow peaks, and it may still be possible to infer the cluster formation history by measuring a whole population of IMBH binary merger events.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration announced the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without predefined LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>

      <title>Discrete treatment of inverse Compton scattering: implications on parameter estimation in gamma-ray astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gamma-ray astronomy and cosmic-ray physics, the continuous approximation of inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is widely adopted to model the evolution of electron energy. However, when the initial electron energy approaches $\sim100$ TeV, the discrete nature of ICS becomes prominent, and the energy of evolved electrons should be considered as a broad distribution rather than a deterministic value. By simulating the evolution paths of individual electrons under ICS, we capture this discrete nature and demonstrate that when the electron injection spectrum exhibits a high-energy cutoff, the correct discrete treatment yields a higher cutoff energy in the evolved spectrum compared to the continuous approximation. Applying the discrete ICS treatment to interpret the gamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga pulsar halo measured by HAWC, we find that the inferred cutoff energy of the injection spectrum is correspondingly lower than that derived using the continuous approximation at a $95\%$ confidence level. This suggests that the systematic bias introduced by the approximation has exceeded the measurement precision. We also expect the application of the discrete ICS correction in the PeV regime using the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J1954+2836u as a case study, pointing out that adopting the continuous approximation may considerably overestimate the electron acceleration capability of the source.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>Supernova production of axion-like particles coupling to electrons, reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to electrons at tree-level in a relativistic plasma. We explicitly demonstrate the equivalence between pseudoscalar and derivative couplings, incorporate previously neglected processes for the first time-namely, semi-Compton production ($\gamma e^-\rightarrow a e^-$) and pair annihilation ($e^+e^-\rightarrow a\gamma$)-and derive analytical expressions for the bremsstrahlung ($e^- N\to e^- N a$) production rate, enabling a more computationally efficient evaluation of the ALP flux. Additionally, we assess uncertainties in the production rate arising from electron thermal mass corrections, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. The ALP emissivity is made available in a public repository as a function of the ALP mass, the temperature, and the electron chemical potential of the plasma. Finally, we examine the impact of ALP production and subsequent decays on astrophysical observables, deriving the leading bounds on ALPs coupling to electrons. At small couplings, the dominant constraints come from the previously neglected decay $a\to e^+ e^-\gamma$, except for a region of fireball formation where SN 1987A X-ray observations offer the best probe. At large couplings, bounds are dominated by the energy deposition argument, with a recently developed new prescription for the trapping regime.</description>
