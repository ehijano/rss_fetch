      <title>Electronic dimensionality of UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the heavy-fermion metal UTe2 survives the application of very high magnetic fields, presenting both an intriguing puzzle and an experimental challenge. The strong, non-perturbative influence of the magnetic field complicates the determination of superconducting order parameters in the high-field phases. Here, we report electronic transport anisotropy measurements in precisely aligned microbars in magnetic fields to 45 T applied along the b-axis. Our results reveal a highly directional vortex pinning force in the field-reinforced phase. The critical current is significantly suppressed for currents along the c direction, whereas the flux-flow voltage is reduced with slight angular misalignments--hallmarks of vortex lock-in transitions typically seen in quasi-2D superconductors like cuprates and pnictides. These findings challenge the assumption of nearly isotropic charge transport in UTe2 and point to enhanced two-dimensionality in the high-field state, consistent with a change in the order parameter. A pair-density-wave-like state at high fields could naturally induce a layered modulation of the superfluid density, forming planar structures that confine vortices and guide their sliding in the flux-flow regime.</description>

      <title>DFT exploration of pressure dependent physical properties of the recently discovered La3Ni2O7 superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under pressure has drawn a lot of interest. La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</description>

      <title>Multimagnon and multispinon $L_3$-edge RIXS spectra of an effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multimagnon and the multispinon $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra of a spin-1/2 effective $\tilde{J}_1-\tilde{J}_2-\tilde{J}_3$ square lattice Heisenberg model in its N\'{e}el ordered phase. Motivated by the observation of satellite intensity peaks above the single magnon dispersion in the $L$-edge RIXS spectrum, we propose a resonating valence bond (RVB) inspired RIXS mechanism that incorporates the local site ultrashort core-hole lifetime (UCL) expansion. We compute the multimagnon and the multispinon excitations using $\mathcal{O}(1/S)$ interacting spin wave theory and Schwinger boson mean-field theory (SBMFT) formalism, respectively. We treat the x-ray scattering process up to second order in the UCL expansion. Our calculations of two-magnon, bimagnon, and three-magnon RIXS intensities reveal that interacting spin wave theory fails to fully capture all the quantum correlations in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase. However utilizing the SBMFT framework, with a ground state that combines N\'{e}el order and fluctuating RVB components, we demonstrate that a RIXS bond-flipping mechanism provides an alternative deeper physical explanation of the satellite intensities. Specifically, we find that the spin correlation spectra predicted by the fluctuating RVB mechanism aligns with higher order UCL expansion results. We further show that the satellite intensity above the single-magnon mode can originate both from a one-to-three-magnon hybridization vertex process and from condensed spinons exhibiting Higgs mechanism. These features reflect the interplay of quantum fluctuation, entanglement, and gauge interaction effects of quantum magnetism probed by RIXS.</description>

      <title>Detector of microwave photon pairs based on a Josephson photomultiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a viable design of a microwave two-photon threshold detector. In essence, the considered scheme is an extension of the existing single-photon detector - a Josephson photomultiplier (JPM) - an absorbing microwave detector based on a capacitively-shunted rf SQUID. To implement a two-photon threshold detector, we utilize a dimer of resonators - two lumped-element resonators interacting via an asymmetric dc SQUID, with one of the resonators capacitively coupled to the JPM. By specific tuning of the resonator frequencies and the external flux through the dc SQUID coupler, we engineer a non-perturbative two-photon coupling between the resonators. This coupling results in the coherent conversion of a photon pair from one resonator into a single photon in another resonator, enabling selective response to quantum states with at least two photons. We also consider an extended coupler design that allows on-demand \textit{in situ} switching of two-photon coupling. In addition, we propose the modified JPM design to improve its performance. Our calculations demonstrate that, for realistic circuit parameters, we can achieve more than $99\%$ fidelity of photon pair detection in less than 50 ns. The considered scheme may serve as a building block for the implementation of efficient photon-number-resolving detectors in circuit QED architecture.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of Tc for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal Tc. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport theory for unconventional magnets: Interplay of altermagnetism and p-wave magnetism with superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum transport theory for generic magnetic metals, in which magnetism occurs predominantly due to exchange interactions, such as ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, altermagnets and p-wave magnets. Our theory is valid both for the normal and the superconducting state. We derive the effective low-energy action for each of these materials, where the spin space groups are used to determine the form of the tensor coefficients appearing in the action. The transport equations, which are obtained as the saddle point equations of this action, describe a wider range of phenomena than the usual quasiclassical equations. In ferromagnets, in addition to the usual exchange field and spin relaxation effects, we identify a spin-dependent renormalization of the diffusion coefficient, which provides a description of spinpolarized currents in both the normal and superconducting equal spin-triplet states. In the normal state, our equations provide a complete description of the spin-splitting effect in diffusive systems, recently predicted in ideal clean altermagnets. In the superconducting state, our equations predict a proximity induced magnetization, the appearance of a spontaneous magnetic moment in hybrid superconductor-altermagnet systems. The distribution and polarization direction of this magnetic moment depend on the symmetry of the structure, thus measurements of such polarization reveal the underlying microscopic symmetry of the altermagnet. Finally, for inversionsymmetry broken antiferromagnets, such as the p-wave magnet, we show that spin-galvanic effects which are distinguishable from the spin-galvanic effect induced by spin-orbit coupling only in the superconducting state. Besides these examples, our model applies to arbitrary magnetic systems, providing a complete theory for nonequilibrium transport in diffusive nonconventional magnets at arbitrary temperatures.</description>

      <title>Edge modes in chiral electron double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticles in chiral double layers with electron pairing within the framework of the Bogoliubov de Gennes equation. In the presence of an edge it is demonstrated that the quasiparticle modes can be distinguished as edge modes and bulk modes, which appear at different energies. The bulk-edge correspondence is obtained by an analytic continuation from the in-gap edge modes to the bands of bulk modes. By varying the energy we find a transition from localized edge modes to delocalized bulk modes. We calculate the quasiparticle currents, discuss briefly how these currents couple to external currents, and predict how this can be used to control the quasiparticle modes.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows steplike features on the resistance under magnetic fields. These resistance steps are resulted from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the superconducting proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, show an unusual dependence on the magnitude of the uniaxial strain ($\epsilon$), indicating their connection with surface states. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal $\rightarrow$ strong topological insulator $\rightarrow$ trivial insulator, and supports the presence of surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 0.85\%$.</description>

      <title>A New Type of MPd5 Kagome Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome materials, which are composed of hexagons tiled with a shared triangle, have inspired enormous interest due to their unique structures and rich physical properties, but exploring superconducting material systems with new kagome structures is still an important research direction. Here, we predict a new type of kagome superconductors, MPd5 (M is a group IIA metal element), and identify that they exhibit coexistence of superconductivity and non-trivial topological properties. We uncover their phonon-mediated superconductivity by the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT), predicting the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of 2.64, 2.03, and 1.50 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively, which can be effectively tuned by external pressure and electron doping. The present results also demonstrate that MPd5 have various topological properties such as, CaPd5 shows topological non-trivial intersection near the Fermi level (EF). Our results indicate that the MPd5 materials can be an emerging material platform with rich exotic physics in their kagome structures, and render themselves excellent candidates for superconducting and advanced functional materials that could be utilized in topological quantum computing and information technology.</description>

      <title>Electric transport in doped Mott insulators dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the ``confinement'' of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $ \delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>$t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states raising the on-site Coulomb energy and derive resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.</description>
