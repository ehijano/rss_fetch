      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Lensed Quasar Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensed quasars are key to many areas of study in astronomy, offering a unique probe into the intermediate and far universe. However, finding lensed quasars has proved difficult despite significant efforts from large collaborations. These challenges have limited catalogues of confirmed lensed quasars to the hundreds, despite theoretical predictions that they should be many times more numerous. We train machine learning classifiers to discover lensed quasar candidates. By using semi-supervised learning techniques we leverage the large number of potential candidates as unlabelled training data alongside the small number of known objects, greatly improving model performance. We present our two most successful models: (1) a variational autoencoder trained on millions of quasars to reduce the dimensionality of images for input to a gradient boosting classifier that can make accurate predictions and (2) a convolutional neural network trained on a mix of labelled and unlabelled data via virtual adversarial training. These models are both capable of producing high-quality candidates, as evidenced by our discovery of GRALJ140833.73+042229.98. The success of our classifier, which uses only images, is particularly exciting as it can be combined with existing classifiers, which use other data than images, to improve the classifications of both models and discover more lensed quasars.</description>

      <title>The Rizzeta Stone: Adopting Gen-$\alpha$ Colloquial Language to Improve Scientific Paper Rizz and Aura from a Skibidi Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of astronomy evolves rapidly, and it is essential to keep up with these changes in order to effectively communicate with the broader community. However, communication itself also changes as new words, phrases, and slang terms enter the common vernacular. This is especially true for the current youngest generations, who are capable of efficiently communicating via the Internet. In order to maintain effective communication, we explore the possibility of expanding the language used in scientific communication to include recently coined slang. This attempt at outreach, while potentially very difficult, could provide a means to expand the field and capture the attention of early-career scientists, improving retention within the field. However, our results indicate that, while possible, this method of communication is, like, probably not really worth it, no cap.</description>

      <title>Direction-Dependent Faraday Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radio interferometers enable high-resolution polarization imaging, offering insights into cosmic magnetism through Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis. Traditional 2+1D RM synthesis treats the 2D spatial and 1D spectral transforms separately. A fully 3D approach transforms data directly from visibility-frequency space to sky-Faraday depth space using a 3D Fourier transform. Faraday synthesis uses the full dataset for improved reconstruction but requires a 3D deconvolution algorithm to subtract artifacts from the residual image. Applying this method to modern interferometers also requires corrections for direction-dependent effects (DDEs). We extend Faraday synthesis by incorporating DDE corrections, enabling accurate polarized imaging in the presence of instrumental and ionospheric effects. We implement this method within DDFACET, introducing a direction-dependent deconvolution algorithm (DDFSCLEAN) that applies DDE corrections in a faceted framework. Additionally, we parameterize the CLEAN components and evaluate the model over a larger set of frequency channels, naturally correcting for bandwidth depolarization. The method is tested on both synthetic and real data. Our results show that Faraday synthesis enables deeper deconvolution, reduces artifacts, and increases dynamic range. The depolarization correction improves recovery of polarized flux, allowing coarser frequency resolution without loss of sensitivity at high Faraday depths. From the 3D reconstruction, we identify a polarized source in a LOFAR Surveys pointing not detected by earlier RM surveys. Faraday synthesis is memory-intensive due to the large transforms between the visibility domain and the Faraday cube, and is only now becoming practical. Nevertheless, our implementation achieves comparable or faster runtimes than the 2+1D approach, making it a competitive alternative for polarization imaging.</description>

      <title>New candidate polymeric wavelength shifters for noble liquid detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymeric wavelength shifters are of particular interest for large liquid argon detectors. Inspired by the success of polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), other new polymers exhibiting a similar type of excimer fluorescence were investigated. We report on the preliminary results of the first cryogenic wavelength shifting test of a solution-cast film of PVN, poly(2-vinyl naphthalene). Significant brittleness was identified as a factor potentially limiting the use of PVN. However, clear signs of wavelength shifting were observed, with the overall efficiency and time response comparable to those of PEN.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Imaging of Interferometric Data from Polarized Electromagnetic Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an imaging algorithm for polarimetric interferometric data from radio telescopes. It is based on Bayesian statistics and thereby able to provide uncertainties and to incorporate prior information such as positivity of the total emission (Stokes I) or consistency constraints (polarized fraction can only be between 0% and 100%). By comparing our results to the output of the de-facto standard algorithm called CLEAN, we show that these constraints paired with a consistent treatment of measurement uncertainties throughout the algorithm significantly improve image quality. In particular, our method reveals that depolarization canals in CLEAN images do not necessarily indicate a true absence of polarized emission, e.g., after frequency averaging, but can also stem from uncertainty in the polarization direction. This demonstrates that our Bayesian approach can distinguish between true depolarization and mere uncertainty, providing a more informative representation of polarization structures.</description>

      <title>The Case for High Resolution Spectroscopy in the Ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Astro2020 Decadal Survey declared that the baryon cycle is one of the top-priority science topics for current astrophysics. Space instruments with both high spectral resolution and high throughput in the ultraviolet are required for investigations of low density warm and cold gas present in both the \underline{inner} regions of the baryon cycle (interstellar medium, star-exoplanet interactions, pre-main sequence stars, stellar winds, flows and structures driven by supernovae) and the \underline{outer} regions (outflows of matter and energy from galaxies, circumgalactic media). The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on HST has pioneered such studies, but STIS has its limitations and the lifetime of HST is limited. There is a pressing need for future large instruments with high spectral resolution ($R\approx 100,000$) in the 120--320~nm wavelength band such as the present STIS E140H and E230H capabilities, but with increased throughput to study gas in sight lines to faint sources such as M dwarf stars and circumgalactic clouds. Multi-object spectroscopy at high spectral resolution could enhance observational efficiency. This document describes some of the scientific results obtained with STIS and the new science that an enhanced instrument on a large telescope such as HWO could accomplish. We provide examples of the resolution needed for these science investigations.</description>

      <title>Karabo: A versatile SKA Observation Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00303v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Karabo is a versatile Python-based software framework simplifying research with radio astronomy data. It bundles existing software packages into a coherent whole to improve the ease of use of its components. Karabo includes useful abstractions, like strategies to scale and parallelize typical workloads or science-specific Python modules. The framework includes functionality to access datasets and mock observations to study the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) instruments and their expected accuracy. SKA will address problems in a wide range of fields of astronomy. We demonstrate the application of Karabo to some of the SKA science cases from HI intensity mapping, mock radio surveys, radio source detection, the epoch of re-ionisation and heliophysics. We discuss the capabilities and challenges of simulating large radio datasets in the context of SKA.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Triangular-Toothed Gears on the Functionality of the Antikythera Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Antikythera Mechanism is based on a complex system of interconnected gears. Recent analyses have highlighted the influence of triangular tooth profiles and manufacturing inaccuracies on its performance. This study combines Alan Thorndike's analytical solution for the non-uniform motion caused by triangular teeth with Mike Edmunds' error model accounting for manufacturing imprecisions. We developed a computational program to simulate the behavior of the mechanism's pointers, integrating variables from both models. Since the impact of these variables is speculative, our results must be interpreted with caution. Our findings indicate that while the triangular shape of the teeth alone produces negligible errors, manufacturing inaccuracies significantly increase the likelihood of gear jamming or disengagement. Under our assumptions, the errors identified by Edmunds exceed the tolerable limits required to prevent failures. Consequently, either the mechanism never functioned or its actual errors were smaller than those reported by Edmunds. Although it seems unlikely that someone would build such a complex yet non-functional device, there are strong reasons to question whether Edmunds' values accurately reflect the mechanism's original errors.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Shifts in the Dark Current of Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark count rate is one of the key properties of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Previous studies have reported discrete shifts in the dark count rate on short timescales ~10 ms to ~100 s with small increases (up to ~1 kHz per APD). In this study, we report a similar yet distinct phenomenon in the dark current of SiPMs designed for gamma-ray telescopes. Long-term stability tests (&gt;100 days) revealed bimodal or multimodal dark current shifts of the order of 0.1 uA on timescales of days in 48 out of 128 SiPM channels. In addition, optical emission was observed from an APD surface when the dark current was in a high state. These findings suggest that multimodal dark current behavior is a common property of SiPMs, which may be due to defects in the silicon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) have become vital for space missions enabling rapid data processing, advanced pattern recognition, and enhanced insight extraction. These tools are especially valuable in astrobiology applications, where models must distinguish biotic patterns from complex abiotic backgrounds. Advancing the integration of autonomy through AI and ML into space missions is a complex challenge, and we believe that by focusing on key areas, we can make significant progress and offer practical recommendations for tackling these obstacles.</description>

      <title>PyLongslit: a simple manual Python pipeline for processing of astronomical long-slit spectra recorded with CCD detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new Python pipeline for processing data from astronomical long-slit spectroscopy observations recorded with CCD detectors. The pipeline is designed to aim for simplicity, manual execution, transparency and robustness. The goal for the pipeline is to provide a manual and simple counterpart to the well-established semi-automated and automated pipelines. The intended use-cases are teaching and cases where automated pipelines fail.
  From raw data, the pipeline can produce the following output:
  * A calibrated 2D spectrum in counts and wavelength for every detector pixel.
  * A 1D spectrum extracted from the 2D spectrum in counts per wavelength (for point-like objects).
  * A flux-calibrated 1D spectrum (for point-like objects).
  The products are obtained by performing standard procedures for detector calibrations (Howell, 2006; Richard Berry, 2005), cosmic-ray subtraction (McCully et al., 2018; van Dokkum, 2001), and 1D spectrum extraction (Bradley et al., 2024; Horne, 1986).

      <title>UVIT Data Release version 7: Regenerated high-level UVIT data products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat is an active telescope capable of high-resolution far-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5'') and low resolution (${\lambda}/{\delta}{\lambda}$ $\approx$ 100) slitless spectroscopy with a field of view as large as ~0.5 degrees. Now almost a decade old, UVIT continues to be operational and generates valuable data for the scientific community. UVIT is also capable of near-ultraviolet imaging (&lt;1.5''); however, the near-ultraviolet channel stopped working in August 2018 after providing data for nearly three years. This article gives an overview of the latest version (7.0.1) of the UVIT pipeline and UVIT Data Release version 7. The high-level products generated using pipeline versions having a major version number of seven will be called "UVIT Data Release version 7". The latest pipeline version overcomes the two limitations of the previous version (6.3), namely (a) the inability to combine all episode-wise images and (b) the failure of the astrometry module in a large fraction of the observations. The procedures adopted to overcome these two limitations, as well as a comparison of the performance of this new version over the previous one, are presented in this paper. The UVIT Data Release version 7 products are available at the Indian Space Science Data Center of the Indian Space Research Organisation for archival and dissemination from 01 June 2024. The new pipeline version is open source and made available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry and Dynamical Constraints in 2-Limbs Retrieval of WASP-39 b Inferring from JWST Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy has provided unprecedented insight into the makeup of exoplanet atmospheres. A transmission spectrum contains contributions from a planet's morning and evening limbs, which can differ in temperature, composition and aerosol properties due to atmospheric circulation. While high-resolution ground-based observations have identified limb asymmetry in several ultra-hot/hot exoplanets, space-based studies of limb asymmetry are still in their early stages. The prevalence of limb asymmetry across a broad range of exoplanets remains largely unexplored. We conduct a comparative analysis of retrievals on transmission spectra, including traditional 1D approaches and four 2D models that account for limb asymmetry. Two of these 2D models include our newly proposed dynamical constraints derived from shallow-water simulations to provide physically-motivated temperature differences between limbs. Our analysis of WASP-39 b using JWST observations and previous combined datasets (HST, VLT, and Spitzer) strongly favors 2D retrievals over traditional 1D approaches, confirming significant limb asymmetry in this hot Jupiter. Within our 2D framework, unconstrained models recover larger temperature contrasts than dynamically-constrained models, with improved fits to specific spectral features, although Bayesian evidence cannot definitively distinguish between these 2D approaches. Our results support the presence of homogeneous C/O in both the morning and evening atmospheres, but with temperature differences leading to variations in clouds and hazes. Using this treatment, we can study a larger sample of hot Jupiters to gain insights into atmospheric limb asymmetries on these planets.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphology Classification via Deep Semi-Supervised Learning with Limited Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology classification plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. With galaxy observation data growing exponentially, machine learning has become a core technology for this classification task. However, traditional machine learning methods predominantly rely on supervised learning frameworks, and their dependence on large of labeled samples limits practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative hybrid semi-supervised model, GC-SWGAN, designed to tackle galaxy morphology classification under conditions of limited labeled data. This model integrates semi-supervised generative adversarial networks (SGAN) with Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP), establishing a multi-task learning framework. Within this framework, the discriminator and classifier are designed independently while sharing part of the architecture. By collaborating with the generator, the model significantly enhances both classification performance and sample generation capabilities, while also improving convergence and stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that, on the Galaxy10 DECals dataset, GC-SWGAN achieves comparable or even superior classification accuracy (exceeding 75%) using only one-fifth of the labeled samples typically required by conventional fully supervised methods. Under identical labeled conditions, the model displays excellent generalization performance, attaining approximately 84% classification accuracy. Notably, in extreme scenarios where only 10\% of the data is labeled, GC-SWGAN still achieves high classification accuracy (over 68%), fully demonstrating its stability and effectiveness in low-labeled data environments. Furthermore, galaxy images generated by GC-SWGAN are visually similar to real samples.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning for cosmological emulation: Rapid adaptation to new lensing kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical computation of cosmological observables is an intensive process, restricting the speed at which cosmological data can be analysed and cosmological models constrained, and therefore limiting research access to those with high performance computing infrastructure. Whilst the use of machine learning to emulate these computations has been studied, most existing emulators are specialised and not suitable for emulating a wide range of observables with changing physical models. Here, we investigate the Model-adaptive Meta-Learning algorithm (MAML) for training a cosmological emulator. MAML attempts to train a set of network parameters for rapid fine-tuning to new tasks within some distribution of tasks. Specifically, we consider a simple case where the galaxy sample changes, resulting in a different redshift distribution and lensing kernel. Using MAML, we train a cosmic-shear angular power spectrum emulator for rapid adaptation to new redshift distributions with only $O(100)$ fine-tuning samples, whilst not requiring any parametrisation of the redshift distributions. We compare the performance of the MAML emulator to two standard emulators, one pre-trained on a single redshift distribution and the other with no pre-training, both in terms of accuracy on test data, and the constraints produced when using the emulators for cosmological inference. We observe that within an MCMC analysis, the MAML emulator is able to better reproduce the fully-theoretical posterior, achieving a Battacharrya distance from the fully-theoretical posterior in the $S_8$ -- $\Omega_m$ plane of 0.008, compared to 0.038 from the single-task pre-trained emulator and 0.243 for the emulator with no pre-training.</description>

      <title>Green computing toward SKA era with RICK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Square Kilometer Array is expected to generate hundreds of petabytes of data per year, two orders of magnitude more than current radio interferometers. Data processing at this scale necessitates advanced High Performance Computing (HPC) resources. However, modern HPC platforms consume up to tens of M W , i.e. megawatts, and energy-to-solution in algorithms will become of utmost importance in the next future. In this work we study the trade-off between energy-to-solution and time-to-solution of our RICK code (Radio Imaging Code Kernels), which is a novel approach to implement the w-stacking algorithm designed to run on state-of-the-art HPC systems. The code can run on heterogeneous systems exploiting the accelerators. We did both single-node tests and multi-node tests with both CPU and GPU solutions, in order to study which one is the greenest and which one is the fastest. We then defined the green productivity, i.e. a quantity which relates energy-to-solution and time-to-solution in different code configurations compared to a reference one. Configurations with the highest green productivities are the most efficient ones. The tests have been run on the Setonix machine available at the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre (PSC) in Perth (WA), ranked as 28th in Top500 list, updated at June 2024.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Implies a Coupled Dark Sector: Insights from DESI DR2 via a Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $2.2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI's evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of multi-parameter likelihoods through iteration of two-dimensional slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a method for resolving multi-parameter likelihoods by fixing all parameter values, but two. Evaluation of those two variables is followed by iteratively cycling through each of the parameters in turn until convergence. We test the technique on the temperature power spectrum of the lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB). That demonstration is particularly effective since one of the six parameters that define the power spectra, the power spectrum amplitude, $A_{s}$, nears linearity at small deviations, reducing computation to incrementation in one-dimension, rather than over a 2D grid. At each iterative step $A_{s}$ is paired with a different parameter. The iterative process yields parameter values in agreement with those derived by \textit{Planck}, and results are obtained within a few hundred calls for spectra. We further compute parameter values as a function of maximum multipole, $\ell_{\text{max}}$, spanning a range from $\ell_{\text{max}}$=959 to 2500, and uncover bi-modal behavior at the lower end of that range. In the general case, in which neither variable is linear, we identify moderating factors, such as changing both parameters each iterative step, reducing the number of steps per iteration. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation has been the dominant instrument for evaluating multi-parameter functions. For applications with a quasi-linear variable such as, $A_s$, the 2D iterative method is orders of magnitude more efficient than MCMC.</description>

      <title>Evaluating small vision-language models as AI assistants for radio astronomical source analysis tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation radio telescopes is set to transform radio astronomy by producing massive data volumes that challenge traditional processing methods. Deep learning techniques have shown strong potential in automating radio analysis tasks, yet are often constrained by the limited availability of large annotated datasets. Recent progress in self-supervised learning has led to foundational radio vision models, but adapting them for new tasks typically requires coding expertise, limiting their accessibility to a broader astronomical community. Text-based AI interfaces offer a promising alternative by enabling task-specific queries and example-driven learning. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs), with their remarkable zero-shot capabilities, are increasingly used in scientific domains. However, deploying large-scale models remains resource-intensive, and there is a growing demand for AI systems that can reason over both visual and textual data in astronomical analysis. This study explores small-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as AI assistants for radio astronomy, combining LLM capabilities with vision transformers. We fine-tuned the LLaVA VLM on a dataset of 59k radio images from multiple surveys, enriched with 38k image-caption pairs from the literature. The fine-tuned models show clear improvements over base models in radio-specific tasks, achieving ~30% F1-score gains in extended source detection, but they underperform pure vision models and exhibit ~20% drop on general multimodal tasks. Inclusion of caption data and LoRA fine-tuning enhances instruction-following and helps recover ~10% accuracy on standard benchmarks. This work lays the foundation for future advancements in radio VLMs, highlighting their potential and limitations, such as the need for better multimodal alignment, higher-quality datasets, and mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Near-instantaneous Atmospheric Retrievals and Model Comparison with FASTER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the dramatic improvement in the spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres demands a corresponding leap forward in our ability to analyze them: atmospheric retrievals need to be performed on thousands of spectra, applying to each large ensembles of models (that explore atmospheric chemistry, thermal profiles and cloud models) to identify the best one(s). In this limit, traditional Bayesian inference methods such as nested sampling become prohibitively expensive. We introduce FASTER (Fast Amortized Simulation-based Transiting Exoplanet Retrieval), a neural-network based method for performing atmospheric retrieval and Bayesian model comparison at a fraction of the computational cost of classical techniques. We demonstrate that the marginal posterior distributions of all parameters within a model as well as the posterior probabilities of the models we consider match those computed using nested sampling both on mock spectra, and for the real NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of WASP-39b. The true power of the FASTER framework comes from its amortized nature, which allows the trained networks to perform practically instantaneous Bayesian inference and model comparison over ensembles of spectra -- real or simulated -- at minimal additional computational cost. This offers valuable insight into the expected results of model comparison (e.g., distinguishing cloudy from cloud-free and isothermal from non-isothermal models), as well as their dependence on the underlying parameters, which is computationally unfeasible with nested sampling. This approach will constitute as large a leap in spectral analysis as the original retrieval methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo have proven to be.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ADITYA L1, India's first dedicated mission to study Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on September 2, 2023 with seven payloads. Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on ADITYA-L1. VELC has provision to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in continuum at 5000{\AA}, with the field of view (FoV) from 1.05$R_\odot$ to 3$R_\odot$ can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303{\AA} [Fe XIV], 7892{\AA} [Fe XI], and 10747{\AA} [Fe XIII] are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50${\mu}$m, separated by 3.75mm helps to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to ${\pm}$1.5$R_\odot$ with variable step size. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747{\AA} also in the FoV range 1.05-1.5$R_\odot$. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time. Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>

      <title>Beijing Normal University 12-meter Interferometric kHz GW Detector Prototype: Design and Scientific Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new window into the universe, enabling the study of extreme astrophysical phenomena that are otherwise obscured in traditional electromagnetic observations. While global efforts have predominantly focused on low- and mid-frequency GW detection, the high-frequency regime, particularly in the kilohertz (kHz) range, remains underexplored despite its potential to reveal critical insights into compact binary mergers, neutron star physics, and other exotic astrophysical sources. In this context, the Beijing Normal University (BNU) prototype represents a pioneering effort to develop a dedicated kHz GW detector. Featuring a 12-meter L-shaped resonator within a two-arm vacuum system, the BNU prototype is designed to test innovative configurations and address key technical challenges for kHz GW detection. Beyond its primary focus on being a technology testbed and demonstrator for kHz detection, the prototype is also being evaluated for its own sensitivity in the megahertz (MHz) range, offering the potential to explore even higher-frequency signals from e.g., primordial black holes and geontropic fluctuations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the BNU prototype, detailing its design, key components, and scientific objectives.</description>
