      <title>Searching for String Bosenovas with Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of string bosenova explosions in vector superradiance clouds around spinning black holes, focusing on the observable consequences in gravitational wave detectors and accelerometers. During the growth of the superradiance cloud, the dark gauge field might reach a critical field strength, when a network of dark photon strings is produced via a superheated phase transition. These dark photon strings will then absorb the energy in the background fields and get ejected from the cloud, with total energy as large as the rotational energy of the black hole. In this paper, we study the subsequent evolution of this dense string network, and the resulting observational consequences depending on the unknown string tension, or almost equivalently, the ratio between the quartic and the gauge coupling in the Abelian Higgs model. Strings with large tension will dissipate into gravitational waves, detectable over a wide range of frequencies, from $\sim$ nHz near supermassive black holes, to $\gtrsim 10$ MHz around stellar mass black holes. This is the first known source of high frequency gravitational waves, unconstrained by cosmological observations. The strain of this gravitational wave can be larger than $10^{-14}$ at low frequencies, lasting for longer than typical duration of experiments. Small tension strings, with total lengths in the network as large as $10^{40}$ km, can travel to the earth with appreciable rate from any black hole in the Milky Way and interact with earth based accelerometers. If the Standard Model particles are directly charged under the dark photon, e.g. B-L, this interaction leads to an acceleration of Standard Model particles that is independent of the coupling constant. We work out the spectral density of this acceleration, and project that modern accelerometers and equivalence principle tests can be sensitive to the passing of these strings.</description>

      <title>Theoretical underpinnings of CP-Violation at the High-energy Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general analysis for the discovery potential of CP-violation (CPV) searches in scattering processes at TeV-scale colliders in an effective field theory framework, using the SMEFT basis for higher dimensional operators. In particular, we systematically examine the CP-violating sector of the SMEFT framework in some well motivated limiting cases, based on flavour symmetries of the underlying heavy theory. We show that, under naturality arguments of the underlying new physics (NP) and in the absence of (or suppressed) flavour-changing interactions, there is only a single operator, $Q_{t\phi} = \phi^\dagger \phi \left(\bar q_3 t \right) \tilde{\phi} $ which alters the top-Yukawa coupling, that can generate a non-vanishing CP-violating effect from tree-level SM$\times$NP interference terms. We find, however, that CPV from $Q_{t\phi} = \phi^\dagger \phi \left(\bar q_3 t \right) \tilde{\phi} $ is expected to be at best of $O(1\%)$ and, therefore, very challenging if at all measurable at the LHC or other future high-energy colliders. We then conclude that a potentially measurable CP-violating effect of $O(10\%)$ can arise in high-energy scattering processes ONLY if flavour-changing interactions are present in the underlying NP; in this case a sizable CPV can be generated at the tree-level by pure NP$\times$NP effects and not from SM$\times$NP interference. We provide several examples of CPV at the LHC and at a future $e^+e^-$ collider to support these statements.</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation in exclusive $b\to d\ell_i\ell_j$ and $b\to s\ell_i\ell_j$ decay modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the exclusive lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays modes based on $b\to d\ell_i\ell_j$ and $b\to s\ell_i\ell_j$ by considering the ground state mesons and baryons. After spelling out the expressions for such decay rates in a low energy effective theory which includes generic contributions arising from physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), we show that the experimental bounds on meson decays can be used to bound the corresponding modes involving baryons. We find, for example, $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b\to \Lambda\mu\tau)\lesssim 4\times 10^{-5}$. We also consider two specific models and constrain the relevant LFV couplings by using the low energy observables. In the first model we assume the Higgs mediated LFV and find the resulting decay rates to be too small to be experimentally detectable. We also emphasize that the regions favored by the bounds $\mathcal{B}(h\to\mu\tau)^\mathrm{Atlas}$ and $\mathcal{B}(h\to e\tau)^\mathrm{Atlas}$ are not compatible with $\mathcal{B}(\mu\to e\gamma)^\mathrm{MEG}$ to $1\sigma$. In the second model we assume LFV mediated by a heavy $Z'$ boson and find that the corresponding $b$-hadron branching fractions can be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$, thus possibly within experimental reach at LHCb and Belle~II.</description>

      <title>Test of Bell Locality Violation in Flavor Entangled Neutral Meson Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-spin entanglement of neutral mesons to test the Bell nonlocality is systematically studied. In the case of CP violation, the concrete expression of the Bell inequality for entangled neutral meson pairs is derived. The violation of Bell inequality in the oscillations of $B_d^0-\bar{B}_d^0$, $B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0$, $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ and $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ meson pair systems are found at certain evolution time including the latest experimental data. Our study is helpful for studying CP-violating involved flavor entanglement and testing Bell inequality violation in the current and future high energy experiment facilities.</description>

      <title>Cold nuclear matter effects on azimuthal decorrelation in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption of factorization lies at the core of calculations of medium effects on observables computable in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. In this work we examine this assumption, for which we propose a setup to study hard processes and bulk nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions on the same footing using the Glauber modelling of heavy nuclei. To exemplify this approach, we calculate the leading-order corrections to azimuthal decorrelation in Drell-Yan and boson-jet processes due to cold nuclear matter effects, not considering radiation. At leading order in both the hard momentum scale and the nuclear size, the impact-parameter dependent cross section is found to factorize for both processes. The factorization formula involves a convolution of the hard cross section with the medium-modified parton distributions, and, for boson-jet production, the medium-modified jet function.</description>

      <title>Experiments and phenomenology of electric dipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) is the best description of fundamental particles and their interactions we have to date. From this theory, all phenomena in the macroscopic world (except for gravity) can be explained, and it has successfully predicted all outcomes of particle experiments on Earth. However, cosmological observations of the early Universe yield a large imbalance between its content of matter and antimatter, which is several orders of magnitude above the SM prediction. To explain these observations, new interactions that do not respect the charge-parity symmetry must exist beyond the SM. Such interactions would induce electric dipole moments (EDMs) in known particles.
  In Part I of this thesis, we propose to extend the active experimental program of EDM searches to charm and bottom baryons, $\tau$ leptons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons; also allowing the measurement of their corresponding magnetic dipole moments (MDMs). The EDM and MDM of short-lived particles can be accessed with a bent-crystal experiment to be installed in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), while longer-lived $\Lambda$ particles can be measured at the LHCb experiment with no additional instrumentation. In Part II, an analysis of LHCb data to measure the $\Lambda$ polarization in $\Lambda_c^+ \to \Lambda \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ decays, essential ingredient for the proposed measurement, is presented. In the last part of the thesis, we derive new indirect bounds on heavy quark EDMs with already available data and explore the phenomenological implications of these and other EDM limits on New Physics models, with special emphasis on extensions of the SM with colour-octet scalars.</description>

      <title>Determination of the multipole moments of the $J^P = 3^-$ mesons via QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipole moments of the $J^P = 3^-$ tensor mesons are obtained using the light cone sum rules. Our results on multipole moments are compared with the predictions of light-cone helicity formalism within SU(3) flavor symmetry, and it is observed that the results in both approaches are quite compatible with each other. The obtained multipole moments of tensor mesons provide deeper insights into their properties and understanding of the strong and electromagnetic decay channels of these mesons.</description>

      <title>Hunting for the prospective $T_{cc}$ family based on the diquark-antidiquark configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instigated by the first $T_{cc}$ observation at the LHCb Collaboration, the spectroscopic properties of the entire isoscalar and isovector $T_{cc}$ family are systematically unveiled by means of multiple sorts of relativized and nonrelativistic diquark formalisms, encompassing the Godfrey-Isgur relativized diquark model, the modified Godfrey-Isgur relativized diquark model incorporating the color screening effects, the nonrelativistic diquark model with the Gaussian type hyperfine potential, and the nonrelativistic diquark model with the Yukawa type hyperfine potential. The theoretical outcomes of various diquark-antidiquark scenarios are inclined to categorize the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ structure as the exemplary candidate of the $1S$-wave isoscalar axial-vector double-charm tetraquark state. In light of the diquark-antidiquark configuration, this work investigates the mixing angles of the orbitally excited isovector $T_{cc}$ states and the magic mixing angles of the ideal heavy-light tetraquarks for the first time. As the advancement of the experimental detection capability, these phenomenological prognostications will effectively boost the hunting for the prospective low-lying $T_{cc}$ states in the future.</description>

      <title>Studies of $Z$ boson decay into double $\Upsilon$ mesons at the NLO QCD accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the nonrelativistic QCD factorization to conduct a comprehensive examination of the $Z$ boson decay into a pair of $\Upsilon$ mesons, achieving accuracy at the next-to-leading-order (NLO) in $\alpha_s$. Our calculations demonstrate that the QED diagrams are indispensable in comparison to the pure QCD diagrams, and the implementation of QCD corrections markedly enhance the QCD results, whereas it substantially diminish the QED results. To ensure consistency with the experimental methodology, we have taken into account the feed-down transitions originating from higher excited states, which exhibit significant relevance. Combining all the contributions, we arrive at the NLO prediction of $\mathcal{B}_{Z \to \Upsilon(nS)+\Upsilon(mS)} \sim 10^{-11}$, which is notably lower than the upper limits set by CMS.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic form factors and spin polarization of $\Lambda_c^+$ in the process $e^+ e^- \to \Lambda^+_c \bar{\Lambda}^-_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total cross sections of the process $e^+ e^-\to \Lambda_c^+ \bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ close to the threshold are calculated within the vector meson dominance model. It is found that the theoretical results can describe the current experimental measurements. In particular, the results for the angular distribution parameters about the differential cross section are consistent with the experiments from BESIII Collaboration. In addition, the relative phase $\Delta \Phi$ of the electromagnetic form factors was given, and the spin polarization of $\Lambda_c^+$ is predicted at center-mass energy $4.7 \ \rm GeV$. It is hopeful to provide a new perspective on the characteristics of the charmed baryon $\Lambda_c^+$.</description>

      <title>Hidden and double charm-strange tetraquarks and their decays in a potential quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of the $1S$-wave hidden and double charm-strange tetraquarks $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ and $cc\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in a nonrelativistic potential quark model framework with the explicitly correlated Gaussian method, and the mass spectra, color-spin configurations and possible decay modes are obtained. We find that although these states are all above their open flavor thresholds, their rearrangement decay widths are rather narrow which can be understood by the mismatching of the wave functions between the initial and final states. It implies that the tetraquarks of $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ and $cc\bar{s}\bar{s}$ may have a good chance to exist as genuine tetraquark states. It also shows that the color-spin configurations of the $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ and $cc\bar{s}\bar{s}$ systems are quite different. We find that for a physical state of $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ its color configurations can be dominated by either the $|11\rangle_{c}$ or $|88\rangle_{c}$ ones. It suggests that some hidden charm-strange tetraquark states may strongly couple to two color-singlet hadrons if the kinematics and dynamics allow. In contrast, we find that the color configurations $|11\rangle_{c}$ and $|88\rangle_{c}$ in a double charm-strange $cc\bar{s}\bar{s}$ state are rather compatible. It may suggest that an overall color-singlet tetraquark (i.e. a genuine color-singlet) should always play a role in the $T_{cc\bar{s}\bar{s}}$ states. Discussions taking into account some experimental candidates are presented, and suggestions on further experimental searches are also made.</description>

      <title>Disentangling left-handed and right-handed neutrino effects in $B_c \to \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the anomalies in $B\to D^{(*)} \tau \bar{\nu}_\tau$ decay, in this work, we carefully study the influence of the most general dimension-six effective operators involving right-handed neutrinos on the four cascade decays $B_c \to \tau(\to \nu_\tau h ) \bar{\nu}_\tau $ ($h=\pi,\rho$) and $B_c \to \tau(\to \nu_\tau \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell) \bar{\nu}_\tau $ ($\ell =\mu, e$). We calculate for the first time the analytical results of the distributions of the differential decay rates of these cascade decays with respect to the energy of the charged particles in the final state. We select a total of 13 new physics benchmark points, among which 9 are derived from the effect of purely left-handed neutrinos, and the other 4 are from the effect of purely right-handed neutrinos. We find that the benchmark points BP4, BP6, BP9, BP11, and BP13 can significantly increase the values of these distributions while the BP3 causes a sharp decrease in these distributions. The end-point behavior of the differential distribution $d\Gamma/dE_\pi$ can be used to disentangle the effects of left-handed and right-handed neutrinos. Finally, in order to eliminate the uncertainties brought by the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$ and the decay constant $f_{B_c}$, we introduce the normalized distributions $d\Gamma/(\Gamma dE_a)$ ($a=\pi,\rho,\mu,e$), which are only sensitive to the right-handed neutrinos. We find that in each normalized distribution there exists a fixed point that is not related to any dimension-six effective operators considered in this work.</description>

      <title>Revisiting gauge invariance and Reggeization of pion exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reggeized pion is expected to provide the main contribution to the forward cross section in light meson photoproduction reactions with charge exchange at high energies. We discuss the Reggeization of pion exchange in charged pion photoproduction with an emphasis on consistency with current conservation. We show that the gauge-invariant amplitude for the exchange of a particle with generic even spin $J\geq 2$ in the $t$-channel is analytic at $J=0$, and that it can be interpreted in terms of the nucleon electric current. This enables us to reconcile the dynamics in the $s$- and $u$-channel, which involves also nucleon exchanges, with the amplitude expressed in terms of $t$-channel partial waves, as required by Regge theory.</description>

      <title>Common Origin of Dark Matter and Leptogenesis in $U(1)_{B-L}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. This model involves a complex scalar $\phi$, sterile neutrinos $N$, and Majorana dark matter $\chi$, where only dark matter $\chi$ is charged under the $Z_2$ symmetry. Masses of $N$ and $\chi$ are generated via the Yukawa interactions to $\phi$ after breaking of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. TeV scale sterile neutrinos $N$ are responsible for the generation of baryon asymmetry through the resonance leptogenesis mechanism. The new particles in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ have a significant impact on the dilution of $N$, thus on leptogenesis. Meanwhile, the annihilation processes of dark matter $\chi$ are almost identical to that of $N$, which indicates that both leptogenesis and dark matter are closely related to satisfying the observed results simultaneously. Under various theoretical and experimental constraints, the viable common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis is obtained for both global and local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Charged lepton flavour violation from inverse seesaw with flavour and CP symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study charged lepton flavour violation in a scenario in which light neutrino masses are generated via the inverse seesaw mechanism with 3+3 gauge singlet fermions, Ni and Sj, i,j=1,2,3. Lepton mixing is predicted with the help of the flavour symmetries Delta (3 n^2) and Delta (6 n^2) combined with CP. In the neutral lepton sector, the non-trivial flavour structure is only encoded in the Dirac neutrino Yukawa matrix (the coupling relating left-handed lepton doublets and gauge singlets Ni). Current experimental bounds on the processes mu -&gt; e gamma, mu -&gt; 3 e, mu-e conversion in nuclei and the tau lepton decays tau -&gt; l gamma and tau -&gt; 3 l, l=e, mu, do not constrain the considered parameter space of this scenario. Prospective limits on the decay mu -&gt; 3 e and mu-e conversion in aluminium instead can markedly reduce the available parameter space. We also comment on the effects of the heavy sterile states on light neutrino masses and lepton mixing.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD axion dark matter with transmon qubits and quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a direct axion dark matter (DM) search using superconducting transmon qubits as quantum sensors. With an external magnetic field applied, axion DM generates an oscillating electric field which causes the excitation of the qubit; such an excitation can be regarded as a signal of the axion DM. We provide a theoretical consideration of the excitation process of the qubits taking into account the effects of the shielding cavity surrounding the qubits and estimate the signal rate for the axion DM detection. We also discuss the enhancement of the DM signal by using cavity resonance and entangled quantum sensors realized by a quantum circuit. Combining these two effects, we can reach the parameter region suggested by QCD axion models.</description>

      <title>Probing Charm Yukawa through $ch$ Associated Production at the Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, the study of the charm-quark Yukawa coupling at the Large Hadron Collider mainly restricts the coupling constant $y_c$ through the Higgs decay channels. Such signal suffers from overwhelming QCD background, and derives most sensitivity from the $Vh$ associated production channel. In addition, sensitivity to a possible CP complex term of $y_c$ is lost. We study the $ch$ associated production channel at the HL-LHC and FCC to probe the charm Yukawa coupling. By making use of the interference contribution among channels, and machine learning techniques to separate the different contributions, sensitivity on possible deviation from a standard model charm Yukawa coupling is derived. Under the $\kappa$ framework, a 1$\sigma$ projected bounds of $\kappa_c &lt; 5.62$ (HL-LHC) and $-1.52 &lt; \kappa_c &lt; 1.62$ (FCC) are achieved. When further allowing for CP-structure for the charm Yukawa, and comparing with other complementary hadron collider signals, we reach projected bounds on the CP-odd and CP-even components of the charm Yukawa of $-2.46 &lt; \tilde{\kappa_c} &lt; 2.46$, $ 0.23 &lt; \kappa_c &lt; 1.74$ at the HL-LHC and $-1.05 &lt; \tilde{\kappa_c} &lt; 1.05$, $ 0.57 &lt; \kappa_c &lt; 1.28$ at the FCC.</description>

      <title>Accelerating template generation in resonant anomaly detection searches with optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Resonant Anomaly Detection with Optimal Transport (RAD-OT), a method for generating signal templates in resonant anomaly detection searches. RAD-OT leverages the fact that the conditional probability density of the target features vary approximately linearly along the optimal transport path connecting the resonant feature. This does not assume that the conditional density itself is linear with the resonant feature, allowing RAD-OT to efficiently capture multimodal relationships, changes in resolution, etc. By solving the optimal transport problem, RAD-OT can quickly build a template by interpolating between the background distributions in two sideband regions. We demonstrate the performance of RAD-OT using the LHC Olympics R\&amp;D dataset, where we find comparable sensitivity and improved stability with respect to deep learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Large pseudoscalar Yukawa couplings in the complex 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LHC's Run3 unfolds, we peer deeper into the couplings of the 125GeV Higgs ($h_{125}$) and also test for extra scalars. Even before such extra scalars are found, one can probe them by using the fact that theories with multiple Higgs doublets allow for substantial deviations of the couplings of $h_{125}$ from their SM values. Indeed, the observed couplings already place stringent limits on such theories. We investigate the curious possibility that $h_{125}$ couples to the top quark mostly as a scalar, while it couples to the bottom quark mostly as a pseudoscalar. This possibility was allowed by 2017 data for the so-called C2HDM; a two Higgs doublet model with a single source of explicit CP violation. It was shown recently that this possibility disappears when using the full experimental data of 2024. Here we discuss a three Higgs doublet with explicit CP violation (C3HDM), and show that the curious CP-even/CP-odd $t$/$b$ possibility is partly resuscitated, prompting further experimental exploration of this prospect.</description>

      <title>QCD jets in a hot and dense medium: a study of shower formation time and collision kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the use of MARTINI, a model which considers evolving QCD jets against a fluid dynamical background, it is shown that the introduction of formation time to the parton shower after the initial hard scattering is essential for a simultaneous description of charged hadron and jet $R_{AA}$. This inclusion also improves jet shape ratio at small angle and jet fragmentation function ratios of leading charged hadrons. The MARTINI framework is then aimed at a study of the leading order, next-to-leading-order, and non perturbative collision kernels. Sizable differences in the modification of jet substructure observables, i.e., jet shape and fragmentation functions are observed. Such differences are caused by the difference in the radiation rates of relatively soft gluons that survive in the evolution in medium.</description>

      <title>Irreducible cosmological backgrounds of a real scalar with a broken symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the irreducible cosmological implications of a singlet real scalar field. Our focus is on theories with an approximate and spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry where quasi-stable domain walls can form at early times. This seemingly simple framework bears a wealth of phenomenological implications that can be tackled by means of different cosmological and astrophysical probes. We elucidate the connection between domain wall dynamics and the production of dark matter and gravitational waves. In particular, we identify three main benchmark scenarios. The gravitational wave signal observed by pulsar timing arrays can be generated by the domain walls if the mass of the singlet is $m_s \sim\,$PeV. For lower masses, but with $m_s \gtrsim 10\,$GeV, scalars produced in the annihilation of the domain walls can be dark matter with a distinctive feature in their power spectrum. Finally, the thermal bath provides an unavoidable source of unstable scalars via the freeze-in mechanism whose subsequent decays can be tested by their imprints on cosmological and terrestrial observables.</description>

      <title>Likely existence of bound states and the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\psi$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-breaking discovery of the first fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$ in the $J/\psi J/\psi$ invariant mass distribution by the LHCb collaboration has inspired intensive theoretical studies. Various interpretations, such as molecular states, compact tetraquark states, and coupled-channel effects, have been proposed for these states. Of particular interest is the ongoing search for the triple-$J/\psi$ state--a fully-charmed hexaquark state. To deepen our understanding of the triple-$J/\psi$ state and to guide future experimental searches, we study the triple-$J/\psi$ system in this work employing the Gaussian expansion method and the $J/\psi J/\psi$ potential parameterized to yield a shallow bound state, as suggested in several theoretical works. Our results support a triple-$J/\psi$ bound state, even in cases where the attractive interaction between the two $J/\psi$ mesons is very weak. Moreover, our analysis implies the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\psi$ system. In addition, we extend our investigation to the triple-$\Upsilon (1S)$ system and obtain results similar to those for the triple-$J/\psi$ system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalars and pseudoscalars with masses in the MeV to GeV range are of interest in different extensions of the Standard Model. Such particles are often associated with dark matter, the strong CP problem and the $\left(g-2\right)_{\mu}$ anomaly. In this work we investigate limits for masses of such particles and their couplings to photons and leptons which can be derived from present and future $e^+e^-$ collider experiments and current $\left(g-2\right)_{l}$ measurements. Our work expands upon previous studies in several ways, demonstrating that the interplay of both couplings is a decisive factor in this type of analyses.</description>

Abstract: We survey on-shell and off-shell higher derivative supergravities in dimensions $1\le D\le 11$. Various approaches to their construction, including the Noether procedure, (harmonic) superspace, superform method, superconformal tensor calculus, $S$-matrix and dimensional reduction, are summarized. Primarily the bosonic parts of the invariants and the supertransformations of the fermionic fields are provided. The process of going on-shell, solutions to the Killing spinor equations, typical supersymmetric solutions, and the role of duality symmetries in the context of $R^4, D^4 R^4$ and $D^6 R^4$ invariants are reviewed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that black holes in a quark gluon plasma (QGP) obeying minimum viscosity bounds, exhibit a Schwarzschild radius in close match with the range of the strong force. For such black holes, an evaporation time of about 1016 secs is estimated, indicating that they would survive by far the quark-gluon plasma era, namely between 10^-10 and 10^-6 seconds after the big bang. On the assumption that the big-bang generated unequal amounts of quark and antiquarks, this suggests that such unbalance might have survived to this day in the form of excess antiquark nuggets hidden to all but gravitational interactions. A connection with the saturon picture, whereby minimum viscosity regimes would associate with the onset coherent quantum field structures with maximum storage properties, is also established, along with potential implication for quantum computing of classical systems.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of four-dimensional type II supergravities, the successive application of various S/T-dualities leads to a generalized notion of fluxes, which includes certain (non-)geometric fluxes along with the standard RR and NS-NS p-form fluxes. These fluxes induce a diverse set of superpotential couplings leading to scalar potentials with a very rich structure, which may possibly result in a vast landscape of physical vacua. However such scalar potentials typically consist of a huge number of terms and in order to make any attempt for phenomenological model building with some analytic understanding/control it is necessary to formulate them in some compact and concise form. Along these lines we review various equivalent methods of deriving the same scalar potential through a set of master formulae, which may open up a new avenue for model building using non-geometric fluxes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the feasibility of the experimental determination of the width of a $D$ meson in a nuclear medium by using the method of the nuclear transparency. The cross section for inclusive production of a $D^+$ in different nuclei is evaluated, taking care of the $D^+$ absorption in the nucleus, or equivalently, the survival probability of the $D^+$ in its way out of the nucleus from the point of production. We use present values of the in medium width of $D$ mesons and calculate ratios of the cross sections for different nuclei to the $^{12} \text{C} $ nucleus as reference. We find ratios of the order of $0.6$ for heavy nuclei, a large deviation from unity, which indicates that the method proposed is adequate to measure this relevant magnitude, so far only known theoretically.</description>

Abstract: We examine the most realistic class of models among the 33 candidates in the complete landscape of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models arising from intersecting D6-branes on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in type IIA string theory. The class is characterized by twelve Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector that precisely account for the Standard Model fermion masses and mixings without Wilson fluxes. Notably, there is a natural prediction of Dirac neutrino-masses with normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.1)$~meV consistent with both experimental constraints and swampland bounds.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light dark matter with non-canonical kinetics reopening the mass window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the fuzzy dark matter mass window from high-redshift observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of high-redshift observables to extract the strongest constraints to date on the fraction of axion fuzzy dark matter (FDM) in the mass window $10^{-26}\,\mathrm{eV}\!\lesssim\! m_\mathrm{FDM}\!\lesssim\!10^{-23}\,\mathrm{eV}$. These observables include ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) at redshifts $4-10$ measured by the Hubble Space Telescope, a constraint on the neutral hydrogen fraction from high-redshift quasar spectroscopy, the cosmic microwave background optical depth to reionization measurement from Planck and upper bounds on the 21cm power spectrum from HERA. In order to calculate these signals for FDM cosmology, we use the 21cmFirstCLASS code to interface between AxiCLASS and 21cmFAST and consistently account for the full cosmic history from recombination to reionization. To facilitate a full Bayesian likelihood analysis, we developed a machine-learning based pipeline, which is both accurate, and enables a swift statistical inference, orders of magnitude faster than a brute force approach. We find that FDM of mass $m_\mathrm{FDM} \!= \!10^{-23} \, \mathrm{eV}$ is bound to less than $16\%$ of the total dark matter, where the constrains strengthen towards smaller masses, reaching down to $1\%$ for $m_\mathrm{FDM}\! =\! 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{eV}$, both at $95\%$ confidence level. In addition, we forecast that a future detection of the 21cm power spectrum with HERA will lower the upper bound at $m_\mathrm{FDM}\! =\! 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to $\lesssim\!1\%$.</description>

      <title>Proving the absence of large one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations in transient ultra-slow-roll inflation within the path-integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of curvature perturbations $\zeta$ in an inflationary scenario containing a transient ultra-slow-roll (USR) period. In Ref.[1], it was argued that one-loop corrections to the power spectrum of $\zeta$ can be larger than the tree-level one within the parameter region generating the seeds of primordial black holes during the USR epoch, which implies the breakdown of perturbation theory. We prove that this is not the case by using a master formula for one-loop corrections to the power spectrum obtained in Ref.[2]. We derive the same formula within the path-integral formalism, which is simpler than the original derivation in [2]. To show the smallness of one-loop corrections, the consistency relations and the effective constancy of tree-level mode functions of $\zeta$ for super-Hubble modes play essential roles, with which the master formula gives a simple expression for one-loop corrections. For concreteness, we provide a reduced set of interactions including the leading-order one, while establishing the consistency relations in a self-consistent manner. We also show how the consistency relations of various operators hold explicitly, which plays a key role in proving the absence of large one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>Meson-nucleus bound states in quark meson coupling model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formations of the $K(\bar{K})$, $D(\bar{D})$, and $B(\bar{B})$ meson-nucleus bound states in $^{16}O$, $^{40}Ca$, $^{90}Zr$, $^{197}Au$, and $^{208}Pb$ nucleus are investigated using the quark meson coupling model. The model relies on a mean field description of non-overlapping nucleon bags bound by the self-consistent interactions of scalar ($\sigma$, $\delta$) and vector ($\omega$, $\rho$) mesons with the (anti)quarks inside the bags, which is further extended to explore the properties of nuclei. We estimate the meson-nucleus bound state energies by solving the Klein-Gordon equations with the real potentials calculated self-consistently within the model, using a coordinate space approach. The calculations are carried out for different nuclear interactions. The effects of Coulomb interaction are considered in the present study for the charged mesons. Our study indicates the formation of rather deeply bound $B$-mesic states at the very central region of the nuclei, compared to the $D$ and $K$ mesons, offering a more promising probe to explore subtle nuclear medium effects. The investigations of such bound states are of particular interest for the upcoming $\rm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ at FAIR, J-PARC-E29 and JLab experiments.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy of Non--Supersymmetric $\bm{\tilde{S}}$ Heterotic String Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the free fermionic formulation of the heterotic-string in four dimensions to study the vacuum structure and energy of non-supersymmetric tachyon free models that correspond to compactifications of tachyonic vacua of the ten dimensional heterotic-string. We explore the class of heterotic $SO(10)$ non-supersymmetric models constructed from the $\tilde{S}$-model in the Free Fermionic Formalism, and investigate the dependence of the potential on the geometric moduli. This paper will explore a sample of $ 10^{9}$ string vacua to find the frequency of viable models, classifying these vacua by the following fertility criteria: tachyon presence; number of spinorial $\boldsymbol{16/\overline{16}}$ representations; vectorial $\boldsymbol{10}$ states; Top Quark Mass Coupling compatibility. Of these we find those that mimic supersymmetric models with equal number of bosons and fermions at the massless level - $a_{00} = 0$. Tachyon free models occur with a frequency of $5.309\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, models that fulfil the rest of the phenomenological fertility conditions and the additional condition on $a_{00}$ occur with probability $4.0 \times 10^{-9}$ We analyse the partition functions and study the moduli dependence of such models, finding that almost all fertile models have finite, positive potential at the Free Fermionic Point, with $2$ out of $84$ of the fertile cores having negative, finite potential. We demonstratate that the Free Fermionic Point is not necessarily a minimum in the potential. This work provides further evidence that supersymmetry may not be a necessary ingredient of phenomenological models, recreating many of the desirable features of such models without employing supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Investigation of kaonic atom optical potential by the high precision data of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Impact of Parameters in the Blazar Jet Magnetic Field Model on Axion-Like Particle Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons induces ALP-photon oscillations in astrophysical magnetic fields, leading to spectral distortions in the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of blazars. The primary uncertainty of this phenomenon may originate from the magnetic field within the jet of the blazar. While many studies have explored the effects of ALP-photon oscillations using typical values for jet magnetic field parameters, it is important to recognize that these parameters can be constrained by multi-wavelength observations. In this study, we utilize the high energy $\gamma$-ray spectrum of Mrk 421 obtained from MAGIC and Fermi-LAT observations. By employing multi-wavelength fitting with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model, we derive the parameters characterizing the magnetic field model within the jet, and investigate their impacts on the ALP constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize two geometrical approaches to analytically evaluate higher-fold Mellin-Barnes (MB) integrals in terms of hypergeometric functions. The first method is based on intersections of conic hulls, while the second one, which is more recent, relies on triangulations of a set of points. We demonstrate that, once automatized, the triangulation approach is computationally more efficient than the conic hull approach. As an application of this triangulation approach, we describe how one can derive simpler hypergeometric solutions of the conformal off-shell massless two-loop double box and one-loop hexagon Feynman integrals than those previously obtained from the conic hull approach. Lastly, by applying the above techniques on the MB representation of multiple polylogarithms, we show how to obtain new convergent series representations for these functions. These new analytic expressions were numerically cross-checked with GINAC.</description>

      <title>On the EFT of Dyon-Monopole Catalysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monopole-fermion (and dyon-fermion) interactions provide a famous example where scattering from a compact object gives a cross section much larger than the object's geometrical size. This underlies the phenomenon of monopole catalysis of baryon-number violation because the reaction rate is much larger in the presence of a monopole than in its absence. It is sometimes claimed to violate the otherwise generic requirement that short distance physics decouples from long-distance observables -- a property that underpins the general utility of effective field theory (EFT) methods. Decoupling in this context is most simply expressed using point-particle effective field theories (PPEFTs) designed to capture systematically how small but massive objects influence their surroundings when probed only on length scales large compared to their size. These have been tested in precision calculations of how nuclear properties affect atomic energy levels for both ordinary and pionic atoms. We adapt the PPEFT formalism to describe low-energy $S$-wave dyon-fermion scattering with a view to understanding whether large catalysis cross sections violate decoupling (and show why they do not). We also explore the related but separate issue of the long-distance complications associated with polarizing the fermion vacuum exterior to a dyon and show in some circumstances how PPEFT methods can simplify calculations of low-energy fermion-dyon scattering in their presence. We propose an effective Hamiltonian governing how dyon excitations respond to fermion scattering in terms of a time-dependent vacuum angle and outline open questions remaining in its microscopic derivation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the definitions of the Kimber-Martin-Ryskin-Watt (KMRW) unintegrated parton densities (UPDFs) have been discussed by several groups. In the first part of this manuscript, we remind the issues encountered with these definitions and discuss the proposed solutions. In our opinion, none of these solutions is fully satisfactory. We observe that these issues seem to be related to the normalization condition where the UPDFs are related to the collinear PDFs by an integration over transverse momentum cut off by the factorization scale. Then, we build a modified version of the angular-ordering KMRW UPDFs, obeying the normalization condition with the transverse momentum integrated up to infinity and show that the usual issues are absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-loop contributions to the flavor-changing neutral current decays of the top quark into a light quark and a gauge boson or Higgs boson, namely $t\rightarrow qV,qh$, with $q$ being $u$ or $c$, and $V$ being $\gamma$, $g$, or $Z$, are analyzed in this study within the framework of the minimal R-symmetric supersymmetric standard model. The charginos in this model have been separated into two sets, i.e., $\chi$-chargino and $\rho$-chargino. The numerical results reveal that gluino or $\rho$-chargino predominantly dictate the predictions for BR($t\rightarrow qV,qh$), while the impact of neutralino or $\chi$-chargino contributions is insignificant. By incorporating the constraints imposed by the squark mixing parameters from $\bar{B}\rightarrow X_s\gamma$ and $B^0_{d,s}\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$, the theoretical predictions for BR($t\rightarrow qg$) can be significantly augmented to approximately $\mathcal O(10^{-5}-10^{-6})$. On the other hand, the values of BR($t\rightarrow q\gamma,qZ,qh$) are predicted to be at least four orders of magnitude below the current experimental limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) that decay into photon pairs pose a challenge for experiments that rely on the construction of a decay vertex in order to search for long-lived particles. This is particularly true for beam-dump experiments, where the distance between the unknown decay position and the calorimeter can be very large. In this work we use machine learning to explore the possibility to reconstruct the ALP properties, in particular its mass and lifetime, from such inaccurate observations. We use a simulation-based inference approach based on conditional invertible neural networks to reconstruct the posterior probability of the ALP parameters for a given set of events. We find that for realistic angular and energy resolution, such a neural network significantly outperforms parameter reconstruction from conventional high-level variables while at the same time providing reliable uncertainty estimates. Moreover, the neural network can quickly be re-trained for different detector properties, making it an ideal framework for optimizing experimental design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions are arguably the most compelling dark matter (DM) candidates in the literature. Here, we consider a model where the PQ symmetry solves the strong CP problem, generates radiatively Dirac neutrino masses, and gives origin to multicomponent dark sector. Specifically, scotogenic Dirac neutrino masses arise at one-loop level. The lightest fermionic mediator acts as the second DM candidate due to a residual $Z_2$ symmetry resulting from the PQ symmetry breaking. The WIMP DM component resembles the well-known singlet-doublet fermion DM. While the lower WIMP dark mass region is usually excluded, our model reopens that portion of the parameter space (for DM masses below $\lesssim 100$ GeV). Therefore, we perform a phenomenological analysis that addresses the constraints from direct searches of DM, neutrino oscillation data, and charged lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes. The model can be tested in future facilities where DM annihilation into SM particles is searched for by neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Searches of Vector-like Lepton and Its Accompanying Scalar at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the vector-like leptons (VLLs) as a simple extension to the standard model (SM) have attracted widespread attention both in theory and experiments. The present collider searches mainly focus on the studies of their prompt decays, which prefer a relatively large coupling. In this paper, we concentrate on searches for long-lived signatures of the singlet VLLs $F$ or their accompanying scalar particles $\phi$ both in the hadronic and electronic colliders. The long-lived signatures are naturally induced from small chiral mass mixing between VLLs and SM leptons. Two specific models distinguished by whether the VLLs couple to scalar particles are introduced to realize the aforementioned features. For long-lived VLLs case, we find that with the kink track method the sensitivities at future HL-LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14~\text{TeV}$ can reach the regions for VLL mass $m_F \in [200,1100]~\text{GeV}$ and the mass mixing parameter $\theta_L \in [10^{-10},3\times 10^{-8}]$. For the long-lived accompanying scalar particle case, by fixing VLLs or scalar mass, or the mass ratio between VLL and the accompanying scalar, we explore the projected sensitivities through the time delay and displaced vertex strategies, which can probe the regions for $m_F \in [200,1200]~\text{GeV}$ and coupling $y\theta_L\in [10^{-11},10^{-6}]$. Furthermore, we also explore the long-lived accompanying scalars at the future CEPC provided that the VLLs can couple to the SM first-generation leptons. We find that CEPC has good performances for $m_\phi &lt; 120~\text{GeV}$ and $m_F&lt;1200~\text{GeV}$. These long-lived searches are complementary to previous studies, which opens the door towards the smaller coupling regions.</description>

      <title>Jet Classification Using High-Level Features from Anatomy of Top Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models have significantly enhanced jet classification performance by analyzing low-level features (LLFs). However, this approach often leads to less interpretable models, emphasizing the need to understand the decision-making process and to identify the high-level features (HLFs) crucial for explaining jet classification. To address this, we consider the top jet tagging problems and introduce an analysis model (AM) that analyzes selected HLFs designed to capture important features of top jets. Our AM mainly consists of the following three modules: a relation network analyzing two-point energy correlations, mathematical morphology and Minkowski functionals for generalizing jet constituent multiplicities, and a recursive neural network analyzing subjet constituent multiplicity to enhance sensitivity to subjet color charges. We demonstrate that our AM achieves performance comparable to the Particle Transformer (ParT) while requiring fewer computational resources in a comparison of top jet tagging using jets simulated at the hadronic calorimeter angular resolution scale. Furthermore, as a more constrained architecture than ParT, the AM exhibits smaller training uncertainties because of the bias-variance tradeoff. We also compare the information content of AM and ParT by decorrelating the features already learned by AM. Lastly, we briefly comment on the results of AM with finer angular resolution inputs.</description>

      <title>Masses and Magnetic Moments of Singly Heavy Pentaquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of single heavy tetraquark structures, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^a (2900)^{++}$ and $T_{c\bar{s}0}^a(2900)^0$ by the LHCb collaboration, masses and magnetic moments of singly heavy pentaquark states are estimated in this work. To classify the singly heavy pentaquark structures, we employ the special unitary representation. By using the SU(3) flavor representation, we placed singly heavy pentaquark states into the allowed flavor multiples. Also, by using the extension of the Gursey-Radicati mass formula and the effective mass scheme, we estimated the masses of singly heavy pentaquark states. Further, magnetic moments of these states have been calculated using the effective mass and the screened charge techniques. A thorough comparison of our results shows reasonable agreement with the available theoretical data and may be helpful for future experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Gluons in QCD: Re-interpretation of ALEPH and CMS Gluon Jet Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abelian decomposition of QCD tells that there are two types of gluons in QCD, the color neutral neurons and colored chromons, which behave differently. This strongly implies that QCD has two types of gluon jets, the neuron jet and chromon jet. One quarter of the gluon jets is made of the neuron jets which have sharper jet radius and smaller particle multiplicity, while three quarters of them are made of chromon jets which have the broader jet radius and larger particle multiplicity. Moreover, the neuron jet has a distinct color flow which forms an ideal color dipole pattern, while the chromon jets have distorted dipole pattern. In this paper we provide five circumferential evidences of the existence of two types of gluon jets from the existing ALEPH and DELPHI data on $e \bar e \rightarrow Z \rightarrow b \bar b g$ decay and the CMS data on Pb-Pb heavy ion collision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of example models in which the Standard Model (SM) symmetry group is extended by a new abelian symmetry. This additional symmetry appears anomalous in the effective low-energy theory; however, the anomalies cancel out when massive chiral fermions not present in the effective low-energy theory are taken into account. These chiral fermions under the new abelian gauge group, are chosen to be vector-like under the SM symmetries, and reside in the same representations as quarks and leptons. This allows us to quantitatively determine the magnitude of tree-level interactions between three vector bosons induced in low-energy effective field theory by the integration of chiral heavy fermions. We also examine the perturbativity constraints of the theory and the ultraviolet cut-off. We conclude by highlighting possible extensions of our work.</description>

      <title>Identifying an $\rm X(3872)$ tetraquark state versus a molecular state by formation time, velocity and temperature in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of exotic hadron $\rm X(3872)$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76\,\mathrm{TeV}$ is investigated by the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE in this work. In the simulation the final partonic state (quark matter, QM) and the final hadronic state (hadron matter, HM) are continuously processed and recorded. The $\rm X(3872)$ compact tetraquark state and loose molecular state are, respectively, coalesced and recombined in the QM and HM with the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence model. The formation time, velocity and temperature of QM (tetraquark state) and HM (molecular state) are proposed as identifying criteria between the two states. Our results in transverse momentum spectrum and rapidity distribution, etc. show a significant discrepancy between the two states and confirm that they are also valuable criteria identifying the $\rm X(3872)$ compact tetraquark state or molecular state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mass spectra and spin alignment of vector meson $J/\psi$ in a thermal magnetized background using a generalized theoretical framework based on gauge/gravity duality. Utilizing a soft wall model for the QGP background and a massive vector field for the $J/\psi$ meson, we delve into the meson's spectral function and spin parameters $(\lambda_{\theta},\, \lambda_\varphi,\,\lambda_{\theta\varphi})$ for different cases, assessing their response to variations in magnetic field strength, momentum, and temperature. We initially examine scenarios where a meson's momentum aligns parallel to the magnetic field in helicity frame. Our results reveal a magnetic field-induced positive $\lambda_\theta^\text{H}$ for low meson momentum, transitioning to negative with increased momentum. As a comparison, we also study the case of momentum perpendicular to the magnetic field and find the direction of magnetic field does not affect the qualitative behavior for the $eB$-dependence of $\lambda_\theta^\text{H}$. Moreover, we apply our model to real heavy-ion collisions for three different spin quantization directions. Further comparisons with experimental data show qualitative agreement for spin parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$ and $\lambda_\varphi$ in the helicity and Collins-Soper frames.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Sourced by Decay of Massive Particle from Primordial Black Hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) spectrum, resulting from the emission of gravitons through bremsstrahlung, in the decay of particles produced by Hawking radiation. Although particle decays inevitably entail the emission of graviton due to bremsstrahlung, the associated decay width is notably suppressed due to the Planck scale suppression in the coupling of matter fields to gravitons. Consequently, the relic abundance of such GWs constituted of these gravitons undergoes a corresponding reduction. However, we demonstrate that super-heavy particles, reaching masses as high as Planck scale, can emerge naturally in the Hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) and can compensate for this suppression. In addition, we also discuss the stochastic gravitational waves constituted out of the gravitons directly radiated from such evaporating PBHs. When the super-heavy particle decays promptly after its production, then the corresponding GW spectrum remains subdominant to the one arising from direct PBH evaporation. However, if this particle is long-lived and decays after PBH evaporation, then the resulting GWs produced in these two processes have two distinct spectra with their peaks at extremely high frequencies, providing avenues for proposed ultra-high frequency gravitational wave detectors. We also show that such gravitational waves contribute significantly to substantial dark radiation, which can be probed with the enhanced sensitivity of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Order of the SU(N_f) x SU(N_f) chiral transition via the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Quark flavor violation and axion-like particles from top-quark decays at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study axion-like particles (ALPs) with quark-flavor-violating couplings at the LHC. Specifically, we focus on the theoretical scenario with ALP-top-up and ALP-top-charm interactions, in addition to the more common quark-flavor-diagonal couplings. The ALPs can thus originate from decays of top quarks which are pair produced in large numbers at the LHC, and then decay to jets. If these couplings to the quarks are tiny and the ALPs have $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV masses, they are long-lived, leading to signatures of displaced vertex plus multiple jets, which have the advantage of suppression of background events at the LHC. We recast a recent ATLAS search for the same signature and reinterpret the results in terms of bounds on the long-lived ALP in our theoretical scenario. We find that the LHC with the full Run 2 dataset can place stringent limits, while at the future high-luminosity LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity stronger sensitivities are expected.</description>

Abstract: Semi-inclusive hadron production in longitudinally polarized deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering is a powerful tool for resolving the quark flavor decomposition of the proton's spin structure. We present the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the coefficient functions of polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in analytical form, enabling the use of SIDIS measurements in precision studies of the proton spin structure. The numerical impact of these corrections is illustrated by a comparison with data of polarized single-inclusive hadron spectra from the DESY HERMES and CERN COMPASS experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a novel reheating scenario proceeding through $s$-channel inflaton annihilation, mediated by a massive scalar. If the inflaton $\phi$ oscillates around the minimum of a monomial potential $\propto \phi^{n}$, we reveal the emergence of resonance phenomena originating from the dynamic evolution of the inflaton mass for $n&gt;2$. Consequently, a resonance appears in both the radiation and the temperature evolution during the reheating process. By solving the coupled Boltzmann equations, we present solutions for radiation and temperature. We find non-trivial temperature characteristics during reheating, depending on the value of $n$ and the masses of the inflaton and mediator. Some phenomenological aspects of the model are explored. As a concrete example, we show that the same mediator participates in the genesis of dark matter, modifying the standard freeze-in dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate that the resonant reheating scenario could be tested by next-generation low- and high-frequency gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>

Abstract: With the continuous accumulation of data from hadron collision experiments, efficient Partial Wave Analysis tools are indispensable for constructing a clear hadron spectrum. Currently, automated computations of scattering amplitudes primarily use the helicity scheme and covariant effective Lagrangian method. The automated calculations under the covariant $L$-$S$ scheme, which is one of the commonly used partial wave analysis schemes, have not been fully realized. In this work, we provide a general algorithm for computing partial wave amplitudes under the covariant $L$-$S$ scheme. This will lay the foundation for automated computation of partial wave amplitudes under the covariant $L$-$S$ scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically explore their electromagnetic characteristics to improve our understanding of the quark-gluon dynamics underlying the complex and controversial nature of multiquark systems. In this study, the magnetic dipole moments of $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks are extracted, which are directly related to the inner organization of the relevant states. The magnetic dipole moments of these states have been evaluated employing the QCD light-cone sum rules technique with isospin spin-parity $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$ and $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$, for $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks respectively. Our predictions for the magnetic dipole moment $\mu_{D\Sigma_c} = 2.98^{+0.76}_{-0.54}~\mu_N$ for the $ D \Sigma_c$ pentaquark, $\mu_{D\Sigma_c^*} = 1.65^{+0.45}_{-0.34}~\mu_N$ for the $D\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark, and $\mu_{D^*\Sigma_c} = -3.63^{+0.79}_{-0.60}~\mu_N$ for the $D^*\Sigma_c$ pentaquark. Furthermore, we have also extracted the electric quadrupole and the magnetic octupole moments of the $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks. These values show a non-spherical charge distribution. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic dipole moments of the doubly-charmed pentaquarks, in conjunction with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these intriguing pentaquarks, will prove valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in elucidating the internal structure of these pentaquarks.</description>

Abstract: A randomly generated complex symmetric matrix using Adaptive Monte Carlo method, is taken as a general form of Majorana neutrino mass matrix, which is diagonalized by the use of eigenvectors. We extract all the neutrino oscillation parameters i.e. two mass-squared differences ($\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$ ), three mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and three phases i.e. one Dirac CP violating phase ($\delta_{CP}$) and two Majorana phases ($\alpha$ and $\beta$). The charge-parity (CP) violating phases are extracted from the mixing matrix constructed with the eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix formed by the complex symmetric matrix. All the neutrino oscillation parameters within 3$\sigma$ bound are allowed in both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) consistent with the latest Planck cosmological upper bound, $\sum\vert m_i\vert&lt;0.12$ eV. This latest cosmological upper bound is allowed only in three cases of zero texture for $m_{11}=0$; $m_{11},m_{12}=0$ and $m_{11},m_{13}=0$ in normal hierarchy whereas none of zero texture is allowed in inverted hierarchy. We also study effective neutrino masses $m_{\beta}$ in tritium beta decay and $m_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Hilltop Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve successful hilltop inflation in which the inflaton is identified as the modulus field in a modular invariant theory. The dilaton plays a crucial role in shaping the potential. Modular invariant gaugino condensation provides the mechanism for the modulus stabilisation after inflation. The inflationary trajectory lies on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain of the modulus field $\tau$. Inflation starts near the fixed point $\tau ={\rm i}$, and ends at a point near $\tau = \omega$, which is the global de Sitter vacuum. We investigate the allowed parameter space for successful modular invariant hilltop inflation.</description>

      <title>Theoretical bounds on dark Higgs mass in a self-interacting dark matter model with $U(1)'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the null results of current dark matter searches and the small-scale problems, we study a dark sector charged by a spontaneous broken gauge $U(1)'$. To explore the parameter space of this model, in addition to the consideration of the small-scale data, we also consider the theoretical bounds on the dark Higgs mass, with the upper bound coming from the tree-level perturbative unitarity and the lower bound from the one-loop Linde-Weinberg bound. We deeply examine the dependence of the Linde-Weinberg bound on gauge choice and energy scale, and present a Linde-Weinberg bound that is gauge and scale independent. Combining the theoretical and observational constraints, we obtain the following ranges for the parameter space: the dark matter mass is 10-500 GeV, the mediator (dark photon) mass is 0.5-5 MeV, the dark Higgs mass is 0.05-50 MeV, and the dark fine-structure constant is 0.001-0.4. We conclude that the dark Higgs in this model cannot be ignored in the phenomenological study of the dark sector.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the construction of {\mu^+}{e^-} and {\mu^+}{\mu^+} colliders, {\mu}TRISTAN, at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar {\mu^+} ring tangential to LHC/Tevatron/FCC/SppC will give an opportunity to realize {\mu^+}p and {\mu^+}A collisions at multi-TeV scale center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration: L exceeds {10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}p colliders and {10^{30} cm^{-2}s^{-1}} for {\mu^+}A colliders. Certainly, proposed colliders will provide huge potential for both SM (especially QCD basics) and BSM physics searches.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis via QCD preheating with nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral phase transition in QCD can be supercooled in the thermal history of the universe to be instantaneously out-of equilibrium, if QCD is coupled to a dark QCD sector exhibiting the dark chiral phase transition of the first order. In that case the QCD sigma meson field (as the chiral order parameter, or the light quark condensate) starts to roll in a nonadiabatic way down to the true QCD vacuum. Meanwhile a dynamic baryonic chemical potential can be generated solely within QCD, which is governed by the dynamic motion of the QCD sigma meson field, analogously to the spontaneous baryogenesis or the leptogenesis via the Higgs or axionlike relaxation scenario. When QCD is further allowed to communicate with a dark fermion with mass of order of 1 GeV and the baryon number violating coupling to neutron, the nonadiabatic QCD sigma motion along with the nonadiabatic baryon chemical potential can trigger the preheating and produce the baryon number asymmetry. We discuss this scenario in details to find that the QCD-induced dynamic baryon chemical potential plays a significant role for the QCD preheating and the baryogenesis, which yields the desired amount of the asymmetry today consistently with current astrophysical, cosmological, and terrestrial experimental constraints. Cosmological and phenomenological consequences characteristic to the present scenario are also addressed.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$- and $\rho$-trajectories for the hidden bottom/charm tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the heavy tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$ $(Q=b,\,c;\,q,\,q'=u,\,d,\,s)$ with hidden bottom and charm. By employing the new relations, both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories for the tetraquarks $(Qq)(\bar{Q}\bar{q}')$ can be discussed. The masses of the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states are estimated, and they agree with other theoretical predictions. We show that the behaviors of the $\rho$-trajectories are different from those of the $\lambda$-trajectories. The $\rho$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\rho}^{1/2}$ $(x_{\rho}=n_r,\,l)$ while the $\lambda$-trajectories behave as $M{\sim}x_{\lambda}^{2/3}$ $(x_{\lambda}=N_r,\,L)$. Moreover, the Regge trajectory behaviors for other types of tetraquarks are investigated based on the spinless Salpeter equation. We show that both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the tetraquarks containing the light diquark and/or the light antidiquark also are concave in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane when the masses of the light constituents are included and the confining potential is linear.</description>

Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that this ambiguity can be solved in interacting field theories. We prove that the mean field limit of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions is equivalent to non-dissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor.</description>

      <title>Net-proton fluctuations influenced by baryon stopping and quark deconfinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preliminary data from the Beam-Energy Scan II measurements by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider suggest a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when plotted vs. beam energy. At the same energy range where the structure appears, a transition from hadrons to quarks is expected, the deconfinement transition. In this paper, the role of quark deconfinement in establishing fluctuaitions in the early stages of the collision is considered. Two models are compared: one with stopping occurring on a baryon-by-baryon basis, and a second where stopping proceeds through quark degrees of freedom. In the latter model, the fluctuation of baryon number is significantly reduced and this signal is found to survive recombination into hadrons and the subsequent diffusion. The transformation from baryon to quark stopping thus produces a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when plotted vs. beam energy, consistent with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With excellent energy resolution and ultra-low level radiogenic backgrounds, the high-purity germanium detectors in the Majorana Demonstrator enable searches for several classes of exotic dark matter (DM) models. In this work, we report new experimental limits on keV-scale sterile neutrino DM via the transition magnetic moment from conversion to active neutrinos, $\nu_s \rightarrow \nu_a$. We report new limits on fermionic dark matter absorption ($\chi + A \rightarrow \nu + A$) and sub-GeV DM-nucleus 3$\rightarrow$2 scattering ($\chi + \chi + A \rightarrow \phi + A$), and new exclusion limits for bosonic dark matter (axionlike particles and dark photons). These searches utilize the (1--100)-keV low energy region of a 37.5-kg y exposure collected by the Demonstrator between May 2016 and November 2019, using a set of $^{76}$Ge-enriched detectors whose surface exposure time was carefully controlled, resulting in extremely low levels of cosmogenic activation.</description>

      <title>Evading no-go for PBH formation and production of SIGWs using Multiple Sharp Transitions in EFT of single field inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying \textit{multiple sharp transitions} (MSTs) under a unified framework, we investigate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and the production of Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) by incorporating one-loop corrected renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum. With effective sound speed parameter, $1 \leq c_s \leq 1.17$, the direct consequence is the generation of PBH masses spanning $M_{\rm PBH}\sim{\cal O}(10^{-31}M_{\odot}- 10^{4}M_{\odot})$, thus evading well known \textit{No-go theorem} on PBH mass. Our results align coherently with the extensive NANOGrav 15-year data and the sensitivities outlined by other terrestrial and space-based experiments (e.g.: LISA, HLVK, BBO, HLV(O3), etc.).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an effort to understand nuclei in terms of quarks we develop an effective theory to low-energy quantum chromodynamics in which a single quark contained in a nucleus is driven by a mean field due to other constituents of the nucleus. We analyze the reason why the number of $d$ quarks in light stable nuclei is much the same as that of $u$ quarks, while for heavier nuclei beginning with ${\rm Ca}^{40}$, the number of $d$ quarks is greater than the number of $u$ quarks. To account for the finiteness of the periodic table, we invoke a version of gauge/gravity duality between the dynamical affair in stable nuclei and that in extremal black holes. With the assumption that the end of stability for heavy nuclei is dual to the occurrence of a naked singularity, we find that the maximal number of protons in stable nuclei is $Z_{\max}^{\rm H}\approx 82$.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity as a saviour for PBH overproduction in SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays for Galileon inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the explicit role of negative local non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, in suppressing the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the single-field model of Galileon inflation. PBH formation requires significantly enhancing the scalar power spectrum, which greatly affects their abundance. The associated frequencies in the nHz regime are also sensitive to the generation of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) which may explain the current data from the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Our analysis using the threshold statistics on the compaction function demonstrates that Galileon theory not only avoids PBH overproduction using the curvature perturbation enhancements that give $f_{\rm NL} \sim {\cal O}(-6)$, but also generates SIGWs that conform well with the PTA data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of heavy stars ($M\ge40{\rm M}_\odot$) undergoing pair-instability in the presence of annihilating dark matter. Focusing on the scenario where the dark matter is in capture-annihilation equilibrium, we model the profile of energy injections in the local thermal equilibrium approximation. We find that significant changes to masses of astrophysical black holes formed by (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae can occur when the ambient dark matter density $ \rho_{\rm DM} \gtrsim10^9 \rm \, GeV \, cm^{-3}$. There are two distinct outcomes, depending on the dark matter mass. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\gtrsim1$ GeV the DM is primarily confined to the core. The annihilation increases the lifetime of core helium burning, resulting in more oxygen being formed, fueling a more violent explosion during the pair-instability-induced contraction. This drives stronger pulsations, leading to lighter black holes being formed than predicted by the standard model. For masses $m_{\rm DM}\lesssim0.5$ GeV there is significant dark matter in the envelope, leading to a phase where the star is supported by the energy from the annihilation. This reduces the core temperature and density, allowing the star to evade the pair-instability allowing heavier black holes to be formed. We find a mass gap for all models studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a novel study to obtain the initial spin of the primordial black holes created during a first-order phase transition due to delayed false vacuum decay. Remaining within the parameter space consistent with observational bounds, we express the abundance and the initial spin of the primordial black holes as functions of the phase transition parameters. The abundance of the primordial black holes is extremely sensitive to the phase transition parameters. We also find that the initial spin weakly depends on all parameters except the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Mass and wind luminosity of young Galactic open clusters in Gaia DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Star clusters constitute a significant part of the stellar population in our Galaxy. The feedback processes they exert on the interstellar medium impact multiple physical processes from the chemical to the dynamical evolution of the Galaxy. In addition, young and massive stellar clusters might act as efficient particle accelerators and contribute to the production of cosmic rays. Aims. We aim at evaluating the wind luminosity driven by the young (&lt; 30 Myr) Galactic open stellar clusters observed by the Gaia space mission. This is crucial for determining the energy channeled into accelerated particles. Methods. To do this, we developed a method relying on the number, magnitude, and line-of-sight extinction of the stars observed per cluster. Assuming that the stellar mass function follows a Kroupa mass distribution and accounting for the maximum stellar mass allowed by the age and mass of the parent cluster, we conservatively estimated the mass and wind luminosity of 387 local clusters within the second data release of Gaia. Results. We compared the results of our computation with recent estimates of young cluster masses. With respect to these, our sample is three times more abundant, particularly above a few thousand solar masses. This is of the utmost relevance for predicting the gamma-ray emission resulting from the interaction of accelerated particles. The cluster wind luminosity distribution we obtained extends up to 3x10^38 erg/s. This is a promising feature in terms of potential particle acceleration scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological distances are fundamental observables in cosmology. The luminosity ($D_L$), angular diameter ($D_A$) and gravitational wave ($D_{\rm GW}$) distances are all trivially related in General Relativity assuming no significant absorption of photons in the extragalactic medium, also known as cosmic opacity. Supernovae have long been the main cosmological standard candle, but bright standard sirens are now a proven alternative, with the advantage of not requiring calibration with other astrophysical sources. Moreover, they can also measure deviations from modified gravity through discrepancies between $D_L$ and $D_{\rm GW}$. However, both gravitational and cosmological parameters are degenerate in the Hubble diagram, making it hard to properly detect beyond standard model physics. Finally, recently a model-independent method named FreePower was proposed to infer angular diameter distances from large-scale structure which is independent of the knowledge of both early universe and dark energy physics. In this paper we propose a tripartite test of the ratios of these three distances with minimal amount of assumptions regarding cosmology, the early universe, cosmic opacity and modified gravity. We proceed to forecast this test with a combination of LSST and Roman supernovae, Einstein Telescope bright sirens and a joint DESI-like + Euclid-like galaxy survey. We find that even in this very model-independent approach we will be able to detect, in each of many redshift bins, percent-level deviations in these ratios of distances, allowing for very precise consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and standard physics. It can also result in sub-percent measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Nearest neighbour analysis as a new probe for fuzzy dark matter</title>

Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is a promising candidate for dark matter, characterized by its ultra-light mass, which gives rise to wave effects at astrophysical scales. These effects offer potential solutions to the small-scale issues encountered within the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this paper, we investigate the large-scale structure of the cosmic web using FDM simulations, comparing them to CDM-only simulations and a simulation incorporating baryonic effects. Our study employs the nearest neighbor (NN) analysis as a new statistical tool for examining the structure and statistics of the cosmic web in an FDM universe. This analysis could capture the information absent in the two-point correlation functions. In particular, we analyze data related to the spherical contact, nearest neighbor distances, and the angle between the first and second nearest neighbors of halos. Specifically, we utilize probability distribution functions, statistical moments, and fitting parameters, as well as G(x), F(x), and J(x) functions to analyze the above data. Remarkably, the results from the FDM simulations differ significantly from the others across these analyses, while no noticeable distinction is observed between the baryonic and CDM-only simulations. Moreover, the lower FDM mass leads to more significant deviations from the CDM simulations. These compelling results highlight the efficiency of the NN analysis - mainly through the use of the J(x) function, $s_3$, $l_{3}$ and $a_4$ parameters - as a prominent new tool for investigating FDM on large scales and making observational predictions.</description>

      <title>The stochastic relativistic advection diffusion equation from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an approach to simulating the stochastic relativistic advection-diffusion equation based on the Metropolis algorithm. We show that the dissipative dynamics of the boosted fluctuating fluid can be simulated by making random transfers of charge between fluid cells, interspersed with ideal hydrodynamic time steps. The random charge transfers are accepted or rejected in a Metropolis step using the entropy as a statistical weight. This procedure reproduces the expected strains of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics in a specific (and non-covariant) hydrodynamic frame known as the density frame. Numerical results, both with and without noise, are presented and compared to relativistic kinetics and analytical expectations. An all order resummation of the density frame gradient expansion reproduces the covariant dynamics in a specific model. In contrast to all other numerical approaches to relativistic dissipative fluids, the dissipative fluid formalism presented here is strictly first order in gradients and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. The physical naturalness and simplicity of the Metropolis algorithm, together with its convergence properties, make it a promising tool for simulating stochastic relativistic fluids in heavy ion collisions and for critical phenomena in the relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Deriving Ontological Statements from the Unnatural Higgs Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide novel, metatheoretical arguments strengthening the position that the naturalness problem of the light Higgs mass is a pseudo-problem: No physics beyond the standard model of particle physics is needed to explain the small value of the Higgs boson. By evaluating previous successes of the guiding principle of technical naturalness, we restrict its applicability to non-fundamental phenomena in the realm of provisional theories within limited energy scales. In view of further breaches of autonomy of scales in apparently fundamental phenomena outside particle physics, the hierarchy problem of the Higgs mass is instead reinterpreted as an indication of the ontologically fundamental status of the Higgs boson. Applying the concept of Selective Realism justifies this seemingly contradictory attribution within the effective theories of the standard model of particle physics. Moreover, we argue that the ongoing naturalness debate about the Higgs mass is partly based on the adherence to the methodology of effective theories (often claimed to be universally applicable), for which there is no justification when dealing with presumably fundamental phenomena such as the Higgs mechanism, even if it is embedded into an effective theory.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon cross sections are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated. The absence of $\Delta$ broadening is slightly favored, but the larger uncertainties on the pion production data prevent definitive conclusions.</description>

      <title>A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs (Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds. An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of $\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Driven Inspirals of Binaries Connected by Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitational waves from a pair of monopoles or black holes that are moving non-relativistically and are connected by a cosmic string. Shortly after the binary's formation, the connecting string straightens due the direct coupling of its motion to gravitational radiation. Afterwards, the motion of the binary can be well-approximated by a non-relativistic motion of its components that have an additional constant mutual attraction force due to the tension of the straight string that connects them. The orbit shrinks due to the gravitational radiation backreacting on the binary's components. We find that if the binary's semimajor axis $a\gg \sqrt{R_1 R_2/{\mu}}$, its eccentricity grows on the inspiral's timescale; here $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the gravitational radii of the binary components, and $\mu$ is the dimensionless tension of the string. When the eccentricity is high, it approaches unity super-exponentially. If the binary's components are monopole-antimonopole pair, this leads to the physical collision that would likely destroy the string and annihilate the monopoles when the semimajor axis is still many orders of magnitude greater than the string thickness. If the binary's components are black holes, then the eccentricity reaches its peak when $a\sim \sqrt{R_1 R_2/\mu}$, and then decays according to the standard Peter's formula. The black-hole spins initially become locked to the orbital motion, but then lag behind as the inspiral proceeds. We estimate the string-tension-induced dimensionless spins just prior to the merger and find them to be $\sim\mu^{3/8}\ll 1$.</description>

Abstract: We search for excited charmed baryons in the $\Lambda_c^+\eta$ system using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 980 $\rm fb^{-1}$. The data were collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^{+}$$e^{-}$ asymmetric-energy collider. No significant signals are found in the $\Lambda_c^+\eta$ mass spectrum, including the known $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$. Clear $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ signals are observed in the $pD^0$ mass spectrum. We set upper limits at 90\% credibility level on ratios of branching fractions of $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ decaying to $\Lambda_c^+\eta$ relative to $\Sigma_c(2455)\pi$ of $&lt;0.13$ for the $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $&lt;1.11$ for the $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$. We measure ratios of branching fractions of $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ decaying to $pD^0$ relative to $\Sigma_c(2455)\pi$ of $0.75 \pm 0.03(\text{stat.}) \pm 0.07(\text{syst.})$ for the $\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $3.59 \pm 0.21(\text{stat.}) \pm 0.56(\text{syst.})$ for the $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are important quantities in describing nucleon structures. They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of nucleonic Fock states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. It is naturally to obtain the slope of the EMC effect $dR_{EMC}/dx$ as long as the factor is independent of momentum fraction $x$. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\sin^2\theta_W$ by using dPDFs.</description>

      <title>Probing coalescence of light nuclei via femtoscopy and azimuthal anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The production mechanism of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions is vital to understanding the intricate details of nucleon-nucleon interactions. The coalescence of nucleons is a well-known mechanism that attempts to explain the production mechanism of these light clusters. This work investigates the formation mechanism of these nucleon clusters with a combination of coalescence and femtoscopy of nucleons and nuclei. It is achieved by appending a coalescence and correlation afterburner (\texttt{CRAB}) to the \texttt{SMASH} transport model. To have a proper view of the anisotropy of light nuclei clusters, a mean-field approach to \texttt{SMASH} is applied. The anisotropic coefficients of various light nuclei clusters are calculated and compared to experimental measurements. To incorporate hydrodynamics into the picture, the anisotropic measurements are completed in a hybrid \texttt{SMASH}+\texttt{vHLLE} mode. In both approaches, the femtoscopy of nucleons and light nuclei is performed, reported with CRAB, and compared to the latest experimental measurements. An insight into cluster formation time is drawn by extracting the emission source size with the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits (LL) model.</description>
