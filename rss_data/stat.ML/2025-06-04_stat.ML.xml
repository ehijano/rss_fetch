      <title>Enabling Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds through Double Diffusion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generative learning framework for probabilistic sampling based on an extension of the Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds (PLoM) approach, which is designed to generate statistically consistent realizations of a random vector in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, informed by a limited (yet representative) set of observations. In its original form, PLoM constructs a reduced-order probabilistic model by combining three main components: (a) kernel density estimation to approximate the underlying probability measure, (b) Diffusion Maps to uncover the intrinsic low-dimensional manifold structure, and (c) a reduced-order Ito Stochastic Differential Equation (ISDE) to sample from the learned distribution. A key challenge arises, however, when the number of available data points N is small and the dimensionality of the diffusion-map basis approaches N, resulting in overfitting and loss of generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enabling extension that implements a synthesis of Double Diffusion Maps -- a technique capable of capturing multiscale geometric features of the data -- with Geometric Harmonics (GH), a nonparametric reconstruction method that allows smooth nonlinear interpolation in high-dimensional ambient spaces. This approach enables us to solve a full-order ISDE directly in the latent space, preserving the full dynamical complexity of the system, while leveraging its reduced geometric representation. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are illustrated through two numerical studies: one based on data generated from two-dimensional Hermite polynomial functions and another based on high-fidelity simulations of a detonation wave in a reactive flow.</description>

      <title>Assumption-free stability for ranking problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider ranking problems among a finite set of candidates: for instance, selecting the top-$k$ items among a larger list of candidates or obtaining the full ranking of all items in the set. These problems are often unstable, in the sense that estimating a ranking from noisy data can exhibit high sensitivity to small perturbations. Concretely, if we use data to provide a score for each item (say, by aggregating preference data over a sample of users), then for two items with similar scores, small fluctuations in the data can alter the relative ranking of those items. Many existing theoretical results for ranking problems assume a separation condition to avoid this challenge, but real-world data often contains items whose scores are approximately tied, limiting the applicability of existing theory. To address this gap, we develop a new algorithmic stability framework for ranking problems, and propose two novel ranking operators for achieving stable ranking: the \emph{inflated top-$k$} for the top-$k$ selection problem and the \emph{inflated full ranking} for ranking the full list. To enable stability, each method allows for expressing some uncertainty in the output. For both of these two problems, our proposed methods provide guaranteed stability, with no assumptions on data distributions and no dependence on the total number of candidates to be ranked. Experiments on real-world data confirm that the proposed methods offer stability without compromising the informativeness of the output.</description>

      <title>MoCA: Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder for Digital Health Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of digital health technologies has led to the generation of complex multi-modal data, such as physical activity measurements simultaneously collected from various sensors of mobile and wearable devices. These data hold immense potential for advancing health studies, but current methods predominantly rely on supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled datasets that are often expensive or impractical to obtain, especially in clinical studies. To address this limitation, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called Multi-modal Cross-masked Autoencoder (MoCA) that leverages cross-modality masking and the Transformer autoencoder architecture to utilize both temporal correlations within modalities and cross-modal correlations between data streams. We also provide theoretical guarantees to support the effectiveness of the cross-modality masking scheme in MoCA. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both reconstruction and downstream tasks. We release open-source code for data processing, pre-training, and downstream tasks in the supplementary materials. This work highlights the transformative potential of self-supervised learning in digital health and multi-modal data.</description>

      <title>Large Stepsizes Accelerate Gradient Descent for Regularized Logistic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gradient descent (GD) with a constant stepsize for $\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression with linearly separable data. Classical theory suggests small stepsizes to ensure monotonic reduction of the optimization objective, achieving exponential convergence in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\kappa)$ steps with $\kappa$ being the condition number. Surprisingly, we show that this can be accelerated to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\kappa})$ by simply using a large stepsize -- for which the objective evolves nonmonotonically. The acceleration brought by large stepsizes extends to minimizing the population risk for separable distributions, improving on the best-known upper bounds on the number of steps to reach a near-optimum. Finally, we characterize the largest stepsize for the local convergence of GD, which also determines the global convergence in special scenarios. Our results extend the analysis of Wu et al. (2024) from convex settings with minimizers at infinity to strongly convex cases with finite minimizers.</description>

      <title>Tensor State Space-based Dynamic Multilayer Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions within dynamic multilayer networks is critical for advancements in various scientific domains. Existing models often fail to capture such networks' temporal and cross-layer dynamics. This paper introduces a novel Tensor State Space Model for Dynamic Multilayer Networks (TSSDMN), utilizing a latent space model framework. TSSDMN employs a symmetric Tucker decomposition to represent latent node features, their interaction patterns, and layer transitions. Then by fixing the latent features and allowing the interaction patterns to evolve over time, TSSDMN uniquely captures both the temporal dynamics within layers and across different layers. The model identifiability conditions are discussed. By treating latent features as variables whose posterior distributions are approximated using a mean-field variational inference approach, a variational Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for efficient model inference. Numerical simulations and case studies demonstrate the efficacy of TSSDMN for understanding dynamic multilayer networks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of SGD in Sequence-Single Index Models and Single-Layer Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for a class of sequence models termed Sequence Single-Index (SSI) models, where the target depends on a single direction in input space applied to a sequence of tokens. This setting generalizes classical single-index models to the sequential domain, encompassing simplified one-layer attention architectures. We derive a closed-form expression for the population loss in terms of a pair of sufficient statistics capturing semantic and positional alignment, and characterize the induced high-dimensional SGD dynamics for these coordinates. Our analysis reveals two distinct training phases: escape from uninformative initialization and alignment with the target subspace, and demonstrates how the sequence length and positional encoding influence convergence speed and learning trajectories. These results provide a rigorous and interpretable foundation for understanding how sequential structure in data can be beneficial for learning with attention-based models.</description>

      <title>Computational Thresholds in Multi-Modal Learning via the Spiked Matrix-Tensor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recovery of multiple high-dimensional signals from two noisy, correlated modalities: a spiked matrix and a spiked tensor sharing a common low-rank structure. This setting generalizes classical spiked matrix and tensor models, unveiling intricate interactions between inference channels and surprising algorithmic behaviors. Notably, while the spiked tensor model is typically intractable at low signal-to-noise ratios, its correlation with the matrix enables efficient recovery via Bayesian Approximate Message Passing, inducing staircase-like phase transitions reminiscent of neural network phenomena. In contrast, empirical risk minimization for joint learning fails: the tensor component obstructs effective matrix recovery, and joint optimization significantly degrades performance, highlighting the limitations of naive multi-modal learning. We show that a simple Sequential Curriculum Learning strategy-first recovering the matrix, then leveraging it to guide tensor recovery-resolves this bottleneck and achieves optimal weak recovery thresholds. This strategy, implementable with spectral methods, emphasizes the critical role of structural correlation and learning order in multi-modal high-dimensional inference.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) offer a powerful framework for sampling graphs in proportion to their rewards. However, existing approaches suffer from systematic biases due to inaccuracies in state transition probability computations. These biases, rooted in the inherent symmetries of graphs, impact both atom-based and fragment-based generation schemes. To address this challenge, we introduce Symmetry-Aware GFlowNets (SA-GFN), a method that incorporates symmetry corrections into the learning process through reward scaling. By integrating bias correction directly into the reward structure, SA-GFN eliminates the need for explicit state transition computations. Empirical results show that SA-GFN enables unbiased sampling while enhancing diversity and consistently generating high-reward graphs that closely match the target distribution.</description>

      <title>Safely Learning Controlled Stochastic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of safely learning controlled stochastic dynamics from discrete-time trajectory observations, ensuring system trajectories remain within predefined safe regions during both training and deployment. Safety-critical constraints of this kind are crucial in applications such as autonomous robotics, finance, and biomedicine. We introduce a method that ensures safe exploration and efficient estimation of system dynamics by iteratively expanding an initial known safe control set using kernel-based confidence bounds. After training, the learned model enables predictions of the system's dynamics and permits safety verification of any given control. Our approach requires only mild smoothness assumptions and access to an initial safe control set, enabling broad applicability to complex real-world systems. We provide theoretical guarantees for safety and derive adaptive learning rates that improve with increasing Sobolev regularity of the true dynamics. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our method in terms of safety, estimation accuracy, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Doubly-Robust Estimation of Counterfactual Policy Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the distribution of outcomes under counterfactual policies is critical for decision-making in domains such as recommendation, advertising, and healthcare. We analyze a novel framework-Counterfactual Policy Mean Embedding (CPME)-that represents the entire counterfactual outcome distribution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling flexible and nonparametric distributional off-policy evaluation. We introduce both a plug-in estimator and a doubly robust estimator; the latter enjoys improved uniform convergence rates by correcting for bias in both the outcome embedding and propensity models. Building on this, we develop a doubly robust kernel test statistic for hypothesis testing, which achieves asymptotic normality and thus enables computationally efficient testing and straightforward construction of confidence intervals. Our framework also supports sampling from the counterfactual distribution. Numerical simulations illustrate the practical benefits of CPME over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically perfect seeded graph matching without edge correlation (and applications to inference)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha&lt;2\wedge d/4$ -- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power. We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from connectomics and machine translation.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary Bandit Convex Optimization: A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandit Convex Optimization is a fundamental class of sequential decision-making problems, where the learner selects actions from a continuous domain and observes a loss (but not its gradient) at only one point per round. We study this problem in non-stationary environments, and aim to minimize the regret under three standard measures of non-stationarity: the number of switches $S$ in the comparator sequence, the total variation $\Delta$ of the loss functions, and the path-length $P$ of the comparator sequence. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm, Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average with Sleeping Experts (TEWA-SE), which adapts the sleeping experts framework from online convex optimization to the bandit setting. For strongly convex losses, we prove that TEWA-SE is minimax-optimal with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$ by establishing matching upper and lower bounds. By equipping TEWA-SE with the Bandit-over-Bandit framework, we extend our analysis to environments with unknown non-stationarity measures. For general convex losses, we introduce a second algorithm, clipped Exploration by Optimization (cExO), based on exponential weights over a discretized action space. While not polynomial-time computable, this method achieves minimax-optimal regret with respect to known $S$ and $\Delta$, and improves on the best existing bounds with respect to $P$.</description>

      <title>Causal Explainability of Machine Learning in Heart Failure Prediction from Electronic Health Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is explained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the predictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal relationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart failure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of important variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent regression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the cause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a new computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and score the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary) clinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we investigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature types: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal features. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal relationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature importance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees) strongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without differentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal for HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can be used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based prediction modeling.</description>

      <title>GL-LowPopArt: A Nearly Instance-Wise Minimax-Optimal Estimator for Generalized Low-Rank Trace Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03074v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present `GL-LowPopArt`, a novel Catoni-style estimator for generalized low-rank trace regression. Building on `LowPopArt` (Jang et al., 2024), it employs a two-stage approach: nuclear norm regularization followed by matrix Catoni estimation. We establish state-of-the-art estimation error bounds, surpassing existing guarantees (Fan et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2022), and reveal a novel experimental design objective, $\mathrm{GL}(\pi)$. The key technical challenge is controlling bias from the nonlinear inverse link function, which we address by our two-stage approach. We prove a *local* minimax lower bound, showing that our `GL-LowPopArt` enjoys instance-wise optimality up to the condition number of the ground-truth Hessian. Applications include generalized linear matrix completion, where `GL-LowPopArt` achieves a state-of-the-art Frobenius error guarantee, and **bilinear dueling bandits**, a novel setting inspired by general preference learning (Zhang et al., 2024). Our analysis of a `GL-LowPopArt`-based explore-then-commit algorithm reveals a new, potentially interesting problem-dependent quantity, along with improved Borda regret bound than vectorization (Wu et al., 2024).</description>

Abstract: Dynamic microsimulation has long been recognized as a powerful tool for policy analysis, but in fact most major health policy simulations lack path dependency, a critical feature for evaluating policies that depend on accumulated outcomes such as retirement savings, wealth, or debt. We propose the Longitudinal Health, Income and Employment Model (LHIEM), a path-dependent discrete-time microsimulation that predicts annual health care expenditures, family income, and health status for the U.S. population over a multi-year period. LHIEM advances the population from year to year as a Markov chain with modules capturing the particular dynamics of each predictive attribute. LHIEM was designed to assess a health care financing proposal that would allow individuals to borrow from the U.S. government to cover health care costs, requiring careful tracking of medical expenditures and medical debt over time. However, LHIEM is flexible enough to be used for a range of modeling needs related to predicting health care spending and income over time. In this paper, we present the details of the model and all dynamic modules, and include a case study to demonstrate how LHIEM can be used to evaluate proposed policy changes.</description>

      <title>Memorization to Generalization: Emergence of Diffusion Models from Associative Memory</title>

Abstract: Hopfield networks are associative memory (AM) systems, designed for storing and retrieving patterns as local minima of an energy landscape. In the classical Hopfield model, an interesting phenomenon occurs when the amount of training data reaches its critical memory load $- spurious\,\,states$, or unintended stable points, emerge at the end of the retrieval dynamics, leading to incorrect recall. In this work, we examine diffusion models, commonly used in generative modeling, from the perspective of AMs. The training phase of diffusion model is conceptualized as memory encoding (training data is stored in the memory). The generation phase is viewed as an attempt of memory retrieval. In the small data regime the diffusion model exhibits a strong memorization phase, where the network creates distinct basins of attraction around each sample in the training set, akin to the Hopfield model below the critical memory load. In the large data regime, a different phase appears where an increase in the size of the training set fosters the creation of new attractor states that correspond to manifolds of the generated samples. Spurious states appear at the boundary of this transition and correspond to emergent attractor states, which are absent in the training set, but, at the same time, have distinct basins of attraction around them. Our findings provide: a novel perspective on the memorization-generalization phenomenon in diffusion models via the lens of AMs, theoretical prediction of existence of spurious states, empirical validation of this prediction in commonly-used diffusion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents $whittlehurst$, a Python package implementing Whittle's likelihood method for estimating the Hurst exponent in fractional Brownian motion (fBm). While the theoretical foundations of Whittle's estimator are well-established, practical and computational considerations are critical for effective use. We focus explicitly on assessing our implementation's performance across several numerical approximations of the fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) spectral density, comparing their computational efficiency, accuracy, and consistency across varying input sequence lengths. Extensive empirical evaluations show that our implementation achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy and computational speed. Additionally, we benchmark our method against other popular Hurst exponent estimation techniques on synthetic and real-world data, emphasizing practical considerations that arise when applying these estimators to financial and biomedical data.</description>

      <title>A meaningful prediction of functional decline in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on multi-event survival analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life; however, due to the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study, we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R&lt;=2) with respect to five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking and breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset by training five covariate-based survival models to estimate the probability of an event over a 500-day period after a baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival distributions (ISDs) for each patient, each providing an interpretable and meaningful estimate of when that event will likely take place in the future. The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, our method enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions, where certain features (covariates) can be changed to see their effect on the predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little to no impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset ALS, our method predicts considerably shorter counterfactual time-to-event estimates for tasks related to speech and swallowing compared to limb-onset ALS. The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning against Noisy Clients via Masked Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework, MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients' data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities.

      <title>Temporal Causal-based Simulation for Realistic Time-series Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal Discovery plays a pivotal role in revealing relationships among observed variables, particularly in the temporal setup. While the majority of CD methods rely on synthetic data for evaluation, and recently for training, these fall short in accurately mirroring real-world scenarios; an effect even more evident in temporal data. Generation techniques depending on simplified assumptions on causal structure, effects and time, limit the quality and diversity of the simulated data. In this work, we introduce Temporal Causal-based Simulation (TCS), a robust framework for generating realistic time-series data and their associated temporal causal graphs. The approach is structured in three phases: estimating the true lagged causal structure of the data, approximating the functional dependencies between variables and learning the noise distribution of the corresponding causal model, each part of which can be explicitly tailored based on data assumptions and characteristics. Through an extensive evaluation process, we highlight that single detection methods for generated data discrimination prove inadequate, accentuating it as a multifaceted challenge. For this, we detail a Min-max optimization phase that draws on AutoML techniques. Our contributions include a flexible, model-agnostic pipeline for generating realistic temporal causal data, a thorough evaluation setup which enhances the validity of the generated datasets and insights into the challenges posed by realistic data generation. Through experiments involving not only real but also semi-synthetic and purely synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that while sampling realistic causal data remains a complex task, our method enriches the domain of generating sensible causal-based temporal data.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Generalization and Interpretability in Unsupervised Concept-Based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To increase the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, it is critical to improve the understanding of how they make decisions. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised concept-based model for image classification, named Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) which models concepts as random variables within a Bernoulli latent space. Unlike traditional methods that either require extensive human supervision or suffer from limited scalability, our approach employs a reduced number of concepts without sacrificing performance. We demonstrate that LCBM surpasses existing unsupervised concept-based models in generalization capability and nearly matches the performance of black-box models. The proposed concept representation enhances information retention and aligns more closely with human understanding. A user study demonstrates the discovered concepts are also more intuitive for humans to interpret. Finally, despite the use of concept embeddings, we maintain model interpretability by means of a local linear combination of concepts.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact variational flows via involutive MCMC kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most expressive variational families -- such as normalizing flows -- lack practical convergence guarantees, as their theoretical assurances typically hold only at the intractable global optimum. In this work, we present a general recipe for constructing tuning-free, asymptotically exact variational flows from involutive MCMC kernels. The core methodological component is a novel representation of general involutive MCMC kernels as invertible, measure-preserving iterated random function systems, which act as the flow maps of our variational flows. This leads to three new variational families with provable total variation convergence. Our framework resolves key practical limitations of existing variational families with similar guarantees (e.g., MixFlows), while requiring substantially weaker theoretical assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive performance of our flows across tasks including posterior approximation, Monte Carlo estimates, and normalization constant estimation, outperforming or matching No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) and black-box normalizing flows.</description>

      <title>Constrained Sliced Wasserstein Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple 1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach in learning more informative slicing directions. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/Stranja572/constrainedswe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Interpolants (SI) are a powerful framework for generative modeling, capable of flexibly transforming between two probability distributions. However, their use in jointly optimized latent variable models remains unexplored as they require direct access to the samples from the two distributions. This work presents Latent Stochastic Interpolants (LSI) enabling joint learning in a latent space with end-to-end optimized encoder, decoder and latent SI models. We achieve this by developing a principled Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective derived directly in continuous time. The joint optimization allows LSI to learn effective latent representations along with a generative process that transforms an arbitrary prior distribution into the encoder-defined aggregated posterior. LSI sidesteps the simple priors of the normal diffusion models and mitigates the computational demands of applying SI directly in high-dimensional observation spaces, while preserving the generative flexibility of the SI framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of LSI through comprehensive experiments on the standard large scale ImageNet generation benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CACTI, a masked autoencoding approach for imputing tabular data that leverages the structure in missingness patterns and contextual information. Our approach employs a novel median truncated copy masking training strategy that encourages the model to learn from empirical patterns of missingness while incorporating semantic relationships between features - captured by column names and text descriptions - to better represent feature dependence. These dual sources of inductive bias enable CACTI to outperform state-of-the-art methods - an average $R^2$ gain of 7.8% over the next best method (13.4%, 6.1%, and 5.3% under missing not at random, at random and completely at random, respectively) - across a diverse range of datasets and missingness conditions. Our results highlight the value of leveraging dataset-specific contextual information and missingness patterns to enhance imputation performance.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Probabilistic Dirichlet-to-Neumann Maps on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Markov Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Value decomposition has long been a fundamental technique in multi-agent dynamic programming and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, the value function of a global state $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)$ is often approximated as the sum of local functions: $V(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_N)\approx\sum_{i=1}^N V_i(s_i)$. This approach traces back to the index policy in restless multi-armed bandit problems and has found various applications in modern RL systems. However, the theoretical justification for why this decomposition works so effectively remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we uncover the underlying mathematical structure that enables value decomposition. We demonstrate that a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) permits value decomposition if and only if its transition matrix is not "entangled" -- a concept analogous to quantum entanglement in quantum physics. Drawing inspiration from how physicists measure quantum entanglement, we introduce how to measure the "Markov entanglement" for multi-agent MDPs and show that this measure can be used to bound the decomposition error in general multi-agent MDPs.
  Using the concept of Markov entanglement, we proved that a widely-used class of index policies is weakly entangled and enjoys a sublinear $\mathcal O(\sqrt{N})$ scale of decomposition error for $N$-agent systems. Finally, we show how Markov entanglement can be efficiently estimated in practice, providing practitioners with an empirical proxy for the quality of value decomposition.</description>

      <title>Random at First, Fast at Last: NTK-Guided Fourier Pre-Processing for Tabular DL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While random Fourier features are a classic tool in kernel methods, their utility as a pre-processing step for deep learning on tabular data has been largely overlooked. Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free, architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii) introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.</description>

      <title>Simple, Good, Fast: Self-Supervised World Models Free of Baggage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are the essential components of world models? How far do we get with world models that are not employing RNNs, transformers, discrete representations, and image reconstructions? This paper introduces SGF, a Simple, Good, and Fast world model that uses self-supervised representation learning, captures short-time dependencies through frame and action stacking, and enhances robustness against model errors through data augmentation. We extensively discuss SGF's connections to established world models, evaluate the building blocks in ablation studies, and demonstrate good performance through quantitative comparisons on the Atari 100k benchmark.</description>

      <title>Online Bayesian system identification in multivariate autoregressive models via message passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a recursive Bayesian estimation procedure for multivariate autoregressive models with exogenous inputs based on message passing in a factor graph. Unlike recursive least-squares, our method produces full posterior distributions for both the autoregressive coefficients and noise precision. The uncertainties regarding these estimates propagate into the uncertainties on predictions for future system outputs, and support online model evidence calculations. We demonstrate convergence empirically on a synthetic autoregressive system and competitive performance on a double mass-spring-damper system.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Performance Guarantees for Partial Domain Adaptation via Partial Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many scenarios of practical interest, labeled data from a target distribution are scarce while labeled data from a related source distribution are abundant. One particular setting of interest arises when the target label space is a subset of the source label space, leading to the framework of partial domain adaptation (PDA). Typical approaches to PDA involve minimizing a domain alignment term and a weighted empirical loss on the source data, with the aim of transferring knowledge between domains. However, a theoretical basis for this procedure is lacking, and in particular, most existing weighting schemes are heuristic. In this work, we derive generalization bounds for the PDA problem based on partial optimal transport. These bounds corroborate the use of the partial Wasserstein distance as a domain alignment term, and lead to theoretically motivated explicit expressions for the empirical source loss weights. Inspired by these bounds, we devise a practical algorithm for PDA, termed WARMPOT. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that WARMPOT is competitive with recent approaches, and that our proposed weights improve on existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Adaptive Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-arm bandit experimental designs are increasingly being adopted over standard randomized trials due to their potential to improve outcomes for study participants, enable faster identification of the best-performing options, and/or enhance the precision of estimating key parameters. Current approaches for inference after adaptive sampling either rely on asymptotic normality under restricted experiment designs or underpowered martingale concentration inequalities that lead to weak power in practice. To bypass these limitations, we propose a simulation-based approach for conducting hypothesis tests and constructing confidence intervals for arm specific means and their differences. Our simulation-based approach uses positively biased nuisances to generate additional trajectories of the experiment, which we call \textit{simulation with optimism}. Using these simulations, we characterize the distribution potentially non-normal sample mean test statistic to conduct inference. We provide guarantees for (i) asymptotic type I error control, (ii) convergence of our confidence intervals, and (iii) asymptotic strong consistency of our estimator over a wide variety of common bandit designs. Our empirical results show that our approach achieves the desired coverage while reducing confidence interval widths by up to 50%, with drastic improvements for arms not targeted by the design.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Predicting Agents from Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas including fairness and safety.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Practice with RAVEN-UCB: Addressing Non-Stationarity in Multi-Armed Bandits through Variance Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is challenging in non-stationary environments where reward distributions evolve dynamically. We introduce RAVEN-UCB, a novel algorithm that combines theoretical rigor with practical efficiency via variance-aware adaptation. It achieves tighter regret bounds than UCB1 and UCB-V, with gap-dependent regret of order $K \sigma_{\max}^2 \log T / \Delta$ and gap-independent regret of order $\sqrt{K T \log T}$. RAVEN-UCB incorporates three innovations: (1) variance-driven exploration using $\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}_k^2 / (N_k + 1)}$ in confidence bounds, (2) adaptive control via $\alpha_t = \alpha_0 / \log(t + \epsilon)$, and (3) constant-time recursive updates for efficiency. Experiments across non-stationary patterns - distributional changes, periodic shifts, and temporary fluctuations - in synthetic and logistics scenarios demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, confirming theoretical and practical robustness.</description>

      <title>On the Need to Align Intent and Implementation in Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying uncertainties for machine learning (ML) models is a foundational challenge in modern data analysis. This challenge is compounded by at least two key aspects of the field: (a) inconsistent terminology surrounding uncertainty and estimation across disciplines, and (b) the varying technical requirements for establishing trustworthy uncertainties in diverse problem contexts. In this position paper, we aim to clarify the depth of these challenges by identifying these inconsistencies and articulating how different contexts impose distinct epistemic demands. We examine the current landscape of estimation targets (e.g., prediction, inference, simulation-based inference), uncertainty constructs (e.g., frequentist, Bayesian, fiducial), and the approaches used to map between them. Drawing on the literature, we highlight and explain examples of problematic mappings. To help address these issues, we advocate for standards that promote alignment between the \textit{intent} and \textit{implementation} of uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. We discuss several axes of trustworthiness that are necessary (if not sufficient) for reliable UQ in ML models, and show how these axes can inform the design and evaluation of uncertainty-aware ML systems. Our practical recommendations focus on scientific ML, offering illustrative cases and use scenarios, particularly in the context of simulation-based inference (SBI).</description>

      <title>Sample complexity of Schr\"odinger potential estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of Schr\"odinger potential estimation, which plays a crucial role in modern generative modelling approaches based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control for SDEs. Given a simple prior diffusion process, these methods search for a path between two given distributions $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ requiring minimal efforts. The optimal drift in this case can be expressed through a Schr\"odinger potential. In the present paper, we study generalization ability of an empirical Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk minimizer over a class of admissible log-potentials aimed at fitting the marginal distribution at time $T$. Under reasonable assumptions on the target distribution $\rho_T^*$ and the prior process, we derive a non-asymptotic high-probability upper bound on the KL-divergence between $\rho_T^*$ and the terminal density corresponding to the estimated log-potential. In particular, we show that the excess KL-risk may decrease as fast as $O(\log^2 n / n)$ when the sample size $n$ tends to infinity even if both $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ have unbounded supports.</description>

      <title>On the Benefits of Accelerated Optimization in Robust and Private Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the advantages of accelerated gradient methods, specifically based on the Frank-Wolfe method and projected gradient descent, for privacy and heavy-tailed robustness. Our approaches are as follows: For the Frank-Wolfe method, our technique is based on a tailored learning rate and a uniform lower bound on the gradient of the $\ell_2$-norm over the constraint set. For accelerating projected gradient descent, we use the popular variant based on Nesterov's momentum, and we optimize our objective over $\mathbb{R}^p$. These accelerations reduce iteration complexity, translating into stronger statistical guarantees for empirical and population risk minimization. Our analysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and parametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models). Methodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy gradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and advanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric median-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension of the covariates. Finally, we compare our rates to existing bounds and identify scenarios where our methods attain optimal convergence.</description>

      <title>Multi-Metric Adaptive Experimental Design under Fixed Budget with Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard A/B tests in online experiments face statistical power challenges when testing multiple candidates simultaneously, while adaptive experimental designs (AED) alone fall short in inferring experiment statistics such as the average treatment effect, especially with many metrics (e.g., revenue, safety) and heterogeneous variances. This paper proposes a fixed-budget multi-metric AED framework with a two-phase structure: an adaptive exploration phase to identify the best treatment, and a validation phase with an A/B test to verify the treatment's quality and infer statistics. We propose SHRVar, which generalizes sequential halving (SH) (Karnin et al., 2013) with a novel relative-variance-based sampling and an elimination strategy built on reward z-values. It achieves a provable error probability that decreases exponentially, where the exponent generalizes the complexity measure for SH (Karnin et al., 2013) and SHVar (Lalitha et al., 2023) with homogeneous and heterogeneous variances, respectively. Numerical experiments verify our analysis and demonstrate the superior performance of this new framework.</description>

      <title>Provable Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with an Unknown Link Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link functions, which characterize how human preferences are generated from the value function of an RL problem, are a crucial component in designing RLHF algorithms. Almost all RLHF algorithms, including state-of-the-art ones in empirical studies such as DPO and PPO, assume the link function is known to the agent (e.g., a logistic function according to the Bradley-Terry model), which is arguably unrealistic considering the complex nature of human preferences. To avoid link function mis-specification, this paper studies general RLHF problems with unknown link functions. We propose a novel policy optimization algorithm called ZSPO based on a new zeroth-order policy optimization method, where the key is to use human preference to construct a parameter update direction that is positively correlated with the true policy gradient direction. ZSPO achieves it by estimating the sign of the value function difference instead of estimating the gradient from the value function difference, so it does not require knowing the link function. Under mild conditions, ZSPO converges to a stationary policy with a polynomial convergence rate depending on the number of policy iterations and trajectories per iteration. Numerical results also show the superiority of ZSPO under link function mismatch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling of classification error rates with respect to the size of the training dataset. In contrast to classical results where rates are minimax optimal for a problem class, this work starts with the empirical observation that, even for a fixed data distribution, the error scaling can have \emph{diverse} rates across different ranges of sample size. To understand when and why the error rate is non-uniform, we theoretically analyze nearest neighbor classifiers. We show that an error scaling law can have fine-grained rates: in the early phase, the test error depends polynomially on the data dimension and decreases fast; whereas in the later phase, the error depends exponentially on the data dimension and decreases slowly. Our analysis highlights the complexity of the data distribution in determining the test error. When the data are distributed benignly, we show that the generalization error of nearest neighbor classifier can depend polynomially, instead of exponentially, on the data dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning with broad real-world applications. While spectral clustering methods for undirected graphs are well-established and guided by a minimum cut optimization consensus, their extension to directed graphs remains relatively underexplored due to the additional complexity introduced by edge directions. In this paper, we leverage statistical inference on stochastic block models to guide the development of a spectral clustering algorithm for directed graphs. Specifically, we study the maximum likelihood estimation under a widely used directed stochastic block model, and derive a global objective function that aligns with the underlying community structure. We further establish a theoretical upper bound on the misclustering error of its spectral relaxation, and based on this relaxation, introduce a novel, self-adaptive spectral clustering method for directed graphs. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>A Hessian-Aware Stochastic Differential Equation for Modelling SGD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time approximation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a crucial tool to study its escaping behaviors from stationary points. However, existing stochastic differential equation (SDE) models fail to fully capture these behaviors, even for simple quadratic objectives. Built on a novel stochastic backward error analysis framework, we derive the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Modified Equation (HA-SME), an SDE that incorporates Hessian information of the objective function into both its drift and diffusion terms. Our analysis shows that HA-SME achieves the order-best approximation error guarantee among existing SDE models in the literature, while significantly reducing the dependence on the smoothness parameter of the objective. Empirical experiments on neural network-based loss functions further validate this improvement. Further, for quadratic objectives, under mild conditions, HA-SME is proved to be the first SDE model that recovers exactly the SGD dynamics in the distributional sense. Consequently, when the local landscape near a stationary point can be approximated by quadratics, HA-SME provides a more precise characterization of the local escaping behaviors of SGD. With the enhanced approximation guarantee, we further conduct an escape time analysis using HA-SME, showcasing how it can be employed to analytically study the escaping behavior of SGD for general function classes.</description>

      <title>Sample-efficient Learning of Concepts with Theoretical Guarantees: from Data to Concepts without Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is a vital part of many real-world systems, but several concerns remain about the lack of interpretability, explainability and robustness of black-box AI systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) address some of these challenges by learning interpretable concepts from high-dimensional data, e.g. images, which are used to predict labels. An important issue in CBMs are spurious correlation between concepts, which effectively lead to learning "wrong" concepts. Current mitigating strategies have strong assumptions, e.g., they assume that the concepts are statistically independent of each other, or require substantial interaction in terms of both interventions and labels provided by annotators. In this paper, we describe a framework that provides theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the learned concepts and on the number of required labels, without requiring any interventions. Our framework leverages causal representation learning (CRL) methods to learn latent causal variables from high-dimensional observations in a unsupervised way, and then learns to align these variables with interpretable concepts with few concept labels. We propose a linear and a non-parametric estimator for this mapping, providing a finite-sample high probability result in the linear case and an asymptotic consistency result for the non-parametric estimator. We evaluate our framework in synthetic and image benchmarks, showing that the learned concepts have less impurities and are often more accurate than other CBMs, even in settings with strong correlations between concepts.</description>

Abstract: One of the most basic lower bounds in machine learning is that in nearly any nontrivial setting, it takes $\textit{at least}$ $1/\epsilon$ samples to learn to error $\epsilon$ (and more, if the classifier being learned is complex). However, suppose that data points are agents who have the ability to improve by a small amount if doing so will allow them to receive a (desired) positive classification. In that case, we may actually be able to achieve $\textit{zero}$ error by just being "close enough". For example, imagine a hiring test used to measure an agent's skill at some job such that for some threshold $\theta$, agents who score above $\theta$ will be successful and those who score below $\theta$ will not (i.e., learning a threshold on the line). Suppose also that by putting in effort, agents can improve their skill level by some small amount $r$. In that case, if we learn an approximation $\hat{\theta}$ of $\theta$ such that $\theta \leq \hat{\theta} \leq \theta + r$ and use it for hiring, we can actually achieve error zero, in the sense that (a) any agent classified as positive is truly qualified, and (b) any agent who truly is qualified can be classified as positive by putting in effort. Thus, the ability for agents to improve has the potential to allow for a goal one could not hope to achieve in standard models, namely zero error.
  In this paper, we explore this phenomenon more broadly, giving general results and examining under what conditions the ability of agents to improve can allow for a reduction in the sample complexity of learning, or alternatively, can make learning harder. We also examine both theoretically and empirically what kinds of improvement-aware algorithms can take into account agents who have the ability to improve to a limited extent when it is in their interest to do so.</description>

      <title>Automatic Cross-Domain Transfer Learning for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.04088v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning research attempts to make model induction transferable across different domains. This method assumes that specific information regarding to which domain each instance belongs is known. This paper helps to extend the capability of transfer learning for linear regression problems to situations where the domain information is uncertain or unknown; in fact, the framework can be extended to classification problems. For normal datasets, we assume that some latent domain information is available for transfer learning. The instances in each domain can be inferred by different parameters. We obtain this domain information from the distribution of the regression coefficients corresponding to the explanatory variable $x$ as well as the response variable $y$ based on a Dirichlet process, which is more reasonable. As a result, we transfer not only variable $x$ as usual but also variable $y$, which is challenging since the testing data have no response value. Previous work mainly overcomes the problem via pseudo-labelling based on transductive learning, which introduces serious bias. We provide a novel framework for analysing the problem and considering this general situation: the joint distribution of variable $x$ and variable $y$. Furthermore, our method controls the bias well compared with previous work. We perform linear regression on the new feature space that consists of different latent domains and the target domain, which is from the testing data. The experimental results show that the proposed model performs well on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Accelerate Langevin Sampling with Birth-Death Process and Exploration Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling a probability distribution with known likelihood is a fundamental task in computational science and engineering. Aiming at multimodality, we propose a new sampling method that takes advantage of both birth-death process and exploration component. The main idea of this method is look before you leap. We keep two sets of samplers, one at warmer temperature and one at original temperature. The former one serves as pioneer in exploring new modes and passing useful information to the other, while the latter one samples the target distribution after receiving the information. We derive a mean-field limit and show how the exploration component accelerates the sampling process. Moreover, we prove exponential asymptotic convergence under mild assumption. Finally, we test on experiments from previous literature and compare our methodology to previous ones.</description>

      <title>Density Ratio Estimation-based Bayesian Optimization with Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15612v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization has attracted huge attention from diverse research areas in science and engineering, since it is capable of efficiently finding a global optimum of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In general, a probabilistic regression model is widely used as a surrogate function to model an explicit distribution over function evaluations given an input to estimate and a training dataset. Beyond the probabilistic regression-based methods, density ratio estimation-based Bayesian optimization has been suggested in order to estimate a density ratio of the groups relatively close and relatively far to a global optimum. Developing this line of research further, supervised classifiers are employed to estimate a class probability for the two groups instead of a density ratio. However, the supervised classifiers used in this strategy are prone to be overconfident for known knowledge on global solution candidates. Supposing that we have access to unlabeled points, e.g., predefined fixed-size pools, we propose density ratio estimation-based Bayesian optimization with semi-supervised learning to solve this challenge. Finally, we show the empirical results of our methods and several baseline methods in two distinct scenarios with unlabeled point sampling and a fixed-size pool, and analyze the validity of our methods in diverse experiments.</description>

      <title>Why Shallow Networks Struggle to Approximate and Learn High Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive study combining mathematical and computational analysis to explain why a two-layer neural network struggles to handle high frequencies in both approximation and learning, especially when machine precision, numerical noise, and computational cost are significant factors in practice. Specifically, we investigate the following fundamental computational issues: (1) the minimal numerical error achievable under finite precision, (2) the computational cost required to attain a given accuracy, and (3) the stability of the method with respect to perturbations. The core of our analysis lies in the conditioning of the representation and its learning dynamics. Explicit answers to these questions are provided, along with supporting numerical evidence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning to predict the next state of a dynamical system when the underlying evolution function is unknown. Unlike previous work, we place no parametric assumptions on the dynamical system, and study the problem from a learning theory perspective. We define new combinatorial measures and dimensions and show that they quantify the optimal mistake and regret bounds in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively. By doing so, we find that in the realizable setting, the total number of mistakes can grow according to \emph{any} increasing function of the time horizon $T$. In contrast, we show that in the agnostic setting under the commonly studied notion of Markovian regret, the only possible rates are $\Theta(T)$ and $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm: The Superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial in relation to the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interacting particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under the best known rate.</description>

      <title>Iterative Methods for Full-Scale Gaussian Process Approximations for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible probabilistic regression models which are widely used in statistics and machine learning. However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, full-scale approximations (FSAs) combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce computational costs in calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. In particular, we introduce a novel preconditioner and show theoretically and empirically that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Furthermore, we introduce an accurate and fast way to calculate predictive variances using stochastic simulation and iterative methods. In addition, we show how our newly proposed FITC preconditioner can also be used in iterative methods for Vecchia approximations. In our experiments, it outperforms existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for Vecchia approximations. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are deep probabilistic models that represent stochastic processes by conditioning their prior distributions on a set of context points. Despite their advantages in uncertainty estimation for complex distributions, NPs enforce parameterization coupling between the conditional prior model and the posterior model. We show that this coupling amounts to prior misspecification and revisit the NP objective to address this issue. More specifically, we propose R\'enyi Neural Processes (RNP), a method that replaces the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence, dampening the effects of the misspecified prior during posterior updates. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks including regression and image inpainting tasks, and show significant performance improvements of RNPs in real-world problems. Our extensive experiments show consistently better log-likelihoods over state-of-the-art NP models.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems under Smoothness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint learning of multiple linear dynamical systems. This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems, each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).</description>

      <title>Structured and Balanced Multi-Component and Multi-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a balanced multi-component and multi-layer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features, in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multi-component approach, in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multi-layer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multi-component structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been shown effective to generate combinatorial objects with desired properties. We here propose a new GFlowNet training framework, with policy-dependent rewards, that bridges keeping flow balance of GFlowNets to optimizing the expected accumulated reward in traditional Reinforcement-Learning (RL). This enables the derivation of new policy-based GFlowNet training methods, in contrast to existing ones resembling value-based RL. It is known that the design of backward policies in GFlowNet training affects efficiency. We further develop a coupled training strategy that jointly solves GFlowNet forward policy training and backward policy design. Performance analysis is provided with a theoretical guarantee of our policy-based GFlowNet training. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets verify that our policy-based strategies provide advanced RL perspectives for robust gradient estimation to improve GFlowNet performance.</description>

      <title>eGAD! double descent is explained by Generalized Aliasing Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of predictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor multiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance decomposition.
  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance and model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts: 1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much smaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points, and 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications, including random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from signal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive formation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and discuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Diffusion Guidance: A Derivative-free Method for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When solving inverse problems, one increasingly popular approach is to use pre-trained diffusion models as plug-and-play priors. This framework can accommodate different forward models without re-training while preserving the generative capability of diffusion models. Despite their success in many imaging inverse problems, most existing methods rely on privileged information such as derivative, pseudo-inverse, or full knowledge about the forward model. This reliance poses a substantial limitation that restricts their use in a wide range of problems where such information is unavailable, such as in many scientific applications. We propose Ensemble Kalman Diffusion Guidance (EnKG), a derivative-free approach that can solve inverse problems by only accessing forward model evaluations and a pre-trained diffusion model prior. We study the empirical effectiveness of EnKG across various inverse problems, including scientific settings such as inferring fluid flows and astronomical objects, which are highly non-linear inverse problems that often only permit black-box access to the forward model. We open-source our code at https://github.com/devzhk/enkg-pytorch.</description>

      <title>HardNet: Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has attracted significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction, especially on inputs far from the training distribution -- an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet is expressive and retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers with guaranteed feasibility, and optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Discovering Latent Causal Graphs from Spatio-Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important phenomena in scientific fields like climate, neuroscience, and epidemiology are naturally represented as spatiotemporal gridded data with complex interactions. Inferring causal relationships from these data is a challenging problem compounded by the high dimensionality of such data and the correlations between spatially proximate points. We present SPACY (SPAtiotemporal Causal discoverY), a novel framework based on variational inference, designed to model latent time series and their causal relationships from spatiotemporal data. SPACY alleviates the high-dimensional challenge by discovering causal structures in the latent space. To aggregate spatially proximate, correlated grid points, we use \change{spatial factors, parametrized by spatial kernel functions}, to map observational time series to latent representations. \change{Theoretically, we generalize the problem to a continuous spatial domain and establish identifiability when the observations arise from a nonlinear, invertible function of the product of latent series and spatial factors. Using this approach, we avoid assumptions that are often unverifiable, including those about instantaneous effects or sufficient variability.} Empirically, SPACY outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data, even in challenging settings where existing methods struggle, while remaining scalable for large grids. SPACY also identifies key known phenomena from real-world climate data.</description>

      <title>On the Selection Stability of Stability Selection and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stability selection is a widely adopted resampling-based framework for high-dimensional variable selection. This paper seeks to broaden the use of an established stability estimator to evaluate the overall stability of the stability selection results, moving beyond single-variable analysis. We suggest that the stability estimator offers two advantages: it can serve as a reference to reflect the robustness of the results obtained, and it can help identify a Pareto optimal regularization value to improve stability. By determining the regularization value, we calibrate key stability selection parameters, namely, the decision-making threshold and the expected number of falsely selected variables, within established theoretical bounds. In addition, the convergence of stability values over successive sub-samples sheds light on the required number of sub-samples addressing a notable gap in prior studies. The \texttt{stabplot} R package is developed to facilitate the use of the methodology featured in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a minimalistic representation model for the head direction (HD) system, aiming to learn a high-dimensional representation of head direction that captures essential properties of HD cells. Our model is a representation of rotation group $U(1)$, and we study both the fully connected version and convolutional version. We demonstrate the emergence of Gaussian-like tuning profiles and a 2D circle geometry in both versions of the model. We also demonstrate that the learned model is capable of accurate path integration.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is about conformal prediction and related inferential techniques that build on permutation tests and exchangeability. These techniques are useful in a diverse array of tasks, including hypothesis testing and providing uncertainty quantification guarantees for machine learning systems. Much of the current interest in conformal prediction is due to its ability to integrate into complex machine learning workflows, solving the problem of forming prediction sets without any assumptions on the form of the data generating distribution. Since contemporary machine learning algorithms have generally proven difficult to analyze directly, conformal prediction's main appeal is its ability to provide formal, finite-sample guarantees when paired with such methods.
  The goal of this book is to teach the reader about the fundamental technical arguments that arise when researching conformal prediction and related questions in distribution-free inference. Many of these proof strategies, especially the more recent ones, are scattered among research papers, making it difficult for researchers to understand where to look, which results are important, and how exactly the proofs work. We hope to bridge this gap by curating what we believe to be some of the most important results in the literature and presenting their proofs in a unified language, with illustrations, and with an eye towards pedagogy.</description>

      <title>Ringmaster ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (Asynchronous SGD) is a cornerstone method for parallelizing learning in distributed machine learning. However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin &amp; Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Understanding Federated Learning from IID to Non-IID dataset: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.</description>

      <title>On the query complexity of sampling from non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional distribution with density $p(x)\propto e^{-f(x)}$, which does not necessarily satisfy good isoperimetric conditions.
  Specifically, we show that for any $L,M$ satisfying $LM\ge d\ge 5$, $\epsilon\in \left(0,\frac{1}{32}\right)$, and any algorithm with query accesses to the value of $f(x)$ and $\nabla f(x)$, there exists an $L$-log-smooth distribution with second moment at most $M$ such that the algorithm requires $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ queries to compute a sample whose distribution is within $\epsilon$ in total variation distance to the target distribution. We complement the lower bound with an algorithm requiring $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(d)}$ queries, thereby characterizing the tight (up to the constant in the exponent) query complexity for sampling from the family of non-log-concave distributions.
  Our results are in sharp contrast with the recent work of Huang et al. (COLT'24), where an algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity was proposed for sampling from a non-log-concave distribution when $M=\mathtt{poly}(d)$. Their algorithm works under the stronger condition that all distributions along the trajectory of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, starting from the target distribution, are $\mathcal{O}(1)$-log-smooth. We investigate this condition and prove that it is strictly stronger than requiring the target distribution to be $\mathcal O(1)$-log-smooth. Additionally, we study this condition in the context of mixtures of Gaussians.
  Finally, we place our results within the broader theme of ``sampling versus optimization'', as studied in Ma et al. (PNAS'19). We show that for a wide range of parameters, sampling is strictly easier than optimization by a super-exponential factor in the dimension $d$.</description>

      <title>Improved Margin Generalization Bounds for Voting Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a new margin-based generalization bound for voting classifiers, refining existing results and yielding tighter generalization guarantees for widely used boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost (Freund and Schapire, 1997). Furthermore, the new margin-based generalization bound enables the derivation of an optimal weak-to-strong learner: a Majority-of-3 large-margin classifiers with an expected error matching the theoretical lower bound. This result provides a more natural alternative to the Majority-of-5 algorithm by (H{\o}gsgaard et al., 2024), and matches the Majority-of-3 result by (Aden-Ali et al., 2024) for the realizable prediction model.</description>

      <title>CoT-UQ: Improving Response-wise Uncertainty Quantification in LLMs with Chain-of-Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks but struggle to accurately quantify uncertainty in their generated responses. This limitation makes it challenging to detect misinformation and ensure reliable decision-making. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for LLMs are primarily prompt-wise rather than response-wise, often requiring multiple response samples, which incurs high computational costs. Moreover, LLMs have been shown to be overconfident, particularly when using reasoning steps to derive their answers. In this work, we propose CoT-UQ, a response-wise UQ framework that integrates LLMs' inherent reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into the UQ process. CoT-UQ captures critical information during inference by extracting keywords from each reasoning step and assessing their importance to the final answer. This key reasoning information is then aggregated to produce a final uncertainty estimate. We conduct extensive experiments based on Llama Family with model sizes varying from 8B to 13B across logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-UQ significantly outperforms existing UQ methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.9% AUROC compared to current UQ methods.

      <title>Armijo Line-search Can Make (Stochastic) Gradient Descent Provably Faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Armijo line-search (Armijo-LS) is a standard method to set the step-size for gradient descent (GD). For smooth functions, Armijo-LS alleviates the need to know the global smoothness constant L and adapts to the ``local'' smoothness, enabling GD to converge faster. Existing theoretical analyses show that GD with Armijo-LS (GD-LS) can result in constant factor improvements over GD with a 1/L step-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). We strengthen these results and show that if the objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition, GD-LS can result in a faster convergence rate than GD(1/L). In particular, we prove that for convex objectives corresponding to logistic regression and multi-class classification, GD-LS can converge to the optimum at a linear rate, and hence improves over the sublinear convergence of GD(1/L). Furthermore, for non-convex objectives satisfying gradient domination (e.g., those corresponding to the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a logistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms tailored for these specific settings. Finally, we prove that under the interpolation assumption, for convex losses, stochastic GD with a stochastic line-search can match the fast convergence of GD-LS</description>

      <title>SyncSDE: A Probabilistic Framework for Diffusion Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There have been many attempts to leverage multiple diffusion models for collaborative generation, extending beyond the original domain. A prominent approach involves synchronizing multiple diffusion trajectories by mixing the estimated scores to artificially correlate the generation processes. However, existing methods rely on naive heuristics, such as averaging, without considering task specificity. These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often produce suboptimal results when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused; modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task. We further identify optimal correlation models per task, achieving better results than previous approaches that apply a single heuristic across all tasks without justification.</description>

      <title>Unifying and extending Diffusion Models through PDEs for solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative tools with applications in computer vision and scientific machine learning (SciML), where they have been used to solve large-scale probabilistic inverse problems. Traditionally, these models have been derived using principles of variational inference, denoising, statistical signal processing, and stochastic differential equations. In contrast to the conventional presentation, in this study we derive diffusion models using ideas from linear partial differential equations and demonstrate that this approach has several benefits that include a constructive derivation of the forward and reverse processes, a unified derivation of multiple formulations and sampling strategies, and the discovery of a new class of variance preserving models. We also apply the conditional version of these models to solve canonical conditional density estimation problems and challenging inverse problems. These problems help establish benchmarks for systematically quantifying the performance of different formulations and sampling strategies in this study and for future studies. Finally, we identify and implement a mechanism through which a single diffusion model can be applied to measurements obtained from multiple measurement operators. Taken together, the contents of this manuscript provide a new understanding of and several new directions in the application of diffusion models to solving physics-based inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Entropic bounds for conditionally Gaussian vectors and applications to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using entropic inequalities from information theory, we provide new bounds on the total variation and 2-Wasserstein distances between a conditionally Gaussian law and a Gaussian law with invertible covariance matrix. We apply our results to quantify the speed of convergence to Gaussian of a randomly initialized fully connected neural network and its derivatives - evaluated in a finite number of inputs - when the initialization is Gaussian and the sizes of the inner layers diverge to infinity. Our results require mild assumptions on the activation function, and allow one to recover optimal rates of convergence in a variety of distances, thus improving and extending the findings of Basteri and Trevisan (2023), Favaro et al. (2023), Trevisan (2024) and Apollonio et al. (2024). One of our main tools are the quantitative cumulant estimates established in Hanin (2024). As an illustration, we apply our results to bound the total variation distance between the Bayesian posterior law of the neural network and its derivatives, and the posterior law of the corresponding Gaussian limit: this yields quantitative versions of a posterior CLT by Hron et al. (2022), and extends several estimates by Trevisan (2024) to the total variation metric.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Transforming Latent Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generative framework for functions by integrating Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Transformer-based hypernetworks into latent variable models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming: a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining. We validate our approach across multiple modalities, demonstrating improved scalability, expressiveness, and generalization over existing INR-based generative models. Our findings establish a unified and flexible framework for learning structured function representations.</description>

      <title>A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.</description>

      <title>Place Cells as Proximity-Preserving Embeddings: From Multi-Scale Random Walk to Straight-Forward Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hippocampus enables spatial navigation through place cell populations forming cognitive maps. We propose proximity-preserving neural embeddings to encode multi-scale random walk transitions, where the inner product $\langle h(x, t), h(y, t) \rangle = q(y|x, t)$ represents normalized transition probabilities, with $h(x, t)$ as the embedding at location $x$ and $q(y|x, t)$ as the transition probability at scale $\sqrt{t}$. This scale hierarchy mirrors hippocampal dorsoventral organization. The embeddings $h(x, t)$ reduce pairwise spatial proximity into an environmental map, with Euclidean distances preserving proximity information. We use gradient ascent on $q(y|x, t)$ for straight-forward path planning, employing adaptive scale selection for trap-free, smooth trajectories, equivalent to minimizing embedding space distances. Matrix squaring ($P_{2t} = P_t^2$) efficiently builds global transitions from local ones ($P_1$), enabling preplay-like shortcut prediction. Experiments demonstrate localized place fields, multi-scale tuning, adaptability, and remapping, achieving robust navigation in complex environments. Our biologically plausible framework, extensible to theta-phase precession, unifies spatial and temporal coding for scalable navigation.</description>

      <title>G1: Teaching LLMs to Reason on Graphs with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.</description>

      <title>Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of smooth graph signals from partial linear measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a ``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are very sparse and disconnected.</description>

      <title>Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</description>

      <title>Gaussian mixture models as a proxy for interacting language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture models, potential modifications, and future research directions.</description>

      <title>A novel sensitivity analysis method for agent-based models stratifies in-silico tumor spheroid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA provides similar SA results to the popular Sobol' Method while also identifying four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>

      <title>It Takes a Good Model to Train a Good Model: Generalized Gaussian Priors for Optimized LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/shifeng3711/gg_prior.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This tutorial aims to provide signal processing (SP) and machine learning (ML) practitioners with vital tools, in an accessible way, to answer the question: How to deal with missing data? There are many strategies to handle incomplete signals. In this paper, we propose to group these strategies based on three common tasks: i) missing-data imputation, ii) estimation with missing values and iii) prediction with missing values. We focus on methodological and experimental results through specific case studies on real-world applications. Promising and future research directions, including a better integration of informative missingness, are also discussed. We hope that the proposed conceptual framework and the presentation of recent missing-data problems related will encourage researchers of the SP and ML communities to develop original methods and to efficiently deal with new applications involving missing data.</description>
