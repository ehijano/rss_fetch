      <title>Responsibility Gap in Collective Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The responsibility gap is a set of outcomes of a collective decision-making mechanism in which no single agent is individually responsible. In general, when designing a decision-making process, it is desirable to minimise the gap.
  The paper proposes a concept of an elected dictatorship. It shows that, in a perfect information setting, the gap is empty if and only if the mechanism is an elected dictatorship. It also proves that in an imperfect information setting, the class of gap-free mechanisms is positioned strictly between two variations of the class of elected dictatorships.</description>

      <title>Bi-LSTM based Multi-Agent DRL with Computation-aware Pruning for Agent Twins Migration in Vehicular Embodied AI Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network (VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches, we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination. Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays, demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent deployment.</description>

      <title>Stability in Single-Peaked Strategic Resource Selection Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strategic selection of resources by selfish agents has long been a key area of research, with Resource Selection Games and Congestion Games serving as prominent examples. In these traditional frameworks, agents choose from a set of resources, and their utility depends solely on the number of other agents utilizing the same respective resource, treating all agents as indistinguishable or anonymous. Only recently, the study of the Resource Selection Game with heterogeneous agents has begun, meaning agents have a type and the fraction of agents of their type at their resource is the basis of their decision-making. In this work, we initiate the study of the Resource Selection Game with heterogeneous agents in combination with single-peaked utility functions, as some research suggests that this may represent human decision-making in certain cases. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the game's stability within this framework. We provide tight bounds that specify for which peak values equilibria exist across different dynamics on cycles and binary trees. On arbitrary graphs, in a setting where agents lack information about the selection of other agents, we provide tight bounds for the existence of equilibria, given that the utility function is linear on both sides of the peak. Agents possessing this information on arbitrary graphs creates the sole case where our bounds are not tight, instead, we narrow down the cases in which the game may admit equilibria and present how several conventional approaches fall short in proving stability.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Unsolvability in Roommates Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the well-studied Stable Roommates problem, we seek a stable matching of agents into pairs, where no two agents prefer each other over their assigned partners. However, some instances of this problem are unsolvable, lacking any stable matching. A long-standing open question posed by Gusfield and Irving (1989) asks about the behavior of the probability function Pn, which measures the likelihood that a random instance with n agents is solvable.
  This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the landscape surrounding this question, combining structural, probabilistic, and experimental perspectives. We review existing approaches from the past four decades, highlight connections to related problems, and present novel structural and experimental findings. Specifically, we estimate Pn for instances with preferences sampled from diverse statistical distributions, examining problem sizes up to 5,001 agents, and look for specific sub-structures that cause unsolvability. Our results reveal that while Pn tends to be low for most distributions, the number and lengths of "unstable" structures remain limited, suggesting that random instances are "close" to being solvable.
  Additionally, we present the first empirical study of the number of stable matchings and the number of stable partitions that random instances admit, using recently developed algorithms. Our findings show that the solution sets are typically small. This implies that many NP-hard problems related to computing optimal stable matchings and optimal stable partitions become tractable in practice, and motivates efficient alternative solution concepts for unsolvable instances, such as stable half-matchings and maximum stable matchings.</description>

      <title>Constant-Memory Strategies in Stochastic Games: Best Responses and Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Here is a short version, see our paper for the complete abstract.)
  In this work, we comprehensively investigate the concept of constant-memory strategies in stochastic games. We first establish some results on best responses and Nash equilibria for behavioral constant-memory strategies, followed by a discussion on the computational hardness of best responding to mixed constant-memory strategies. Those theoretic insights later empower a generative framework for studying generalizability of single-agent RL algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Pure Strategy Relevant Equilibria in Concurrent Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rational synthesis problems for concurrent games with $\omega$-regular objectives. Our model of rationality considers only pure strategy Nash equilibria that satisfy either a social welfare or Pareto optimality condition with respect to an $\omega$-regular objective for each agent. This extends earlier work on equilibria in concurrent games, without consideration about their quality. Our results show that the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying social welfare conditions can be computed as efficiently as the constrained Nash equilibrium existence problem. On the other hand, the existence of Nash equilibria satisfying the Pareto optimality condition possibly involves a higher upper bound, except in the case of B\"uchi and Muller games, for which all three problems are in the classes P and PSPACE-complete, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rental Games with Stagewise Individual Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study \emph{rental games} -- a single-parameter dynamic mechanism design problem, in which a designer rents out an indivisible asset over $n$ days. Each day, an agent arrives with a private valuation per day of rental, drawn from that day's (known) distribution. The designer can either rent out the asset to the current agent for any number of remaining days, charging them a (possibly different) payment per day, or turn the agent away. Agents who arrive when the asset is not available are turned away. A defining feature of our dynamic model is that agents are \emph{stagewise-IR} (individually rational), meaning they reject any rental agreement that results in temporary negative utility, even if their final utility is positive. We ask whether and under which economic objectives it is useful for the designer to exploit the stagewise-IR nature of the agents.
  We show that an optimal rental mechanism can be modeled as a sequence of dynamic auctions with seller costs. However, the stagewise-IR behavior of the agents makes these auctions quite different from classical single-parameter auctions: Myerson's Lemma does not apply, and indeed we show that truthful mechanisms are not necessarily monotone, and payments do not necessarily follow Myerson's unique payment rule. We develop alternative characterizations of optimal mechanisms under several classes of economic objectives, including generalizations of welfare, revenue and consumer surplus. These characterizations allow us to use Myerson's unique payment rule in several cases, and for the other cases we develop optimal mechanisms from scratch. Our work shows that rental games raise interesting questions even in the single-parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Data Game: Characterizing the Model Competition Across Multiple Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data heterogeneity across multiple sources is common in real-world machine learning (ML) settings. Although many methods focus on enabling a single model to handle diverse data, real-world markets often comprise multiple competing ML providers. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework -- the Heterogeneous Data Game -- to analyze how such providers compete across heterogeneous data sources. We investigate the resulting pure Nash equilibria (PNE), showing that they can be non-existent, homogeneous (all providers converge on the same model), or heterogeneous (providers specialize in distinct data sources). Our analysis spans monopolistic, duopolistic, and more general markets, illustrating how factors such as the "temperature" of data-source choice models and the dominance of certain data sources shape equilibrium outcomes. We offer theoretical insights into both homogeneous and heterogeneous PNEs, guiding regulatory policies and practical strategies for competitive ML marketplaces.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Game-Theoretic Resource Allocation on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic resource allocation on graphs (GRAG) involves two players competing over multiple steps to control nodes of interest on a graph, a problem modeled as a multi-step Colonel Blotto Game (MCBG). Finding optimal strategies is challenging due to the dynamic action space and structural constraints imposed by the graph. To address this, we formulate the MCBG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, specifically Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To enforce graph constraints, we introduce an action-displacement adjacency matrix that dynamically generates valid action sets at each step. We evaluate RL performance across a variety of graph structures and initial resource distributions, comparing against random, greedy, and learned RL policies. Experimental results show that both DQN and PPO consistently outperform baseline strategies and converge to a balanced $50\%$ win rate when competing against the learned RL policy. Particularly, on asymmetric graphs, RL agents successfully exploit structural advantages and adapt their allocation strategies, even under disadvantageous initial resource distributions.</description>

Abstract: We study the safety problem for the next-generation access control (NGAC) model. We show that under mild assumptions it is coNP-complete, and under further realistic assumptions we give an algorithm for the safety problem that significantly outperforms naive brute force search. We also show that real-world examples of mutually exclusive attributes lead to nearly worst-case behavior of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Price Equilibria in a Spatial Competition with Captive Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores price competition with exogenous product differentiation in a spatial model similar to that of Nakagawa (2023). Nakagawa examines product differentiation within the framework of Varian (1980). Nakagawa integrates Varian's concept of uninformed consumers, who lack complete price information, into a spatial model based on Hotelling (1929). While Nakagawa placed informed consumers at the center of the Hotelling line and used quadratic transportation costs, our study employs a uniform distribution of informed consumers and linear transportation costs. This approach enables a more direct comparison with established spatial competition literature, particularly Osborne and Pitchik (1987). We classify equilibrium candidates and characterize the parameter regions corresponding to each equilibrium. There is no pure equilibrium in the region where we construct mixed strategy equilibria. Furthermore, we compare the expected profit in the equilibrium of our model with the findings of Osborne and Pitchik (1987). Finally, we discuss the impact of captive buyers on the nature of spatial competition.</description>

      <title>More Than Opinions: The Role of Values in Shaping Fairness and Status in the Ultimatum Game within Structured Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric evolutionary games, such as the Ultimatum Game, provide keys to understanding the emergence of fairness in social species. Building on this framework, we explore the evolution of social value systems and the operational role that social status plays in hierarchically organised societies. Within the asymmetric Ultimatum Game paradigm, where "proposers" suggest terms for resource distribution, and "responders" accept or reject these terms, we examine the assignment of roles between players under a subjective social order. This order is grounded in an emergent status hierarchy based on observable player attributes (such as age and wealth). The underlying rules for constructing such a hierarchy stabilise over time by inheritance and family ties. Despite their subjective nature these (often sub-conscious) value systems have operative meaning in controlling access of individuals to resources and decision making. We demonstrate these effects using a simple but sufficiently complex model with dynamical population size and network structure, where division of resources (prey) is carried out according to the principles of the Ultimatum Game. We focus on the emerging proposer and responder thresholds under distinct social hierarchies and interaction networks and discuss them in relation to the extensive body of Ultimatum Game experiments conducted across a wide range of cultural contexts. We observe the emergence of diverse sharing norms, ranging from unfair to highly generous, alongside the development of various social norms.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg vs. Nash in the Lottery Colonel Blotto Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resource competition problems are often modeled using Colonel Blotto games, where players take simultaneous actions. However, many real-world scenarios involve sequential decision-making rather than simultaneous moves.
  To model these dynamics, we represent the Lottery Colonel Blotto game as a Stackelberg game, in which one player, the leader, commits to a strategy first, and the other player, the follower, responds. We derive the Stackelberg equilibrium for this game, formulating the leader's strategy as a bi-level optimization problem.
  To solve this, we develop a constructive method based on iterative game reductions, which allows us to efficiently compute the leader's optimal commitment strategy in polynomial time. Additionally, we identify the conditions under which the Stackelberg equilibrium coincides with the Nash equilibrium. Specifically, this occurs when the budget ratio between the leader and the follower equals a certain threshold, which we can calculate in closed form. In some instances, we observe that when the leader's budget exceeds this threshold, both players achieve higher utilities in the Stackelberg equilibrium compared to the Nash equilibrium. Lastly, we show that, in the best case, the leader can achieve an infinite utility improvement by making an optimal first move compared to the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On the existence of pure epsilon-equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, as the number of agents gets large, the share of games that admit a pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium converges to 1. Our result holds even for pure $\epsilon$-equilibria in which all agents, except for at most one, play a best response. In contrast, it is known that the share of games that admit a pure Nash equilibrium, that is for $\epsilon=0$, is asymptotically $1-1/e\approx 0.63$. This suggests that very small deviations from perfect rationality, captured by positive values of $\epsilon$, suffice to ensure the general existence of stable outcomes. We also study the existence of pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium when the number of actions gets large. Our proofs rely on the probabilistic method and the Chen-Stein method.</description>

      <title>Static and Repeated Cooperative Games for the Optimization of the AoI in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing and the internet of things (IoT) are nowadays pervasive in 5G and beyond networks, and they are expected to play a crucial role in 6G. However, a centralized optimization of a distributed system is not always possible and cost-efficient. In this paper, we analyze a setting in which two sensors collaboratively update a common server seeking to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the latest sample of a common physical process. We consider a distributed and uncoordinated setting where each sensor lacks information about whether the other decides to update the server. This strategic setting is modeled through game theory (GT) and two games are defined: i) a static game of complete information with an incentive mechanism for cooperation, and ii) a repeated game over a finite horizon where the static game is played at each stage. We perform a mathematical analysis of the static game finding three Nash Equilibria (NEs) in pure strategies and one in mixed strategies. A numerical simulation of the repeated game is also presented and novel and valuable insight into the setting is given thanks to the definition of a new metric, the price of delayed updates (PoDU), which shows that the decentralized solution provides results close to the centralized optimum.</description>
