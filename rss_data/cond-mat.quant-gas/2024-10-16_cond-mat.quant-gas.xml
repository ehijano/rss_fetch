      <title>Symmetry aspects in an ideal Bose gas at thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of ideal gases is supplemented by a numerical quantum field description with a two-dimensional non-local order parameter that allows the modeling of wave-like atomic correlations and interference effects in the limit of low atomic densities. From the present model, it is possible to explain certain new fundamental symmetry aspects of ideal and very weakly interacting Bose gases, like the forward propagation of time and the relation to the breaking and preservation of phase gauge symmetry in solids. In the present formalism, the propagation of one-directional time arises from the pre-defined and equivalent convergence of independent quantum fields towards the Boltzmann equilibrium, and it is shown that Glauber's coherent states are related to the definition of the quantized field. As a direct consequence of thermal equilibrium, the present model describes spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is originally known only from the formal definition of a specific gauge field from Elizur's theorem for local gauge fields, as a continuous physical rather than a purely formal mathematical process.</description>

      <title>Stochastic model for assesing coherent properties of polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering a microscopical model, we derive an evolution equation for single-mode polariton condensate taking into account the fluctuations of the order parameter. We use it to derive an analytical expression for the second order correlation function and the share of coherent occupation of the condensate in presence of pumping-leakage balance.</description>

      <title>Conditional atomic cat state generation via superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, each experimental realization of a dynamical quantum system may yield a different measurement outcome, especially when the system is coupled to an environment that causes dissipation. Although it is in principle possible that some quantum trajectories lead to exotic highly entangled quantum states, the probability of observing these trajectories is usually extremely low. In this work, we show how to maximize the probability of generating highly entangled states, including maximally entangled cat states, in an ensemble of atoms experiencing superradiant decay. To this end, we analyze an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which governs the dynamics between the quantum jumps associated with photon emission. A key result of our study is that, in order to maximally enhance the probability of cat state generation, the initial state needs to be non-classical. This can be achieved e.g. with one-axis twisting in a cavity-QED system.</description>

      <title>Engineering impurity Bell states through coupling with a quantum bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of creating Bell states in multi-component ultra-cold atomic gases by solely using the ability to control the inter-particle interactions via Feshbach resonances. For this we consider two distinguishable impurities immersed in an atomic background cloud of a few bosons, with the entire system being confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. By analyzing the numerically obtained ground states we demonstrate that the two impurities can form spatially entangled bipolaron states due to mediated interactions from the bosonic bath. Our analysis is based on calculating the correlations between the two impurities in a two-mode basis, which is experimentally accessible by measuring the particles positions in the left or right sides of the trap. While interspecies interactions are crucial in order to create the strongly entangled impurity states, it can also inhibit correlations depending on the ordering of the impurities and three-body impurity-bath correlations. We show how these drawbacks can be mitigated by manipulating the properties of the bath, namely its size, mass and intraspecies interactions, allowing to create impurity Bell states over a wide range of impurity-impurity interactions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of total phase fluctuation in cold-atomic quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. Here we extend this approach to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two 1D Bose gases probed by interference. Our analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes: Development of a minimal model for pulsar glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that allows us to explore the coupled motion of neutron-superfluid vortices and proton-superconductor flux tubes in a gravitationally collapsed condensate, which describe neutron stars that form pulsars. Our framework uses the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson-Equation (GPPE) for neutron Cooper pairs, the Real-Time-Ginzburg-Landau equation (RTGLE) for proton Cooper pairs, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and Newtonian gravity and interactions, both direct and induced by the Poisson equation, between the neutron and proton subsystems. For a pulsar we include a crust potential, characterized by an angle $\theta$, and frictional drag. By carrying out extensive direct numerical simulations, we obtain a variety of interesting results. We show that a rotating proton superconductor generates a uniform London magnetic field, which changes the field distribution inside flux tubes. In the absence of any direct interaction between the two species, they interact through the gravitational Poisson equation. The presence of attractive (repulsive) density-density interaction leads to the attraction (repulsion) between neutron vortices and proton flux tubes. The inclusion of the current-current interaction and the complete Maxwell equations allows us to quantify the entrainment effect that leads to induced magnetization of neutron vortices. We show that, with a strong external magnetic field ${\bf B}_{\rm ext}$, proton flux tubes are anchored to the crust, whereas neutron vortices leave the condensate and lead to abrupt changes of the crust angular momentum ${\rm J}_c$. The frictional term in the dynamical equation for $\theta$ yields stick-slip dynamics that leads, in turn, to glitches in the time series of ${\rm J}_c$. By calculating various statistical properties of this time series, we demonstrate that they display self-organised criticality(SOC).</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>
