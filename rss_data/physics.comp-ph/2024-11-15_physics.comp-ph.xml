      <title>A Message Passing Neural Network Surrogate Model for Bond-Associated Peridynamic Material Correspondence Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peridynamics is a non-local continuum mechanics theory that offers unique advantages for modeling problems involving discontinuities and complex deformations. Within the peridynamic framework, various formulations exist, among which the material correspondence formulation stands out for its ability to directly incorporate traditional continuum material models, making it highly applicable to a range of engineering challenges. A notable advancement in this area is the bond-associated correspondence model, which not only resolves issues of material instability but also achieves high computational accuracy. However, the bond-associated model typically requires higher computational costs than FEA, which can limit its practical application. To address this computational challenge, we propose a novel surrogate model based on a message-passing neural network (MPNN) specifically designed for the bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence formulation. Leveraging the similarities between graph structure and the neighborhood connectivity inherent to peridynamics, we construct an MPNN that can transfers domain knowledge from peridynamics into a computational graph and shorten the computation time via GPU acceleration. Unlike conventional graph neural networks that focus on node features, our model emphasizes edge-based features, capturing the essential material point interactions in the formulation. A key advantage of this neural network approach is its flexibility: it does not require fixed neighborhood connectivity, making it adaptable across diverse configurations and scalable for complex systems. Furthermore, the model inherently possesses translational and rotational invariance, enabling it to maintain physical objectivity: a critical requirement for accurate mechanical modeling.</description>

      <title>A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with predefined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. In this paper, we introduce a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create a restraining potential "cliff" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a predefined area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Pheromone-Guided Navigation of Potential Mates: A Distinct Exploration Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals, especially insects, navigate their environments using complex strategies that integrate responses to chemical signals such as pheromones. The relative importance an insect places on foraging, finding a mate or other tasks can significantly influence its movement patterns. This study uncovers the distinct exploration strategies that emerge when these priorities vary. A new model is introduced that explicitly treats a pair of insects and their response to each other's pheromones. The strategy results in dynamics that exhibit characteristic anomalous scaling in displacement and non-Gaussian distributions of position; specifically, compressed exponential distributions for the number of encounters and the total duration of encounters. Our model not only elucidates these emergent behaviours but also provides insight into optimizing encounter frequencies. These strategies can be inverted to design pheromone-based traps for luring target species to specific areas for removal. The model is also applicable more broadly to pairs of agents that both respond to the paths traced by themselves and each other.</description>

      <title>Computational metaoptics for imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces -- ultrathin structures composed of subwavelength optical elements -- have revolutionized light manipulation by enabling precise control over electromagnetic waves' amplitude, phase, polarization, and spectral properties. Concurrently, computational imaging leverages algorithms to reconstruct images from optically processed signals, overcoming limitations of traditional imaging systems. This review explores the synergistic integration of metaoptics and computational imaging, "computational metaoptics," which combines the physical wavefront shaping ability of metasurfaces with advanced computational algorithms to enhance imaging performance beyond conventional limits. We discuss how computational metaoptics addresses the inherent limitations of single-layer metasurfaces in achieving multifunctionality without compromising efficiency. By treating metasurfaces as physical preconditioners and co-designing them with reconstruction algorithms through end-to-end (inverse) design, it is possible to jointly optimize the optical hardware and computational software. This holistic approach allows for the automatic discovery of optimal metasurface designs and reconstruction methods that significantly improve imaging capabilities. Advanced applications enabled by computational metaoptics are highlighted, including phase imaging and quantum state measurement, which benefit from the metasurfaces' ability to manipulate complex light fields and the computational algorithms' capacity to reconstruct high-dimensional information. We also examine performance evaluation challenges, emphasizing the need for new metrics that account for the combined optical and computational nature of these systems. Finally, we identify new frontiers in computational metaoptics which point toward a future where computational metaoptics may play a central role in advancing imaging science and technology.</description>

      <title>A machine learning enhanced discontinuous Galerkin method for simulating transonic airfoil flow-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and rapid prediction of flow-fields is crucial for aerodynamic design. This work proposes a discontinuous Galerkin method (DGM) whose performance enhances with increasing data, for rapid simulation of transonic flow around airfoils under various flow conditions. A lightweight and continuously updated data-driven model is built offline to predict the roughly correct flow-field, and the DGM is then utilized to refine the detailed flow structures and provide the corrected data. During the construction of the data-driven model, a zonal proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is designed to reduce the dimensionality of flow-field while preserving more near-wall flow features, and a weighted-distance radial basis function (RBF) is constructed to enhance the generalization capability of flow-field prediction. Numerical results demonstrate that the lightweight data-driven model can predict the flow-field around a wide range of airfoils at Mach numbers ranging from 0.7 to 0.95 and angles of attack from -5 to 5 degrees by learning from sparse data, and maintains high accuracy of the location and essential features of flow structures (such as shock waves). In addition, the machine learning (ML) enhanced DGM is able to significantly improve the computational efficiency and simulation robustness as compared to normal DGMs in simulating transonic inviscid/viscous airfoil flow-fields on arbitrary grids, and further enables rapid aerodynamic evaluation of numerous sample points during the surrogate-based aerodynamic optimization.</description>

      <title>Enhanced HLLEM and HLL-CPS schemes for all Mach number flows based using anti-diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compares the HLLEM and HLL-CPS schemes for Euler equations and proposes improvements for all Mach number flows. Enhancements to the HLLEM scheme involve adding anti-diffusion terms in the face normal direction and modifying anti-diffusion coefficients for linearly degenerate waves near shocks. The HLL-CPS scheme is improved by adjusting anti-diffusion coefficients for the face normal direction and linearly degenerate waves. Matrix stability, linear perturbation, and asymptotic analyses demonstrate the robustness of the proposed schemes and their ability to capture low Mach flow features. Numerical tests confirm that the schemes are free from shock instabilities at high speeds and accurately resolve low Mach number flow features.</description>

      <title>A Sylvester equation approach for the computation of zero-group-velocity points in waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenvalues of parameter-dependent quadratic eigenvalue problems form eigencurves. The critical points on these curves, where the derivative vanishes, are of practical interest.
  A particular example is found in the dispersion curves of elastic waveguides, where such points are called zero-group-velocity (ZGV) points. Recently, it was revealed that the problem of computing ZGV points can be modeled as a multiparameter eigenvalue problem (MEP), and several numerical methods were devised. Due to their complexity, these methods are feasible only for problems involving small matrices. In this paper, we improve the efficiency of these methods by exploiting the link to the Sylvester equation. This approach enables the computation of ZGV points for problems with much larger matrices, such as multi-layered plates and three-dimensional structures of complex cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond Exact Solutions on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can be used as a simulator capable of predicting properties of diverse quantum systems. Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a quantum computer with a Heron superconducting processor. We simulate the N$_2$ triple bond breaking in a correlation-consistent cc-pVDZ basis set, and the active-space electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, using 58, 45 and 77 qubits respectively, with quantum circuits of up to 10570 (3590 2-qubit) quantum gates. We obtain our results using a class of quantum circuits that approximates molecular eigenstates, and a hybrid estimator. The estimator processes quantum samples, produces upper bounds to the ground-state energy and wavefunctions supported on a polynomial number of states. This guarantees an unconditional quality metric for quantum advantage, certifiable by classical computers at polynomial cost. For current error rates, our results show that classical distributed computing coupled to quantum computers can produce good approximate solutions for practical problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Predicting electronic screening for fast Koopmans spectral functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Koopmans spectral functionals are a powerful extension of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) that enable the prediction of spectral properties with state-of-the-art accuracy. The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties. More broadly, this work demonstrates that measuring violations of piecewise linearity (i.e. curvature in total energies with respect to occupancies) can be done efficiently by combining frozen-orbital approximations and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the checkerboard problem to reduce numerical dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive exploration of various methods in solving incompressible flows using a projection method, and their relation to the occurrence and management of checkerboard oscillations. It employs an algebraic symmetry-preserving framework, clarifying the derivation and implementation of discrete operators while also addressing the associated numerical errors. The lack of a proper definition for the checkerboard problem is addressed by proposing a physics-based coefficient. This coefficient, rooted in the disparity between the compact- and wide-stencil Laplacian operators, is able to quantify oscillatory solution fields with a physics-based, global, normalised, non-dimensional value. The influence of mesh and time-step refinement on the occurrence of checkerboarding is highlighted. Therefore, single measurements using this coefficient should be considered with caution, as the value presents little use without any context and can either suggest mesh refinement or use of a different solver. In addition, an example is given on how to employ this coefficient, by establishing a negative feedback between the level of checkerboarding and the inclusion of a pressure predictor, to dynamically balance the checkerboarding and numerical dissipation. This method is tested for laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating its capabilities in obtaining this dynamical balance, without requiring user input. The method is able to achieve low numerical dissipation in absence of oscillations or diminish oscillation on skew meshes, while it shows minimal loss in accuracy for a turbulent test case. Despite its advantages, the method exhibits a slight decrease in the second-order relation between time-step size and pressure error, suggesting that other feedback mechanisms could be of interest.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of matrix-product-state representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>
