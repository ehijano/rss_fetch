      <title>Optimal Trajectories in Discrete Space with Acceleration Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the racetrack acceleration model, proposed by Martin Gardner in 1973, each step consists of changing the position of the vehicle by a vector in $\mathbb{Z}^2$, with the constraints that two consecutive vectors differ by at most one unit in each dimension. We investigate three problems related to this model in arbitrary dimension in open space (no obstacles), where a configuration of the vehicle consists of its current position and the last-used vector. The three problems are the following. In Branching Cost (BC), given two configurations, the goal is to compute the minimum number of intermediate configurations (length of a trajectory) between the two configurations. Branching Trajectory (BT) has the same input and asks for a description of the corresponding trajectory. Multipoint Trajectory (MT) asks for an optimal trajectory that visits given points $p_1,\dots,p_n$ in a prescribed order, starting and ending with zero-speed configurations.\\ We revisit known approaches to solve BC in 2D, showing that this problem can be solved in constant time in any fixed number of dimensions $d$ (more generally, in $O(d \log d)$ time). We show that BT can also be solved in constant time for any fixed $d$, despite the fact that the length of the trajectory is not constant, by leveraging the fact that there always exists \emph{one} optimal trajectory compactly represented by $O(1)$ intermediate configurations. For MT, we collect theoretical and experimental evidence that the speed cannot be trivially bounded; local decisions may be impacted by points that are arbitrarily far in the visit order; and an optimal trajectory may require significant excursions out of the convex hull of the points. We still establish conservative speed bounds that a natural dynamic programming (DP) algorithm can exploit to solve reasonably large instances efficiently.</description>

      <title>(Semi-)Invariant Curves from Centers of Triangle Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study curves obtained by tracing triangle centers within special families of triangles, focusing on centers and families that yield (semi-)invariant triangle curves, meaning that varying the initial triangle changes the loci only by an affine transformation. We identify four two-parameter families of triangle centers that are semi-invariant and determine which are invariant, in the sense that the resulting curves for different initial triangles are related by a similarity transformation. We further observe that these centers, when combined with the aliquot triangle family, yield sheared Maclaurin trisectrices, whereas the nedian triangle family yields Lima\c{c}on trisectrices.</description>

      <title>Singular Arrange and Traverse Algorithm for Computing Reeb Spaces of Bivariate PL Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact and efficient algorithm for computing the Reeb space of a bivariate PL map. The Reeb space is a topological structure that generalizes the Reeb graph to the setting of multiple scalar-valued functions defined over a shared domain, a situation that frequently arises in practical applications. While the Reeb graph has become a standard tool in computer graphics, shape analysis, and scientific visualization, the Reeb space is still in the early stages of adoption. Although several algorithms for computing the Reeb space have been proposed, none offer an implementation that is both exact and efficient, which has substantially limited its practical use. To address this gap, we introduce singular arrange and traverse, a new algorithm built upon the arrange and traverse framework. Our method exploits the fact that, in the bivariate case, only singular edges contribute to the structure of Reeb space, allowing us to ignore many regular edges. This observation results in substantial efficiency gains on datasets where most edges are regular, which is common in many numerical simulations of physical systems. We provide an implementation of our method and benchmark it against the original arrange and traverse algorithm, showing performance gains of up to four orders of magnitude on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Morton-Type Space-Filling Curve for Pyramid Subdivision and Hybrid Adaptive Mesh Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The forest-of-refinement-trees approach allows for dynamic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) at negligible cost. While originally developed for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, previous work established the theory and algorithms for unstructured meshes of simplicial and prismatic elements. To harness the full potential of tree-based AMR for three-dimensional mixed-element meshes, this paper introduces the pyramid as a new functional element type; its primary purpose is to connect tetrahedral and hexahedral elements without hanging edges. We present a well-defined space-filling curve (SFC) for the pyramid and detail how the unique challenges on the element and forest level associated with the pyramidal refinement are resolved. We propose the necessary functional design and generalize the fundamental global parallel algorithms for refinement, coarsening, partitioning, and face ghost exchange to fully support this new element. Our demonstrations confirm the efficiency and scalability of this complete, hybrid-element dynamic AMR framework.</description>
