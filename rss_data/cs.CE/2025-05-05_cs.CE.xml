      <title>Transforming physics-informed machine learning to convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order structure-property linkages for stochastic metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of additive manufacturing have facilitated the design and production of mechanical metamaterials with diverse unit cell geometries. Establishing linkages between the vast design space of unit cells and their effective mechanical properties is critical for the efficient design and performance evaluation of such metamaterials. However, physics-based simulations of metamaterial unit cells across the entire design space are computationally expensive, necessitating a materials informatics framework to efficiently capture complex structure-property relationships. In this work, principal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to extract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D metamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the homogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs. Subsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order surrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic constant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value low-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial dataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps. Finally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to the original full dataset. It is shown that a dataset as small as $0.61\%$ of the entire dataset is sufficient to generate accurate and robust structure-property maps.</description>

      <title>SimICD: A Closed-Loop Simulation Framework For ICD Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual studies of ICD behaviour are crucial for testing device functionality in a controlled environment prior to clinical application. Although previous works have shown the viability of using in silico testing for diagnosis, there is a notable gap in available models that can simulate therapy progression decisions during arrhythmic episodes. This work introduces SimICD, a simulation tool which combines virtual ICD logic algorithms with cardiac electrophysiology simulations in a feedback loop, allowing the progression of ICD therapy protocols to be simulated for a range of tachy-arrhythmia episodes. Using a cohort of virtual patients, we demonstrate the ability of SimICD to simulate realistic cardiac signals and ICD responses that align with the logic of real-world devices, facilitating the reprogramming of ICD parameters to adapt to specific episodes.</description>

      <title>Design for a Digital Twin in Clinical Patient Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twins hold great potential to personalize clinical patient care, provided the concept is translated to meet specific requirements dictated by established clinical workflows. We present a generalizable Digital Twin design combining knowledge graphs and ensemble learning to reflect the entire patient's clinical journey and assist clinicians in their decision-making. Such Digital Twins can be predictive, modular, evolving, informed, interpretable and explainable with applications ranging from oncology to epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Prismatic: Interactive Multi-View Cluster Analysis of Concept Stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial cluster analysis allows investors to discover investment alternatives and avoid undertaking excessive risks. However, this analytical task faces substantial challenges arising from many pairwise comparisons, the dynamic correlations across time spans, and the ambiguity in deriving implications from business relational knowledge. We propose Prismatic, a visual analytics system that integrates quantitative analysis of historical performance and qualitative analysis of business relational knowledge to cluster correlated businesses interactively. Prismatic features three clustering processes: dynamic cluster generation, knowledge-based cluster exploration, and correlation-based cluster validation. Utilizing a multi-view clustering approach, it enriches data-driven clusters with knowledge-driven similarity, providing a nuanced understanding of business correlations. Through well-coordinated visual views, Prismatic facilitates a comprehensive interpretation of intertwined quantitative and qualitative features, demonstrating its usefulness and effectiveness via case studies on formulating concept stocks and extensive interviews with domain experts.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</description>
