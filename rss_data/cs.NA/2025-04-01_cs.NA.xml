      <title>Continuous data assimilation for problems with limited regularity using non-interpolant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous data assimilation addresses time-dependent problems with unknown initial conditions by incorporating observations of the solution into a nudging term. For the prototypical heat equation with variable conductivity and the Neumann boundary condition, we consider data assimilation schemes with non-interpolant observables unlike previous studies. These generalized nudging strategies are notably useful for problems which possess limited or even no additional regularity beyond the minimal framework. We demonstrate that a spatially discretized nudged solution converges exponentially fast in time to the true solution with the rate guaranteed by the choice of the nudging strategy independent of the discretization. Furthermore, the long-term discrete error is optimal as it matches the estimates available for problems of limited regularity with known initial conditions. Three particular strategies -- nudging by a conforming finite element subspace, nudging by piecewise constants on the boundary mesh, and nudging by the mean value -- are explored numerically for three test cases, including a problem with Dirac delta forcing and the Kellogg problem with discontinuous conductivity.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with functional hierarchical tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel numerical scheme for solving the Fokker-Planck equation of discretized Dean-Kawasaki models with a functional tensor network ansatz. The Dean-Kawasaki model describes density fluctuations of interacting particle systems, and it is a highly singular stochastic partial differential equation. By performing a finite-volume discretization of the Dean-Kawasaki model, we derive a stochastic differential equation (SDE). To fully characterize the discretized Dean-Kawasaki model, we solve the associated Fokker-Planck equation of the SDE dynamics. In particular, we use a particle-based approach whereby the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained by performing a series of density estimation tasks from the simulated trajectories, and we use a functional hierarchical tensor model to represent the density. To address the challenge that the sample trajectories are supported on a simplex, we apply a coordinate transformation from the simplex to a Euclidean space by logarithmic parameterization, after which we apply a sketching-based density estimation procedure on the transformed variables. Our approach is general and can be applied to general density estimation tasks over a simplex. We apply the proposed method successfully to the 1D and 2D Dean-Kawasaki models. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach is highly accurate in the presence of external potential and particle interaction.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Variable Resultant Method for the Polynomial Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, global algorithm for solving polynomial multiparameter eigenvalue problems (PMEPs) by leveraging a hidden variable tensor Dixon resultant framework. Our method transforms a PMEP into one or more univariate polynomial eigenvalue problems, which are solved as generalized eigenvalue problems. Our general approach avoids the need for custom linearizations of PMEPs. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for generic PMEPs and give practical strategies for nongeneric systems. Benchmarking on applications from aeroelastic flutter and leaky wave propagation confirms that our algorithm attains high accuracy and robustness while being broadly applicable to many PMEPs.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation Models for Computing Probability Distributions of Complex Multiscale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a data assimilation strategy aimed at accurately capturing key non-Gaussian structures in probability distributions using a small ensemble size. A major challenge in statistical forecasting of nonlinearly coupled multiscale systems is mitigating the large errors that arise when computing high-order statistical moments. To address this issue, a high-order stochastic-statistical modeling framework is proposed that integrates statistical data assimilation into finite ensemble predictions. The method effectively reduces the approximation errors in finite ensemble estimates of non-Gaussian distributions by employing a filtering update step that incorporates observation data in leading moments to refine the high-order statistical feedback. Explicit filter operators are derived from intrinsic nonlinear coupling structures, allowing straightforward numerical implementations. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through extensive numerical experiments on a prototype triad system. The triad system offers an instructive and computationally manageable platform mimicking essential aspects of nonlinear turbulent dynamics. The numerical results show that the statistical data assimilation algorithm consistently captures the mean and covariance, as well as various non-Gaussian probability distributions exhibited in different statistical regimes of the triad system. The modeling framework can serve as a useful tool for efficient sampling and reliable forecasting of complex probability distributions commonly encountered in a wide variety of applications involving multiscale coupling and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stable fully discrete finite element methods with BGN tangential motion for Willmore flow of planar curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze stable finite element approximations for Willmore flow of planar curves. The presented schemes are based on a novel weak formulation which combines an evolution equation for curvature with the curvature formulation originally proposed by Barrett, Garcke and N\"urnberg (BGN) in \cite{BGN07}. Under discretization in space with piecewise linear elements this leads to a stable continuous-in-time semidiscrete scheme, which retains the equidistribution property from the BGN methods. Furthermore, two fully discrete schemes can be shown to satisfy unconditional energy stability estimates. Numerical examples are presented to showcase the good properties of the introduced schemes, including an asymptotic equidistribution of vertices.</description>

      <title>A Novel Transformed Fibered Rank Approximation with Total Variation Regularization for Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, tensor fibered rank has demonstrated impressive performance by effectively leveraging the global low-rank property in all directions for low-rank tensor completion (LRTC). However, it still has some limitations. Firstly, the typical tensor fibered rank approximation based on tensor nuclear norm (TNN) processes fixed and data-independent transformation, which may not be optimal for the underlying tensor structure. Secondly, it ignores the local piecewise smoothness of the dataset. To address these limitations, we present a nonconvex learnable transformed fibered nuclear norm (NLTFNN) model for LRTC,which uses a learnable transformed fibered nuclear norm with Log-Determinant (LTFNNLog) as tensor fibered rank approximation, and employs a total variation (TV) regularization to explore local piecewise smoothness. An efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to solve NLTFNN and the convergence of the algorithm is proved theoretically. Experiments on various datasets show the superiority of NLTFNN over several existing methods.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable shock capturing for high-order DGSEM on moving meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a shock capturing for high-order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods on moving meshes is proposed using Gauss--Lobatto nodes. The shock capturing is achieved via the convex blending of the high-order scheme with a low-order finite volume subcell operator. The free-stream and convergence properties of the hybrid scheme are demonstrated numerically along with the entropy stability and shock capturing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Robust superconvergence analysis of physics-preserving RMAC scheme for the Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations on non-uniform grids at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity errors of the classical marker and cell (MAC) scheme are dependent on the pressure approximation errors, which is non-pressure-robust and will cause the accuracy of the velocity approximation to deteriorate when the pressure approximation is poor. In this paper, we first propose the reconstructed MAC scheme (RMAC) based on the finite volume method to obtain the pressure-robustness for the time-dependent Stokes equations and then construct the $\mu$-robust and physics-preserving RMAC scheme on non-uniform grids for the Navier--Stokes equations, where $\mu$-robustness means that the velocity errors do not blow up for small viscosity $\mu$ when the true velocity is sufficiently smooth. Compared with the original MAC scheme, which was analyzed in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 55 (2017): 1135-1158], the RMAC scheme is different only on the right-hand side for Stokes equations. It can also be proved that the constructed scheme satisfies the local mass conservation law, the discrete unconditional energy dissipation law, the momentum conservation, and the angular momentum conservation for the Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations. Furthermore, by constructing the new auxiliary function depending on the velocity and using the high-order consistency analysis, we can obtain the pressure-robust and $\mu$-robust error estimates for the velocity and derive the second-order superconvergence for the velocity and pressure in the discrete $l^{\infty}(l^2)$ norm on non-uniform grids and the discrete $l^{\infty}(l^{\infty})$ norm on uniform grids. Finally, numerical experiments using the constructed schemes are demonstrated to show the robustness for our constructed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formulation of the 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear in the rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation is considered. This novel approach provides the first asymptotically accurate and inherently locking-free finite element implementation. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells demonstrate excellent agreement between the analytical solution, the 2D refined shell theory, and three-dimensional elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical scheme for solving a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard type equation that captures the dynamics of phase transitions in a ternary mixture consisting of two immiscible fluids and a surface active molecule that is amphiphilic. We show that by considering a suitable midpoint approximation for the nonlinear terms in the differential equation, we obtain an unconditionally energy-stable numerical scheme that is second-order in time. We demonstrate that our proposed numerical scheme satisfies these key properties for a wide range of physical parameters in two and three dimensions. Moreover, we present the results of a numerical study to report on the impact of each physical parameter on the behavior of the dynamics of the phase transitions, which are in agreement with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for a Time-Fractional HIV Model with Nonlinear Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates an inverse problem associated with a time-fractional HIV infection model incorporating nonlinear diffusion. The model describes the dynamics of uninfected target cells, infected cells, and free virus particles, where the diffusion terms are nonlinear density functions. The primary objective is to recover the unknown diffusion functions by utilizing final-time measurement data. Due to the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem and the presence of measurement noise, we employ a Bayesian inference framework to obtain stable and reliable estimates while quantifying uncertainty. To solve the inverse problem efficiently, we develop an Iterative Regularizing Ensemble Kalman Method (IREKM), which enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple diffusion terms without requiring gradient information. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing the unknown diffusion terms under different noise levels, demonstrating its robustness and accuracy. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of HIV infection dynamics and provide a computational approach for parameter estimation in fractional diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Integral regularization PINNs for evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution equations, including both ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs), play a pivotal role in modeling dynamic systems. However, achieving accurate long-time integration for these equations remains a significant challenge. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free framework for solving PDEs, they often suffer from temporal error accumulation, which limits their effectiveness in capturing long-time behaviors. To alleviate this issue, we propose integral regularization PINNs (IR-PINNs), a novel approach that enhances temporal accuracy by incorporating an integral-based residual term into the loss function. This method divides the entire time interval into smaller sub-intervals and enforces constraints over these sub-intervals, thereby improving the resolution and correlation of temporal dynamics. Furthermore, IR-PINNs leverage adaptive sampling to dynamically refine the distribution of collocation points based on the evolving solution, ensuring higher accuracy in regions with sharp gradients or rapid variations. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that IR-PINNs outperform original PINNs and other state-of-the-art methods in capturing long-time behaviors, offering a robust and accurate solution for evolution equations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Calder\'on residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a framework to compute expected convergence rates for residuals based on the Calder\'on identities for general second order differential operators for which fundamental solutions are known. The idea is that these rates could be used to validate implementations of boundary integral operators and allow to test operators separately by choosing solutions where parts of the Calder\'on identities vanish. Our estimates rely on simple vector norms, and thus avoid the use of hard-to-compute norms and the residual computation can be easily implemented in existing boundary element codes. We test the proposed Calder\'on residuals as debugging tool by introducing artificial errors into the Galerkin matrices of some of the boundary integral operators for the Laplacian and time-harmonic Maxwell's equations. From this, we learn that our estimates are not sharp enough to always detect errors, but still provide a simple and useful debugging tool in many situations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a finite volume scheme for a model for ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyse a finite volume scheme for a nonlocal active matter system known to exhibit a rich array of complex behaviours. The model under investigation was derived from a stochastic system of interacting particles describing a foraging ant colony coupled to pheromone dynamics. In this work, we prove that the unique numerical solution converges to the unique weak solution as the mesh size and the time step go to zero. We also show discrete long-time estimates, which prove that certain norms are preserved for all times, uniformly in the mesh size and time step. In particular, we prove higher regularity estimates which provide an analogue of continuum parabolic higher regularity estimates. Finally, we numerically study the rate of convergence of the scheme, and we provide examples of the existence of multiple metastable steady states.</description>

      <title>A simple and general framework for the construction of exactly div-curl-grad compatible discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes on unstructured simplex meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element schemes for the discretization of first order systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) on unstructured simplex meshes in two and three space dimensions that respect the two basic vector calculus identities exactly also at the discrete level, namely that the curl of the gradient is zero and that the divergence of the curl is zero. The key ingredient here is the construction of two compatible discrete nabla operators, a primary one and a dual one, both defined on general unstructured simplex meshes in multiple space dimensions. Our new schemes extend existing cell-centered finite volume methods based on corner fluxes to arbitrary high order of accuracy in space. An important feature of our new method is the fact that only two different discrete function spaces are needed to represent the numerical solution, and the choice of the appropriate function space for each variable is related to the origin and nature of the underlying PDE. The first class of variables is discretized at the aid of a discontinuous Galerkin approach, where the numerical solution is represented via piecewise polynomials of degree N and which are allowed to jump across element interfaces. This set of variables is related to those PDE which are mere consequences of the definitions, derived from some abstract scalar and vector potentials, and for which involutions like the divergence-free or the curl-free property must hold if satisfied by the initial data. The second class of variables is discretized via classical continuous Lagrange finite elements of approximation degree M=N+1 and is related to those PDE which can be derived as the Euler-Lagrange equations of an underlying variational principle.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Inequalities and Optimal Stability of Numerical Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical integrator for $\dot{x}=f(x)$ is called \emph{stable} if, when applied to the 1D Dahlquist test equation $\dot{x}=\lambda x,\lambda\in\mathbb{C}$ with fixed timestep $h&gt;0$, the numerical solution remains bounded as the number of steps tends to infinity. It is well known that no explicit integrator may remain stable beyond certain limits in $\lambda$. Furthermore, these stability limits are only tight for certain specific integrators (different in each case), which may then be called `optimally stable'. Such optimal stability results are typically proven using sophisticated techniques from complex analysis, leading to rather abstruse proofs. In this article, we pursue an alternative approach, exploiting connections with the Bernstein and Markov brothers inequalities for polynomials. This simplifies the proofs greatly and offers a framework which unifies the diverse results that have been obtained.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A Nonlinear Generalization of Linear Inverse Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that construct approximate linear stochastic models to represent complex observational data. The stochastic forcing can be modeled using either Gaussian white noise or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise; the corresponding models are called White-LIM and Colored-LIM, respectively. Although LIMs are widely applied in climate sciences, they inherently approximate observed distributions as Gaussian, limiting their ability to capture asymmetries.
  In this study, we extend LIMs to incorporate nonlinear dynamics, introducing White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM which allow for a more flexible and accurate representation of complex dynamics from observations. The proposed methods not only account for the nonlinear nature of the underlying system but also effectively capture the skewness of the observed distribution. Moreover, we apply these methods to a lower-dimensional representation of ENSO and demonstrate that both White-nLIM and Colored-nLIM successfully capture its nonlinear characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23488v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for approximating continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ by a linear superposition of continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is presented and a polynomial regression model is constructed that allows approximating such functions with any degree of accuracy. A physical interpretation of such a model is given and possible methods for its training are discussed. The proposed model can be considered as a simple alternative to possible $p$-adic models based on neural network architecture.</description>

      <title>On blowup solution in NLS equation under dispersion or nonlinearity management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dispersion-managed nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DM-NLS) equation $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\gamma(t)\Delta u(t,x)=|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x),\quad x\in\R^d, $$ and the nonlinearity-managed NLS (NM-NLS) equation: $$ i\partial_t u(t,x)+\Delta u(t,x)=\gamma(t)|u(t,x)|^{\frac4d}u(t,x), \quad x\in\R^d, $$ where $\gamma(t)$ is a periodic function which is equal to $-1$ when $t\in (0,1]$ and is equal to $1$ when $t\in (1,2]$. The two models share the feature that the focusing and defocusing effects convert periodically. For the classical focusing NLS, it is known that the initial data $$ u_0(x)=T^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4T} -i\frac{\omega^2}{T}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T}\right) $$ leads to a blowup solution $$(T-t)^{-\frac{d}{2}}\fe^{i\frac{|x|^2}{4(T-t)} -i\frac{\omega^2}{T-t}}Q_\omega\left(\frac{x}{T-t}\right), $$ so when $T\leq1$, this is also a blowup solution for DM-NLS and NM-NLS which blows up in the first focusing layer.
  For DM-NLS, we prove that when $T&gt;1$, the initial data $u_0$ above does not lead to a finite-time blowup and the corresponding solution is globally well-posed. For NM-NLS, we prove the global well-posedness for $T\in(1,2)$ and we construct solution that can blow up at any focusing layer. The theoretical studies are complemented by extensive numerical explorations towards understanding the stabilization effects in the two models and addressing their difference.</description>

      <title>Computational Orthodontic Force Simulation: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, the biological response of the tooth, periodontal ligament, and bone complex to orthodontic force is crucial in influencing treatment outcomes. The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and predicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill the gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on orthodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and technologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force simulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement. Studies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and invisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as the predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant focus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics. Current orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering only the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent demand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly leveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of forecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-driven construction of a generalized kinetic collision operator from molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven approach to learn a generalized kinetic collision operator directly from molecular dynamics. Unlike the conventional (e.g., Landau) models, the present operator takes an anisotropic form that accounts for a second energy transfer arising from the collective interactions between the pair of collision particles and the environment. Numerical results show that preserving the broadly overlooked anisotropic nature of the collision energy transfer is crucial for predicting the plasma kinetics with non-negligible correlations, where the Landau model shows limitations.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of discrete models in which a collection of particles evolves in time following the gradient flow of an energy depending on the cell areas of an associated Laguerre (i.e. a weighted Voronoi) tessellation. We consider the high number of cell limit of such systems and, using a modulated energy argument, we prove convergence towards smooth solutions of nonlinear diffusion PDEs of porous medium type.</description>

      <title>The Average and Essential Best Rate of Convergence of the Exact Line Search Gradient Descent Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is very well known that when the exact line search gradient descent method is applied to a convex quadratic objective, the worst-case rate of convergence (ROC), among all seed vectors, deteriorates as the condition number of the Hessian of the objective grows. By an elegant analysis due to H. Akaike, it is generally believed -- but not proved -- that in the ill-conditioned regime the ROC for almost all initial vectors, and hence also the average ROC, is close to the worst case ROC. We complete Akaike's analysis using the theorem of center and stable manifolds. Our analysis also makes apparent the effect of an intermediate eigenvalue in the Hessian by establishing the following somewhat amusing result: In the absence of an intermediate eigenvalue, the average ROC gets arbitrarily \emph{fast} -- not slow -- as the Hessian gets increasingly ill-conditioned.
  We discuss in passing some contemporary applications of exact line search GD to polynomial optimization problems arising from imaging and data sciences. In particular, we observe that a tailored exact line search GD algorithm for a POP arising from the phase retrieval problem is only 50\% more expensive per iteration than its constant step size counterpart, while promising a ROC only matched by the optimally tuned (constant) step size which can almost never be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Numerical Unique Ergodicity of Monotone SDEs driven by Nondegenerate Multiplicative Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01112v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first establish the unique ergodicity of the stochastic theta method (STM) with $\theta \in [1/2, 1]$ for monotone SODEs, without growth restriction on the coefficients, driven by nondegenerate multiplicative noise. The main ingredient of the arguments lies in constructing new Lyapunov functions involving the coefficients, the stepsize, and $\theta$ and deriving a minorization condition for the STM. We then generalize the arguments to the Galerkin-based full discretizations for a class of monotone SPDEs driven by infinite-dimensional nondegenerate multiplicative trace-class noise. Applying these results to the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation indicates that its Galerkin-based full discretizations are uniquely ergodic for any interface thickness. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2305.03945 [math.NA], a first-order optimization algorithm has been introduced to solve time-implicit schemes of reaction-diffusion equations. In this research, we conduct theoretical studies on this first-order algorithm equipped with a quadratic regularization term. We provide sufficient conditions under which the proposed algorithm and its time-continuous limit converge exponentially fast to a desired time-implicit numerical solution. We show both theoretically and numerically that the convergence rate is independent of the grid size, which makes our method suitable for large-scale problems. The efficiency of our algorithm has been verified via a series of numerical examples conducted on various types of reaction-diffusion equations. The choice of optimal hyperparameters as well as comparisons with some classical root-finding algorithms are also discussed in the numerical section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of low-rank tensor-train approximation is well understood when the approximation error is measured in the Frobenius norm. The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured Hanson--Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied by numerical experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex Gaussian quadrature rules for oscillatory integral transforms have the advantage that they can achieve optimal asymptotic order. However, their existence for Hankel transform can only be guaranteed when the order of the transform belongs to $[0,1/2]$. In this paper we consider the construction of generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transform. We show that, if adding certain value and derivative information at the left endpoint, then complex generalized Gauss-Radau quadrature rules for Hankel transform of integer order can be constructed with theoretical guarantees. Orthogonal polynomials that are closely related to such quadrature rules are investigated and their existence for even degrees is proved. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm our findings.</description>

Abstract: We extend a localized model order reduction method for the distributed finite element solution of elliptic boundary value problems in the cloud. We give a computationally efficient technique to compute the required inner product matrices and optimal reduced bases. A memory-efficient methodology is proposed to project the global finite element linear system onto the reduced basis. Our numerical results demonstrate the technique using non-trivial tetrahedral meshes and subdomain interfaces with up to 85 million degrees-of-freedom on a laptop computer by distributing the bulk of the model order reduction to the cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the two-field formulation of the quasi-static Biot's equations in bounded domains by means of the inf-sup theory. For this purpose, we exploit an equivalent four-field formulation of the equations, introducing the so-called total pressure and total fluid content as independent variables. We establish existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. Our stability estimate is two-sided and robust, meaning that the regularity established for the solution matches the regularity requirements for the data and the involved constants are independent of all material parameters. We prove also that additional regularity in space of the data implies, in some cases, corresponding additional regularity in space of the solution. These results are instrumental to the design and the analysis of discretizations enjoying accurate stability and error estimates.</description>

      <title>A nodally bound-preserving discontinuous Galerkin method for the drift-diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and analyse discontinuous Galerkin (dG) methods for the drift-diffusion model. We explore two dG formulations: a classical interior penalty approach and a nodally bound-preserving method. Whilst the interior penalty method demonstrates well-posedness and convergence, it fails to guarantee non-negativity of the solution. To address this deficit, which is often important to ensure in applications, we employ a positivity-preserving method based on a convex subset formulation, ensuring the non-negativity of the solution at the Lagrange nodes. We validate our findings by summarising extensive numerical experiments, highlighting the novelty and effectiveness of our approach in handling the complexities of charge carrier transport.</description>

      <title>A polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method solving three-dimensional heat conduction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we derived a three-dimensional scaled boundary finite element formulation for heat conduction problems. By incorporating Wachspress shape functions, a polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method (PSBFEM) was proposed to address heat conduction challenges in complex geometries. To address the complexity of traditional methods, this work introduced polygonal discretization techniques that simplified the topological structure of the polyhedral mesh and effectively integrated polyhedral and octree meshes, thereby reducing the number of element faces and enhancing mesh efficiency to accommodate intricate shapes. The developed formulation supported both steady-state and transient heat conduction analyses and was implemented in ABAQUS through a user-defined element (UEL). Through a series of numerical examples, the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method were validated. The results indicated that the PSBFEM consistently achieved higher accuracy than the FEM as the mesh was refined. The polyhedral elements offered a computationally efficient solution for complex simulations, significantly reducing computational costs.Additionally, by utilizing the octree mesh parent element acceleration technique, the computational efficiency of PSBFEM surpassed that of the FEM.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo for partial differential equations with generalized Gaussian input uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in uncertainty quantification for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with Gevrey regular inputs. The Gevrey class contains functions that are infinitely smooth with a growth condition on the higher-order partial derivatives, but which are nonetheless not analytic in general. Recent studies by Chernov and Le (Comput. Math. Appl., 2024, and SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2024) as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and Schwab (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2024) analyze the setting wherein the input random field is assumed to be uniformly bounded with respect to the uncertain parameters. In this paper, we relax this assumption and allow for parameter-dependent bounds. The parametric inputs are modeled as generalized Gaussian random variables, and we analyze the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration to assess the PDE response statistics using randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules. In addition to the QMC error analysis, we also consider the dimension truncation and finite element errors in this setting.</description>

      <title>Reformulated formulation and efficient fully discrete finite element method for a conductive ferrofluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider numerical approximation of an electrically conductive ferrofluid model, which consists of Navier-Stokes equations, magnetization equation, and magnetic induction equation. To solve this highly coupled, nonlinear, and multiphysics system efficiently, we develop a decoupled, linear, second-order in time, and unconditionally energy stable finite element scheme. We incorporate several distinct numerical techniques, including reformulations of the equations and a scalar auxiliary variable to handle the coupled nonlinear terms,a symmetric implicit-explicit treatment for the symmetric positive definite nonlinearity, and stable finite element approximations. We also prove that the numerical scheme is provably uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable rigorously. A series of numerical examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and performance of our scheme.</description>

      <title>The Numerical Approximation of Caputo Fractional Derivative of Higher Orders Using A Shifted Gegenbauer Pseudospectral Method: Two-Point Boundary Value Problems of the Bagley Torvik Type Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a new framework for approximating Caputo fractional derivatives (FDs) of any positive order using a shifted Gegenbauer pseudospectral (SGPS) method. By transforming the Caputo FD into a scaled integral of the $m$th-derivative of the Lagrange interpolating polynomial (with $m$ being the ceiling of the fractional order $\alpha$), we mitigate the singularity near zero, improving stability and accuracy. The method links $m$th-derivatives of shifted Gegenbauer (SG) polynomials with SG polynomials of lower degrees, allowing for precise integration using SG quadratures. We employ orthogonal collocation and SG quadratures in barycentric form to obtain an accurate and efficient approach for solving fractional differential equations. We provide error analysis showing that the SGPS method is convergent in a semi-analytic framework and conditionally convergent with exponential rate for smooth functions in finite-precision arithmetic. This exponential convergence improves accuracy compared to wavelet-based, operational matrix, and finite difference methods. The SGPS method is flexible, with adjustable SG parameters for optimal performance. A key contribution is the fractional SG integration matrix (FSGIM), which enables efficient computation of Caputo FDs via matrix-vector multiplications and accelerates the SGPS method through pre-computation and storage. The method remains within double-precision limits, making it computationally efficient. It handles any positive fractional order $\alpha$ and outperforms existing schemes in solving Caputo fractional two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs) of the Bagley-Torvik type.</description>

      <title>Fully spectral scheme for the linear BGK equation on the whole space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we design a fully spectral method in both space and velocity for a linear inhomogeneous kinetic equation with mass, momentum and energy conservation. We focus on the linear BGK equation with a confinement potential $\phi$, even if the method could be applied to different collision operators. It is based upon the projection on Hermite polynomials in velocity and orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight $e^{-\phi}$ in space. The potential $\phi$ is assumed to be a polynomial. It is, to the author's knowledge, the first scheme which preserves hypocoercive behavior in addition to the conservation laws. These different properties are illustrated numerically on both quadratic and double well potential.</description>

      <title>A deep implicit-explicit minimizing movement method for option pricing in jump-diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning approach for pricing European basket options written on assets that follow jump-diffusion dynamics. The option pricing problem is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation, which is approximated via a new implicit-explicit minimizing movement time-stepping approach, involving approximation by deep, residual-type Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for each time step. The integral operator is discretized via two different approaches: (a) a sparse-grid Gauss-Hermite approximation following localised coordinate axes arising from singular value decompositions, and (b) an ANN-based high-dimensional special-purpose quadrature rule. Crucially, the proposed ANN is constructed to ensure the appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for large values of the underlyings and also leads to consistent outputs with respect to a priori known qualitative properties of the solution. The performance and robustness with respect to the dimension of these methods are assessed in a series of numerical experiments involving the Merton jump-diffusion model, while a comparison with the deep Galerkin method and the deep BSDE solver with jumps further supports the merits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Simple matrix expressions for the curvatures of Grassmannian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that modeling a Grassmannian as symmetric orthogonal matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} Q = I, \; Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = Q,\; \operatorname{tr}(Q)=2k - n\}$ yields exceedingly simple matrix formulas for various curvatures and curvature-related quantities, both intrinsic and extrinsic. These include Riemann, Ricci, Jacobi, sectional, scalar, mean, principal, and Gaussian curvatures; Schouten, Weyl, Cotton, Bach, Pleba\'nski, cocurvature, nonmetricity, and torsion tensors; first, second, and third fundamental forms; Gauss and Weingarten maps; and upper and lower delta invariants. We will derive explicit, simple expressions for the aforementioned quantities in terms of standard matrix operations that are stably computable with numerical linear algebra. Many of these aforementioned quantities have never before been presented for the Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Approximating Perturbed Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider trajectory optimal control problems in which parameter uncertainty limits the applicability of control trajectories computed prior to travel. Hence, efficient trajectory adjustment is needed to ensure successful travel. However, it is often prohibitive or impossible to recalculate the optimal control in-transit due to strict time constraints or limited onboard computing resources. Thus, we propose a framework for quick and accurate trajectory approximations by using post-optimality sensitivity information. This allows the reduction of uncertain parameter space and an instantaneous approximation of the new optimal controller while using sensitivity data computed and stored pretransit.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary discrete shock profiles for scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For scalar conservation laws, we prove that spectrally stable stationary Lax discrete shock profiles are nonlinearly stable in some polynomially-weighted $\ell^1$ and $\ell^\infty$ spaces. In comparison with several previous nonlinear stability results on discrete shock profiles, we avoid the introduction of any weakness assumption on the amplitude of the shock and apply our analysis to a large family of schemes that introduce some artificial possibly high-order viscosity. The proof relies on a precise description of the Green's function of the linearization of the numerical scheme about spectrally stable discrete shock profiles obtained in [Coeu25]. The present article also pinpoints the ideas for a possible extension of this nonlinear orbital stability result for discrete shock profiles in the case of systems of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Structured Fractional Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of structured fractional minimization problems. The numerator consists of a differentiable function, a simple nonconvex nonsmooth function, a concave nonsmooth function, and a convex nonsmooth function composed with a linear operator. The denominator is a continuous function that is either weakly convex or has a weakly convex square root. These problems are prevalent in various important applications in machine learning and data science. Existing methods, primarily based on subgradient methods and smoothing proximal gradient methods, often suffer from slow convergence and numerical stability issues. In this paper, we introduce {\sf FADMM}, the first Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers tailored for this class of problems. {\sf FADMM} decouples the original problem into linearized proximal subproblems, featuring two variants: one using Dinkelbach's parametric method ({\sf FADMM-D}) and the other using the quadratic transform method ({\sf FADMM-Q}). By introducing a novel Lyapunov function, we establish that {\sf FADMM} converges to $\epsilon$-approximate critical points of the problem within an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including sparse Fisher discriminant analysis, robust Sharpe ratio minimization, and robust sparse recovery, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

      <title>An Implementation of the Finite Element Method in Hybrid Classical/Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the Quantum Finite Element Method (Q-FEM) developed for use in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and employs the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) algorithm. The proposed method leverages the classical FEM procedure to perform the unitary decomposition of the stiffness matrix and employs generator functions to design explicit quantum circuits corresponding to the unitaries. Q-FEM keeps the structure of the finite element discretization intact allowing for the use of variable element lengths and material coefficients in FEM discretization. The proposed method is tested on a steady-state heat equation discretized using linear and quadratic shape functions. Numerical verification studies are performed on the IBM QISKIT simulator and it is demonstrated that Q-FEM is effective in converging to the correct solution for a variety of problems and model discretizations, including with different element lengths, variable coefficients, and different boundary conditions. The formalism developed herein is general and can be extended to problems with higher dimensions. However, numerical examples also demonstrate that the number of parameters for the variational ansatz scale exponentially with the number of qubits, and increases the odds of convergence. Moreover, the deterioration of system conditioning with problem size results in barren plateaus and convergence difficulties.</description>

      <title>Optimal control under uncertainty with joint chance state constraints: almost-everywhere bounds, variance reduction, and application to (bi-)linear elliptic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal control of PDEs under uncertainty with the state variable subject to joint chance constraints. The controls are deterministic, but the states are probabilistic due to random variables in the governing equation. Joint chance constraints ensure that the random state variable meets pointwise bounds with high probability. For linear governing PDEs and elliptically distributed random parameters, we prove existence and uniqueness results for almost-everywhere state bounds. Using the spherical-radial decomposition (SRD) of the uncertain variable, we prove that when the probability is very large or small, the resulting Monte Carlo estimator for the chance constraint probability exhibits substantially reduced variance compared to the standard Monte Carlo estimator. We further illustrate how the SRD can be leveraged to efficiently compute derivatives of the probability function, and discuss different expansions of the uncertain variable in the governing equation. Numerical examples for linear and bilinear PDEs compare the performance of Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling methods, examining probability estimation convergence as the number of samples increases. We also study how the accuracy of the probabilities depends on the truncation of the random variable expansion, and numerically illustrate the variance reduction of the SRD.</description>

      <title>Residual-based Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration for sparse Hermitian eigenvalue problems tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chebyshev Filtered Subspace Iteration (ChFSI) has been widely adopted for computing a small subset of extreme eigenvalues in large sparse matrices. This work introduces a residual-based reformulation of ChFSI, referred to as R-ChFSI, designed to accommodate inexact matrix-vector products while maintaining robust convergence properties. By reformulating the traditional Chebyshev recurrence to operate on residuals rather than eigenvector estimates, the R-ChFSI approach effectively suppresses the errors made in matrix-vector products, improving the convergence behaviour for both standard and generalized eigenproblems. This ability of R-ChFSI to be tolerant to inexact matrix-vector products allows one to incorporate approximate inverses for large-scale generalized eigenproblems, making the method particularly attractive where exact matrix factorizations or iterative methods become computationally expensive for evaluating inverses. It also allows us to compute the matrix-vector products in lower-precision arithmetic allowing us to leverage modern hardware accelerators. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that R-ChFSI achieves desired residual tolerances while leveraging low-precision arithmetic. For problems with millions of degrees of freedom and thousands of eigenvalues, R-ChFSI attains final residual norms in the range of 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-14}$, even with FP32 and TF32 arithmetic, significantly outperforming standard ChFSI in similar settings. In generalized eigenproblems, where approximate inverses are used, R-ChFSI achieves residual tolerances up to ten orders of magnitude lower, demonstrating its robustness to approximation errors. Finally, R-ChFSI provides a scalable and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale eigenproblems in high-performance computing environments.</description>
