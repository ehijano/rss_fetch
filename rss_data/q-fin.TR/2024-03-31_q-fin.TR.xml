      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Agent-Based Market Simulation: Unveiling Realistic Stylized Facts and Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investors and regulators can greatly benefit from a realistic market simulator that enables them to anticipate the consequences of their decisions in real markets. However, traditional rule-based market simulators often fall short in accurately capturing the dynamic behavior of market participants, particularly in response to external market impact events or changes in the behavior of other participants. In this study, we explore an agent-based simulation framework employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents. We present the implementation details of these RL agents and demonstrate that the simulated market exhibits realistic stylized facts observed in real-world markets. Furthermore, we investigate the behavior of RL agents when confronted with external market impacts, such as a flash crash. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness and adaptability of RL-based agents within the simulation, offering insights into their response to significant market events.</description>

      <title>Volatility-based strategy on Chinese equity index ETF options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the performance of a volatility-based strategy using Chinese equity index ETF options. Initially successful, the strategy's effectiveness waned post-2018. By integrating GARCH models for volatility forecasting, the strategy's positions and exposures are dynamically adjusted. The results indicate that such an approach can enhance returns in volatile markets, suggesting potential for refined trading strategies in China's evolving derivatives landscape. The research underscores the importance of adaptive strategies in capturing market opportunities amidst changing trading dynamics.</description>
