      <title>A maximal oscillatory operator on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous research about an oscillatory integral operator $T_{\alpha, \beta}$ on compact manifolds $\mathbb{M}$. We prove the sharp $H^{p}$-$L^{p,\infty}$ boundedness on the maximal operator $T^{*}_{\alpha, \beta}$ for all $0&lt;p&lt;1$. As applications, we first prove the sharp $H^{p}$-$L^{p,\infty}$ boundedness on the maximal operator corresponding to the Riesz means $I_{k,\alpha}(|\mathcal{L}|)$ associated with the Schr\"odinger type group $e^{is\mathcal{L}^{\alpha/2}}$ and obtain the almost everywhere convergence of $I_{k,\alpha}(|\mathcal{L}|)f(x,t)\to f(x)$ for all $f\in H^{p}$. Also, we are able to obtain the convergence speed of a combination operator from the solutions of the Cauchy problem of fractional Schr\"odinger equations. All results are even new on the n-torus $T^{n}$.</description>

      <title>Two novel fully decoupled schemes for the two-phase MHD system with exactly divergence-free magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-phase magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system based on a magnetic potential formulation in 3D case. This model ensures exactly divergence-free approximation of the magnetic field by introducing magnetic potential A and defining magnetic field B = curl A. Then, we give two completely decoupled, first-order, linear and energy stable schemes, and strictly derive the unconditional energy stability of both schemes under time discretization. Finally, several numerical examples demonstrate the stability and effectiveness for our schemes.</description>

      <title>Systems of differential operators in time-periodic Gelfand-Shilov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the global properties of time-independent systems of operators in the framework of Gelfand-Shilov spaces. Our main results provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for global solvability and global hypoellipticity, based on analysis of the symbols of operators. We also present a class of time-dependent operators whose solvability and hypoellipticity are linked to the same properties of an associated time-independent system, albeit with a loss of regularity for temporal variables.</description>

      <title>Global Solutions and Asymptotic Behavior for the Three-dimensional Viscous Non-resistive MHD System with Some Large Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the global existence of solutions with some large perturbations to the incompressible, viscous, and non-resistive MHD system in a three-dimensional periodic domain, where the impressed magnetic field satisfies the Diophantine condition, and the intensity of the impressed magnetic field, denoted by $m$, is large compared to the perturbations. It was proved by Jiang--Jiang that the highest-order derivatives of the velocity increase with $m$, and the convergence rate of the nonlinear system towards a linearized problem is of $m^{-1/2}$ in [F. Jiang and S. Jiang, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 247 (2023), 96]. In this paper, we adopt a different approach by leveraging vorticity estimates to establish the highest-order energy estimate. This strategy prevents the appearance of terms that grow with $m$, and thus the increasing behavior of the highest-order derivatives of the velocity with respect to $m$ does not appear. Additionally, we use the vorticity estimate to demonstrate the convergence rate of the nonlinear system towards a linearized problem as time or $m$ approaches infinity. Notably, our analysis reveals that the convergence rate in $m$ is faster compared to the finding of Jiang--Jiang. Finally, a key contribution of our work is the identification of an integrable time-decay of the lower dissipation, which can replace the time-decay of lower energy in closing the highest-order energy estimate. This finding significantly relaxes the regularity requirements for the initial perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear partial differential equation that arises when introducing inertial effects in the Kuramoto model. Based on the known theory of degenerate Kolmogorov operators, we prove existence, uniqueness and a priori estimates of the solution to the relevant Cauchy problem. Moreover, a stable numerical operator, which is consistent with the degenerate Kolmogorov operator, is introduced in order to produce numerical solutions. Finally, numerical experiments show how the synchronization phenomena depend on the parameters of the Kuramoto model with inertia.</description>

      <title>Extended Sobolev scale for vector bundles, and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extended Sobolev scale for vector bundles over smooth closed manifolds and investigate its interpolation properties. This scale is built on the base of the inner product H\"ormander spaces whose order of regularity is given by an arbitrary positive function OR-varying at infinity in the sense of Avakumovi\'c. We prove that this scale is obtained by the interpolation with a function parameter between inner product Sobolev spaces, is closed with respect to the interpolation with a function parameter, and consists of all Hilbert spaces that are interpolation spaces between inner product Sobolev spaces. We also show that the spaces belonging to the scale introduced does not depend (up to equivalence of norms) on the choice of local charts on manifold and local trivializations of the bundle. Moreover, we prove embedding theorems and a duality theorem for this scale. We consider an elliptic pseudodifferential operators acting between vector bundles of the same rank on the extended Sobolev scale. We prove that this operator is bounded and Fredholm on pairs of appropriate H\"ormander spaces. An a priori estimate is established for the solutions and their local regularity is investigated. We also find new sufficient conditions for the solutions to have continuous derivatives of a given order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we unveil novel monotonicity conditions applicable for Mean Field Games through the exploration of finite dimensional $canonical\ transformations$. Our findings contribute to establishing new global well-posedness results for the associated master equations, also in the case of potentially degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Additionally, we show that recent advancements in global well-posedness results, specifically those related to displacement semi-monotone and anti-monotone data, can be easily obtained as a consequence of our main results.</description>

      <title>Incompleteness of Sinclair-type continuum flexible boundary conditions for atomistic fracture simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elastic field around a crack opening is known to be described by continuum linearised elasticity in leading order. In this work, we explicitly develop the next term in the atomistic asymptotic expansion in the case of a Mode III crack in anti-plane geometry. The aim of such an expansion is twofold. First, we show that the well-known flexible boundary condition ansatz due to Sinclair is incomplete, meaning that, in principle, employing it in atomistic fracture simulations is no better than using boundary conditions from continuum linearised elasticity. And secondly, the higher order far-field expansion can be employed as a boundary condition for high-accuracy atomistic simulations. To obtain our results, we develop an asymptotic expansion of the associated lattice Green's function. In an interesting departure from the recently developed theory for spatially homogeneous cases, this includes a novel notion of a discrete geometry predictor, which accounts for the peculiar discrete geometry near the crack tip.</description>

      <title>Existence, regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions for a nonlocal Chafee-Infante Problem via semigroup theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the study of a non-local one-dimensional quasilinear problem with continuous forcing. We use a time-reparameterization to obtain a semilinear problem and study a more general equation using semigroup theory. The existence of mild solutions is established without uniqueness with the aid of the formula of variation of constants and asking only a suitable modulus of continuity on the nonlinearity this mild solution is shown to be strong. Comparison results are also established with the aid of the formula of variation of constants and using these comparison results, global existence is obtained with the additional requirement that the nonlinearity satisfy a structural condition. The existence of pullback attractor is also established for the associated multivalued process along with the uniform bounds given by the comparison results with the additional requirement that the nonlinearity be dissipative. As much as possible the results are abstract so that they can be also applied to other models.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for Singular Interacting Particle Systems Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interacting systems particle driven by i.i.d. fractional Brownian motions, subject to irregular, possibly distributional, pairwise interactions. We show propagation of chaos and mean field convergence to the law of the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, as the number of particles $N\to\infty$, with quantitative sharp rates of order $N^{-1/2}$. Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in (0,+\infty)\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises. In particular, as $H$ decreases to $0$, interaction kernels of arbitrary singularity can be considered, a phenomenon frequently observed in regularization by noise results. Our proofs rely on a combinations of Sznitman's direct comparison argument with stochastic sewing techniques.</description>

      <title>Geometric inverse problems on gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On gas giant planets the speed of sound is isotropic and goes to zero at the surface. Geometrically, this corresponds to a Riemannian manifold whose metric tensor has a conformal blow-up near the boundary. The blow-up is tamer than in asymptotically hyperbolic geometry: the boundary is at a finite distance.
  We study the differential geometry of such manifolds, especially the asymptotic behavior of geodesics near the boundary. We relate the geometry to the propagation of singularities of a hydrodynamic PDE and we give the basic properties of the Laplace--Beltrami operator. We solve two inverse problems, showing that the interior structure of a gas giant is uniquely determined by different types of boundary data.</description>

Abstract: The sharp range of Sobolev spaces is determined in which the Cauchy problem for the classical Zakharov system is well-posed, which includes existence of solutions, uniqueness, persistence of initial regularity, and real-analytic dependence on the initial data. In addition, under a condition on the data for the Schr\"odinger equation at the lowest admissible regularity, global well-posedness and scattering is proved. The results cover energy-critical and energy-supercritical dimensions $d \geqslant 4$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a family of interaction energies given by kernels having a ''well-barrier'' shape, and investigate how these kernels drive the formation of multiple flocks within a larger population. We use the dichotomy case of the concentration compactness principle to obtain an energy minimizer, even though minimizing sequences are expected to break apart into flocks which may move far away from one another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness in $H^{\sigma}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $\sigma \in [0,\infty)$ of a parametrically forced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (PFNLS) in one dimension driven by multiplicative Stratonovich noise which has spatially homogeneous statistics. The noise is white in time and correlated in space. We first construct local mild solutions via a fixed-point argument. We then formulate a blow-up criterion by showing that the equation has persistence of integrability and regularity as long as the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-norm of the solution remains finite. Afterwards we derive a pathwise estimate on the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-norm using a mild It\^o formula. Our results also apply to the standard cubic NLS equation driven by multiplicative translation-invariant Stratonovich noise.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blow-up to hyperbolic Keller-Segel system of consumption type with logarithmic sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with a hyperbolic Keller-Segel system of consumption type with the logarithmic sensitivity \begin{equation*}
  \partial_{t} \rho = - \chi\nabla \cdot \left (\rho \nabla \log c\right),\quad \partial_{t} c = - \mu c\rho\quad (\chi,\,\mu&gt;0) \end{equation*} in $\mathbb{R}^d\; (d \ge1)$ for nonvanishing initial data. This system is closely related to tumor angiogenesis, an important example of chemotaxis. We firstly show the local existence of smooth solutions corresponding to nonvanishing smooth initial data. Next, through Riemann invariants, we present some sufficient conditions of this initial data for finite-time singularity formation when $d=1$. We then prove that for any $d\ge1$, some nonvanishing $C^\infty$-data can become singular in finite time. Moreover, we derive detailed information about the behaviors of solutions when the singularity occurs. In particular, this information tells that singularity formation from some initial data is not because $c$ touches zero (which makes $\log c$ diverge) but due to the blowup of $C^1\times C^2$-norm of $(\rho,c)$. As a corollary, we also construct initial data near any constant equilibrium state which blows up in finite time for any $d\ge1$. Our results are the extension of finite-time blow-up results in \cite{IJ21}, where initial data is required to satisfy some vanishing conditions. Furthermore, we interpret our results in a way that some kinds of damping or dissipation of $\rho$ are necessarily required to ensure the global existence of smooth solutions even though initial data are small perturbations around constant equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Regularity of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps into spheres and sharp Kato inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study regularity of minimizing $p$-harmonic maps $u \colon B^3 \to \mathbb{S}^3$ for $p$ in the interval $[2,3]$. For a long time, regularity was known only for $p = 3$ (essentially due to Morrey) and $p = 2$ (Schoen-Uhlenbeck), but recently Gastel extended the latter result to $p \in [2,2+\frac{2}{15}]$ using a version of Kato inequality. Here, we establish regularity for a small interval $p\in [2.961,3]$ by combining Morrey's methods with Hardt and Lin's Extension Theorem. We also improve on the other result by obtaining regularity for $p \in [2,p_0]$ with $p_0 = \frac{3+\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.366$. In relation to this, we address a question posed by Gastel and prove a sharp Kato inequality for $p$-harmonic maps in two-dimensional domains, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On counterexamples to unique continuation for critically singular wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider wave equations with a critically singular potential $\xi \cdot \sigma^{-2}$ diverging as an inverse square at a hypersurface $\sigma = 0$. Our aim is to construct counterexamples to unique continuation from $\sigma = 0$ for this equation, provided there exists a family of null geodesics trapped near $\sigma = 0$. This extends the classical geometric optics construction of Alinhac-Baouendi (i) to linear differential operators with singular coefficients, and (ii) over non-small portions of $\sigma = 0$ - by showing that such counterexamples can be further continued as long as this null geodesic family remains trapped and regular. As an application to relativity and holography, we construct counterexamples to unique continuation from the conformal boundaries of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes for some Klein-Gordon equations; this complements the unique continuation results of the second author with Chatzikaleas, Holzegel, and McGill and suggests a potential mechanism for counterexamples to the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>s-stability for W^{s,n/s}-harmonic maps in homotopy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $s$-dependence for minimizing $W^{s,n/s}$-harmonic maps $u\colon \mathbb{S}^n \to \mathbb{S}^\ell$ in homotopy classes. Sacks--Uhlenbeck theory shows that, for each $s$, minimizers exist in a generating subset of $\pi_{n}(\mathbb{S}^\ell)$. We show that this generating subset can be chosen locally constant in $s$. We also show that as $s$ varies the minimal $W^{s,n/s}$-energy in each homotopy class changes continuously. In particular, we provide progress to a question raised by Mironescu and Brezis--Mironescu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the global hypoellipticity of $G$-invariant operators on homogeneous vector bundles. These criteria are established in terms of the corresponding matrix-valued symbols as developed by Ruzhansky and Turunen and extended in [7] to homogeneous vector-bundles.</description>

      <title>Schauder type estimates for degenerate or singular elliptic equations with Dini mean oscillation coefficients with application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study degenerate or singular elliptic equations in divergence form $$-\text{div}(x_n^\alpha A\nabla u)=\text{div}(x_n^\alpha \mathbf{g})\quad\text{in }B_1\cap\{x_n&gt;0\}.$$ When $\alpha&gt;-1$, we establish boundary Schauder type estimates under the conormal boundary condition on the flat boundary, provided that the coefficients satisfy Dini mean oscillation type conditions. Additionally, as an application, we derive higher-order boundary Harnack principles for uniformly elliptic equations in divergence form with Dini mean oscillation coefficients.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation and Asymptotics of Cubically Nonlinear Transverse Magnetic Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Maxwell equations for transverse magnetic (TM) polarized fields support single frequency surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) localized at the interface of a metal and a dielectric. Metals are typically dispersive, i.e. the dielectric function depends on the frequency. We prove the bifurcation of localized SPPs in dispersive media in the presence of a cubic nonlinearity and provide an asymptotic expansion of the solution and the frequency. The problem is reduced to a system of nonlinear differential equations in one spatial dimension by assuming a plane wave dependence in the direction tangential to the (flat) interfaces. The number of interfaces is arbitrary and the nonlinear system is solved in a subspace of functions with the $H^1$-Sobolev regularity in each material layer. The corresponding linear system is an operator pencil in the frequency parameter due to the material dispersion. Because of the TM-polarization the problem cannot be reduced to a scalar equation.
  The studied bifurcation occurs at a simple isolated eigenvalue of the pencil. For geometries consisting of two or three homogeneous layers we provide explicit conditions on the existence of eigenvalues and on their simpleness and isolatedness. Real frequencies are shown to exist in the nonlinear setting in the case of PT-symmetric materials. We also apply a finite difference numerical method to the nonlinear system and compute bifurcating curves.</description>

      <title>A parabolic free transmission problem: flat free boundaries are smooth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a two-phase parabolic free boundary problem motivated by the jump of conductivity in composite materials that undergo a phase transition. Each phase is governed by a heat equation with distinct thermal conductivity, and a transmission-type condition is imposed on the free interface. We establish strong regularity properties of the free boundary: first, we prove that flat free boundaries are $C^{1,\alpha}$ by means of a linearization technique and compactness arguments. Then we use the Hodograph transform to achieve higher regularity. To this end, we prove a new Harnack-type inequality and develop the Schauder theory for parabolic linear transmission problems.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel fluctuations and quantitative homogenization for the one-dimensional Bouchaud trap model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present on-diagonal heat kernel estimates and quantitative homogenization statements for the one-dimensional Bouchaud trap model. The heat kernel estimates are obtained using standard techniques, with key inputs coming from a careful analysis of the volume growth of the invariant measure of the process under study. As for the quantitative homogenization results, these include both quenched and annealed Berry-Esseen-type theorems, as well as a quantitative quenched local limit theorem. Whilst the model we study here is a particularly simple example of a random walk in a random environment, we believe the roadmap we provide for establishing the latter result in particular will be useful for deriving quantitative local limit theorems in other, more challenging, settings.</description>
