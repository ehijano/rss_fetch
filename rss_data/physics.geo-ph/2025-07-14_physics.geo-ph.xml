      <title>Can the magnetic field induced by convective flow constrain the properties of Ganymede's subsurface ocean?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two main objectives. First, we assess the strength and measurability of Ganymede's ocean-induced magnetic field (OIMF) generated by the flow in the subsurface ocean. Second, we inspect how the OIMF constrains the ocean flow and Ganymede's internal structure and suggest a suitable metric for this purpose. We calculate the OIMF by solving the electromagnetic induction (EMI) equation in the simplified form, where we neglect the ocean-induced field in the advection term and the motionless induction. We show that this approach is sufficiently accurate by comparison with the solution of the full EMI equation. We also demonstrate that the OIMF is predominantly a stationary signal generated by the interaction of the toroidal component of the flow with Ganymede's internal field. The contributions to the OIMF due to the poloidal component of the flow and Jupiter's magnetic field can be neglected as second-order effects. The stationary OIMF is a measurable quantity with a few nT amplitude on Ganymede's surface if the ocean is sufficiently thick (approximately 400 km) and conductive (approximately 5 S/m). In this case, the specific footprint of the measured OIMF could be used to identify the flow regime (mode) of the convecting ocean. Additionally, the OIMF can be used to determine the ocean thickness since the OIMF pattern is shifted towards low latitudes if the ocean thickness is reduced.</description>

      <title>The viscoelastic rheology of transient diffusion creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains produced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be stored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of different mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is diffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as transient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient diffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes: a regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic behaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised extended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and as an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific relaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent depends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be related to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions in purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory experiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the observed attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative processes occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these simple models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Earth's Core-Mantle boundary from nutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.</description>
