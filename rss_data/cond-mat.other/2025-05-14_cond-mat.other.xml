      <title>Experimental Observation of Short-Range Magnetic Correlations in Amorphous Nb$_2$O$_5$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used muon spin rotation/relaxation/resonance ($\mu$SR) to investigate the magnetic properties of niobium pentoxide (Nb$_2$O$_5$) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta$_2$O$_5$) thin films. In their amorphous phase (sputter-deposited), both oxides exhibit magnetic behavior down to 2.8 K. However, the magnetic response is strongly structure-dependent: thermally-oxidized, poly-crystalline Ta$_2$O$_5$ shows suppressed magnetism, while amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$ demonstrates local static magnetism. In contrast, amorphous Nb$_2$O$_5$ is significantly more magnetically disordered. These results suggest that magnetic inhomogeneity in the native oxides of Ta and Nb may be a key factor in the performance of superconducting devices, particularly limiting T$_1$ for qubits and resonators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: \textit{can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective?} We answer this question and find that quantum crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Realizing non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

      <title>Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum of electromagnetic, acoustic, and water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waves of various types carry momentum, which is associated with their propagation direction, i.e., the phase gradient. The circulation of the wave momentum density gives rise to orbital angular momentum (AM). Additionally, for waves described by vector fields, local rotation of the wavefield produces spin AM (or simply, spin). These dynamical wave properties become particularly significant in structured (i.e., inhomogeneous) wavefields. Here we provide an introduction and overview of the momentum and AM properties for a variety of classical waves: electromagnetic, sound, elastic, plasma waves, and water surface waves. A unified field-theory approach, based on Noether's theorem, offers a general framework to describe these diverse physical systems, encompassing longitudinal, transverse, and mixed waves with different dispersion characteristics. We also discuss observable manifestations of the wave momentum and AM providing clear physical interpretations of the derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and instabilities in large-N holographic Fermi liquids: the vector fluctuations of the electron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic response of the AdS electron star in the vector sector, and compute the correlation functions and the transverse conductivity of the dual field theory. The system exhibits hydrodynamic behavior at low temperatures and near the critical temperature where the electron star undergoes the phase transition to the RN black hole. However, at intermediate temperatures the hydrodynamics does not exist. Remarkably, the system has an instability, i.e. a pole on the positive imaginary frequency axis at finite temperature. This instability is found both from analytical arguments and from numerics. Its physical meaning is so far unclear but it might mean that the ideal fluid limit for the star is a false vacuum.</description>
