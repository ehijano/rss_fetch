      <title>Main problems in constructing quantum theory based on finite mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As shown in our publications, quantum theory based on a finite ring of characteristic $p$ (FQT) is more general than standard quantum theory (SQT) because the latter is a degenerate case of the former in the formal limit $p\to\infty$. One of the main differences between SQT and FQT is the following. In SQT, elementary objects are described by irreducible representations (IRs) of a symmetry algebra in which energies are either only positive or only negative and there are no IRs where there are states with different signs of energy. In the first case, objects are called particles, and in the second - antiparticles. As a consequence, in SQT it is possible to introduce conserved quantum numbers (electric charge, baryon number, etc.) so that particles and antiparticles differ in the signs of these numbers. However, in FQT, all IRs necessarily contain states with both signs of energy. The symmetry in FQT is higher than the symmetry in SQT because one IR in FQT splits into two IRs in SQT with positive and negative energies at $p\to\infty$. Consequently, most fundamental quantum theory will not contain the concepts of particle-antiparticle and additive quantum numbers. These concepts are only good approximations at present since at this stage of the universe the value $p$ is very large but it was not so large at earlier stages. The above properties of IRs in SQT and FQT have been discussed in our publications with detailed technical proofs. The purpose of this paper is to consider models where these properties can be derived in a much simpler way.</description>

      <title>Why does Schr\"odinger's cat refuse to be quantic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both at formal and philosophical levels, decades of efforts have been devoted to a deciphering of the `quantum enigma', the `crazy way quantum objects behave', to quote R.P. Feynman's words. We posit that the enigma cannot recede without resorting to a thorough questioning of the quantum ontology. In the current paper this questioning is introduced through a revisitation of the famous Schr\"odinger's cat paradox, and of the main attempts at solving it. Our proposal thereof, is that the quantum world enjoys a sound physical reality (complying, in particular, with the scientifc requirement of experimental reproducibility), but also, that this physical reality calls for an enlarged, and however precise notion of `what is real', such that what is real and actual can be distinguished from what is real but potential</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement without nonlocal causation in (3,2)-dimensional spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims at exploring whether the nonlocal correlations due to quantum entanglement could exist without nonlocal causation. This is done with the aid of a toy model to investigate whether the ability of two quantum entangled particles to "correlate" their behaviors even at very large distances and in the absence of any physical connection can be seen as due to an exchange of information through an extra-temporal dimension. Since superluminal information exchange is forbidden in our (3,1) spacetime, an extra-temporal dimension is needed to recover the physical picture of finite velocity information exchange between entangled entities. Assuming that the geometry of space-time of dimension (3,2) is described by a metric containing a warping factor, the confinement of the massive particles in the extra time dimension follows. Therefore, why we do not experience an infinitely large extra time dimension can be explained. The toy model proposed here is defined by borrowing Bohm-Bub's proposal to describe the wavefunction collapse using nonlinear (non-unitary) dynamical equations and then elaborating this approach for an entangled system. The model so obtained is just speculative without any claim of being robust against any criticism, nevertheless, it satisfies the purpose of giving the possibility to the hypotheses formulated above to be verified experimentally; in fact, it proposes an experiment potentially interesting which would otherwise be immediately dismissed as manifestly trivial. The proposed experiment would consist of checking the possible violation of Bell's inequality between two identical but independent systems under appropriate conditions. Beyond its theoretical interest, entanglement is a key topic in quantum computing and quantum technologies, so any attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it could be useful.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Relativistic Bohmian Model of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09049v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-Time relativistic Bohmian Model (TTBM) is a theory in which the apparently paradoxical aspects of Quantum Mechanics are the effect of the existence of an extra unobservable time dimension. In this paper, the model is first rigorously and thoroughly summarized: definition, salient properties and observational explanations (double-slit experiment). Secondly, the theory is applied to a generic spherical atomic orbit, obtaining oscillations of the electron in the new time dimension, tau, that demonstrate the static nature of the orbitals. Something very similar happens in the case of a particle in box, where tau-oscillations cause the particle to spread out at steady states. Some speculations about spin and astrophysical follow. Finally, strengths and pending tasks of the model are summarized.</description>
