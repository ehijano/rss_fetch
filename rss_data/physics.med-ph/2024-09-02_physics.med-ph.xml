      <title>CNN Based Detection of Cardiovascular Diseases from ECG Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting myocardial infarction (MI) from Electrocardiogram (ECG) images. The model, built using the InceptionV3 architecture and optimized through transfer learning, was trained using ECG data obtained from the Ch. Pervaiz Elahi Institute of Cardiology in Pakistan. The dataset includes ECG images representing four different cardiac conditions: myocardial infarction, abnormal heartbeat, history of myocardial infarction, and normal heart activity. The developed model successfully detects MI and other cardiovascular conditions with an accuracy of 93.27%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based models can provide significant support to clinicians in the early detection and prevention of heart attacks.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for the assessment of water fraction-dependent longitudinal decay rates and magnetisation transfer in membrane lipid phantoms</title>

Abstract: Phantom systems consisting of liposome suspensions are widely employed to investigate quantitative MRI parameters mimicking cellular membranes. The proper physical understanding of the measurement results, however, requires proper models for liposomes and their interaction with the surrounding water molecules. Here, we present an MD-based approach for the theoretical prediction of R1=1/T1, the dependence of R1 on water concentration and the magnetization exchange between lipids and interacting water layer in lipids and lipid mixtures. Moreover, a new parameter is introduced which quantitatively measures the amount of hydration water (hydration water fraction, f_HW) based on conventional spoiled gradient echo MR acquisitions. Both f_HW and the magnetisation exchange rate between lipids and hydration water were determined quantitatively from spoiled gradient echo data. We observed that liposome systems behaved similarly, apart from PLPC which showed both lower hydration water fraction and lower exchange rate. The extracted parameters accurately predicted the measured water fraction-dependent R1 rates and allowed for a theoretical understanding of MR parameters in liposomes of different composition.</description>

      <title>Identifying Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder through the electroencephalogram complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14799</link>

Abstract: There are reasons to suggest that a number of mental disorders may be related to alteration in the neural complexity (NC). Thus, quantitative analysis of NC could be helpful in classifying mental and understanding conditions. Here, focusing on a methodological procedure, we have worked with young individuals, typical and with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) whose NC was assessed using q-statistics applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG was recorded while subjects performed the visual Attention Network Test (ANT) and during a short pretask period of resting state. Time intervals of the EEG amplitudes that passed a threshold were collected from task and pretask signals from each subject. The data were satisfactorily fitted with a stretched $q$-exponential including a power-law prefactor(characterized by the exponent c), thus determining the best $(c, q)$ for each subject, indicative of their individual complexity. We found larger values of $q$ and $c$ in ADHD subjects as compared with the typical subjects both at task and pretask periods, the task values for both groups being larger than at rest. The $c$ parameter was highly specific in relation to DSM diagnosis for inattention, where well-defined clusters were observed. The parameter values were organized in four well-defined clusters in $(c, q)$-space. As expected, the tasks apparently induced greater complexity in neural functional states with likely greater amount of internal information processing. The results suggest that complexity is higher in ADHD subjects than in typical pairs. The distribution of values in the $(c, q)$-space derived from $q$-statistics seems to be a promising biomarker for ADHD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend establishing the Dedicated International Accelerator Laboratory for Space Travel related radiation research (DIAL-ST) to advance this field and evaluate protective biological pathways through particle accelerator experiments simulating cosmic radiation.</description>
