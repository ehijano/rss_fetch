      <title>Allen: Rethinking MAS Design through Step-Level Policy Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) - Allen, designed to address two core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy, empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2) achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and human oversight in complex network topologies.
  Our core insight is to redefine the basic execution unit in the MAS, allowing agents to autonomously form different patterns by combining these units. We have constructed a four-tier state architecture (Task, Stage, Agent, Step) to constrain system behavior from both task-oriented and execution-oriented perspectives. This achieves a unification of topological optimization and controllable progress.
  Allen grants unprecedented Policy Autonomy, while making a trade-off for the controllability of the collaborative structure. The project code has been open source at: https://github.com/motern88/Allen</description>

      <title>Defending a City from Multi-Drone Attacks: A Sequential Stackelberg Security Games Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To counter an imminent multi-drone attack on a city, defenders have deployed drones across the city. These drones must intercept/eliminate the threat, thus reducing potential damage from the attack. We model this as a Sequential Stackelberg Security Game, where the defender first commits to a mixed sequential defense strategy, and the attacker then best responds. We develop an efficient algorithm called S2D2, which outputs a defense strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of S2D2 in extensive experiments on data from 80 real cities, improving the performance of the defender in comparison to greedy heuristics based on prior works. We prove that under some reasonable assumptions about the city structure, S2D2 outputs an approximate Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium (SSE) with a convenient structure.</description>

      <title>Tapas are free! Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail completely. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Quantitative Measures for Multiparty Behaviour Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital humans are emerging as autonomous agents in multiparty interactions, yet existing evaluation metrics largely ignore contextual coordination dynamics. We introduce a unified, intervention-driven framework for objective assessment of multiparty social behaviour in skeletal motion data, spanning three complementary dimensions: (1) synchrony via Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis, (2) temporal alignment via Multiscale Empirical Mode Decompositionbased Beat Consistency, and (3) structural similarity via Soft Dynamic Time Warping. We validate metric sensitivity through three theory-driven perturbations -- gesture kinematic dampening, uniform speech-gesture delays, and prosodic pitch-variance reduction-applied to $\approx 145$ 30-second thin slices of group interactions from the DnD dataset. Mixed-effects analyses reveal predictable, joint-independent shifts: dampening increases CRQA determinism and reduces beat consistency, delays weaken cross-participant coupling, and pitch flattening elevates F0 Soft-DTW costs. A complementary perception study ($N=27$) compares judgments of full-video and skeleton-only renderings to quantify representation effects. Our three measures deliver orthogonal insights into spatial structure, timing alignment, and behavioural variability. Thereby forming a robust toolkit for evaluating and refining socially intelligent agents. Code available on \href{https://github.com/tapri-lab/gig-interveners}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>FACET:Teacher-Centred LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems-Towards Personalized Educational Worksheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing heterogeneity of student populations poses significant challenges for teachers, particularly in mathematics education, where cognitive, motivational, and emotional differences strongly influence learning outcomes. While AI-driven personalization tools have emerged, most remain performance-focused, offering limited support for teachers and neglecting broader pedagogical needs. This paper presents the FACET framework, a teacher-facing, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system designed to generate individualized classroom materials that integrate both cognitive and motivational dimensions of learner profiles. The framework comprises three specialized agents: (1) learner agents that simulate diverse profiles incorporating topic proficiency and intrinsic motivation, (2) a teacher agent that adapts instructional content according to didactical principles, and (3) an evaluator agent that provides automated quality assurance. We tested the system using authentic grade 8 mathematics curriculum content and evaluated its feasibility through a) automated agent-based assessment of output quality and b) exploratory feedback from K-12 in-service teachers. Results from ten internal evaluations highlighted high stability and alignment between generated materials and learner profiles, and teacher feedback particularly highlighted structure and suitability of tasks. The findings demonstrate the potential of multi-agent LLM architectures to provide scalable, context-aware personalization in heterogeneous classroom settings, and outline directions for extending the framework to richer learner profiles and real-world classroom trials.</description>

      <title>A Dynamically Weighted ADMM Framework for Byzantine Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) is a popular method to solve distributed consensus optimization utilizing efficient communication among various nodes in the network. However, in the presence of faulty or attacked nodes, even a small perturbation (or sharing false data) during the communication can lead to divergence of the solution. To address this issue, in this work we consider ADMM under the effect of Byzantine threat, where an unknown subset of nodes is subject to Byzantine attacks or faults. We propose Dynamically Weighted ADMM (DW-ADMM), a novel variant of ADMM that uses dynamic weights on the edges of the network, thus promoting resilient distributed optimization. We establish that the proposed method (i) produces a nearly identical solution to conventional ADMM in the error-free case, and (ii) guarantees a bounded solution with respect to the global minimizer, even under Byzantine threat. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using an illustrative numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Smooth Games of Configuration in the Linear-Quadratic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory offers a toolbox for formalizing and solving for both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies in multi-agent scenarios. However, the optimal configuration of such games remains largely unexplored. While there is existing literature on the parametrization of dynamic games, little research examines this parametrization from a strategic perspective where each agent's configuration choice is influenced by the decisions of others. In this work, we introduce the concept of a game of configuration, providing a framework for the strategic fine-tuning of differential games. We define a game of configuration as a two-stage game within the setting of finite-horizon, affine-quadratic, AQ, differential games. In the first stage, each player chooses their corresponding configuration parameter, which will impact their dynamics and costs in the second stage. We provide the subgame perfect solution concept and a method for computing first stage cost gradients over the configuration space. This then allows us to formulate a gradient-based method for searching for local solutions to the configuration game, as well as provide necessary conditions for equilibrium configurations over their downstream (second stage) trajectories. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in example AQ systems, both zero-sum and general-sum.</description>

      <title>Synergy Over Spiral: A Logistics 5.0 Game-Theoretic Model for Trust-Fatigue Co-regulation in Human-Cobot Order Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the critical role of trust and fatigue in human-cobot collaborative order picking, framing the challenge within the scope of Logistics 5.0: the implementation of human-robot symbiosis in smart logistics. We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this interaction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and trust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model leads to a "trust death spiral," a refined trust model creates a "trust synergy cycle," increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a cobot operating in a Trust-Recovery Mode can overcome system brittleness after a disruption, reducing trust recovery time by over 75 percent compared to a non-adaptive model. Our findings provide a framework for designing intelligent cobot behaviors that fulfill the Industry 5.0 pillars of human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Chasing Moving Targets with Online Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Safer Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive, disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input. Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).</description>
