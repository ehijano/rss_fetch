      <title>IMEX methods for thin-film equations and Cahn-Hilliard equations with variable mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a class of splitting schemes employing implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-stepping to achieve accurate and energy-stable solutions for thin-film equations and Cahn-Hilliard models with variable mobility. This splitting method incorporates a linear, constant coefficient implicit step, facilitating efficient computational implementation. We investigate the influence of stabilizing splitting parameters on the numerical solution computationally, considering various initial conditions. Furthermore, we generate energy-stability plots for the proposed methods, examining different choices of splitting parameter values and timestep sizes. These methods enhance the accuracy of the original bi-harmonic-modified (BHM) approach, while preserving its energy-decreasing property and achieving second-order accuracy. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>The Numerical Solution of the External Dirichlet Generalized Harmonic Problem for a Sphere by the Method of Probabilistic Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, an algorithm for the numerical solution of the external Dirichlet generalized harmonic problem for a sphere by the method of probabilistic solution (MPS) is given, where generalized indicates that a boundary function has a finite number of first kind discontinuity curves. The algorithm consists of the following main stages: (1) the transition from an infinite domain to a finite domain by an inversion; (2) the consideration of a new Dirichlet generalized harmonic problem on the basis of Kelvin theorem for the obtained finite domain; (3) the numerical solution of the new problem for the finite domain by the MPS, which in turn is based on a computer simulation of the Weiner process; (4) finding the probabilistic solution of the posed generalized problem at any fixed points of the infinite domain by the solution of the new problem. For illustration, numerical examples are considered and results are presented.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a 1/2-equation model of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent 1/2-equation model of turbulence is a simplification of the standard Kolmogorov-Prandtl 1-equation URANS model. Surprisingly, initial numerical tests indicated that the 1/2-equation model produces comparable velocity statistics at reduced cost. It is also a test problem and first step for developing numerical analysis to address a full 1-equation model. This report begins the numerical analysis of the 1/2 equation model. Stability, convergence and error estimates are proven for a semi-discrete and fully discrete approximation. Finally, numerical tests are conducted to validate our convergence theory.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Resonances via AAA Rational Approximation of Randomly Scalarized Boundary Integral Resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel algorithm, based on use of rational approximants of randomly scalarized boundary integral resolvents, for the evaluation of acoustic and electromagnetic resonances in open and closed cavities; for simplicity we restrict treatment to cavities in two-dimensional space. The desired open cavity resonances (also known as ``eigenvalues'' for interior problems, and ``scattering poles'' for exterior and open problems) are obtained as the poles of associated rational approximants; both the approximants and their poles are obtained by means of the recently introduced AAA rational-approximation algorithm. In fact, the proposed resonance-search method applies to any nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP) associated with a given function $F: U \to \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$, wherein a complex value $k$ is sought for which $F_kw = 0$ for some nonzero $w\in \mathbb{C}^n$. For the cavity problems considered in this paper, $F_k$ is taken as a spectrally discretized version of a Green function-based boundary integral operator at spatial frequency $k$. In all cases, the scalarized resolvent is given by an expression of the form $u^* F_k^{-1} v$, where $u,v \in \mathbb{C}^n$ are fixed random vectors. A variety of numerical results are presented for both scattering resonances and other NEPs, demonstrating the accuracy of the method even for high frequency states.</description>

      <title>Summing divergent matrix series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend several celebrated methods in classical analysis for summing series of complex numbers to series of complex matrices. These include the summation methods of Abel, Borel, Ces\'aro, Euler, Lambert, N\"orlund, and Mittag-Leffler, which are frequently used to sum scalar series that are divergent in the conventional sense. One feature of our matrix extensions is that they are fully noncommutative generalizations of their scalar counterparts -- not only is the scalar series replaced by a matrix series, positive weights are replaced by positive definite matrix weights, order on $\mathbb{R}$ replaced by Loewner order, exponential function replaced by matrix exponential function, etc. We will establish the regularity of our matrix summation methods, i.e., when applied to a matrix series convergent in the conventional sense, we obtain the same value for the sum. Our second goal is to provide numerical algorithms that work in conjunction with these summation methods. We discuss how the block and mixed-block summation algorithms, the Kahan compensated summation algorithm, may be applied to matrix sums with similar roundoff error bounds. These summation methods and algorithms apply not only to power or Taylor series of matrices but to any general matrix series including matrix Fourier and Dirichlet series. We will demonstrate the utility of these summation methods: establishing a Fej\'{e}r's theorem and alleviating the Gibbs phenomenon for matrix Fourier series; extending the domains of matrix functions and accurately evaluating them; enhancing the matrix Pad\'e approximation and Schur--Parlett algorithms; and more.</description>

      <title>The Neumann boundary condition for the two-dimensional Lax-Wendroff scheme. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of a two-dimensional Lax-Wendroff scheme in a quarter-plane. Following our previous work, we aim here at adapting the energy method in order to study second order extrapolation boundary conditions. We first show on the one-dimensional problem why modifying the energy is a necessity in order to obtain stability estimates. We then study the two-dimensional case and propose a modified energy as well as second order extrapolation boundary and corner conditions in order to maintain second order accuracy and stability of the whole scheme, including near the corner.</description>

      <title>Fast Numerical Approximation of Linear, Second-Order Hyperbolic Problems Using Model Order Reduction and the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work [F. Henr\'iquez and J. S. Hesthaven, arXiv:2403.02847 (2024)] to the linear, second-order wave equation in bounded domains. This technique, referred to as the Laplace Transform Reduced Basis (LT-RB) method, uses two widely known mathematical tools to construct a fast and efficient method for the solution of linear, time-dependent problems: The Laplace transform and the Reduced Basis method, hence the name.
  The application of the Laplace transform yields a time-independent problem parametrically depending on the Laplace variable. Following the two-phase paradigm of the RB method, firstly in an offline stage we sample the Laplace parameter, compute the full-order or high-fidelity solution, and then resort to a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to extract a basis of reduced dimension. Then, in an online phase, we project the time-dependent problem onto this basis and proceed to solve the evolution problem using any suitable time-stepping method. We prove exponential convergence of the reduced solution computed by the LT-RB method toward the high-fidelity one as the dimension of the reduced space increases.
  Finally, we present a set of numerical experiments portraying the performance of the method in terms of accuracy and, in particular, speed-up when compared to the full-order model.</description>

      <title>Stable semi-implicit SDC methods for conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) methods provide a systematic approach to construct time integration methods of arbitrarily high order for nonlinear evolution equations including conservation laws. They converge towards $A$- or even $L$-stable collocation methods, but are often not sufficiently robust themselves. In this paper, a family of SDC methods inspired by an implicit formulation of the Lax-Wendroff method is developed. Compared to fully implicit approaches, the methods have the advantage that they only require the solution of positive definite or semi-definite linear systems. Numerical evidence suggests that the proposed semi-implicit SDC methods with Radau points are $L$-stable up to order 11 and require very little diffusion for orders 13 and 15. The excellent stability and accuracy of these methods is confirmed by numerical experiments with 1D conservation problems, including the convection-diffusion, Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>High-order parallel-in-time method for the monodomain equation in cardiac electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of the monodomain equation, crucial for modeling the heart's electrical activity, faces scalability limits when traditional numerical methods only parallelize in space. To optimize the use of large multi-processor computers by distributing the computational load more effectively, time parallelization is essential. We introduce a high-order parallel-in-time method addressing the substantial computational challenges posed by the stiff, multiscale, and nonlinear nature of cardiac dynamics. Our method combines the semi-implicit and exponential spectral deferred correction methods, yielding a hybrid method that is extended to parallel-in-time employing the PFASST framework. We thoroughly evaluate the stability, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed parallel-in-time method through extensive numerical experiments, using practical ionic models such as the ten-Tusscher-Panfilov. The results underscore the method's potential to significantly enhance real-time and high-fidelity simulations in biomedical research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Combining physics-informed graph neural network and finite difference for solving forward and inverse spatiotemporal PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The great success of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has significantly advanced our simulation and understanding of complex physical systems in science and engineering. However, many PINN-like methods are poorly scalable and are limited to in-sample scenarios. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel discrete approach termed Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (PIGNN) to solve forward and inverse nonlinear PDEs. In particular, our approach seamlessly integrates the strength of graph neural networks (GNN), physical equations and finite difference to approximate solutions of physical systems. Our approach is compared with the PINN baseline on three well-known nonlinear PDEs (heat, Burgers and FitzHugh-Nagumo). We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method to work with irregular meshes, longer time steps, arbitrary spatial resolutions, varying initial conditions (ICs) and boundary conditions (BCs) by conducting extensive numerical experiments. Numerical results also illustrate the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy, time extrapolability, generalizability and scalability. The main advantage of our approach is that models trained in small domains with simple settings have excellent fitting capabilities and can be directly applied to more complex situations in large domains.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of optimal recovering univariate functions and their derivatives are studied. To solve these problems, two variants of the truncation method are constructed, which are order-optimal both in the sense of accuracy and in terms of the amount of involved Galerkin information. For numerical summation, it has been established how the parameters characterizing the problem being solved affect its stability.</description>

      <title>Variationally Correct Neural Residual Regression for Parametric PDEs: On the Viability of Controlled Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about learning the parameter-to-solution map for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that depend on a potentially large number of parameters covering all PDE types for which a stable variational formulation (SVF) can be found. A central constituent is the notion of variationally correct residual loss function meaning that its value is always uniformly proportional to the squared solution error in the norm determined by the SVF, hence facilitating rigorous a posteriori accuracy control. It is based on a single variational problem, associated with the family of parameter dependent fiber problems, employing the notion of direct integrals of Hilbert spaces. Since in its original form the loss function is given as a dual test norm of the residual a central objective is to develop equivalent computable expressions. A first critical role is played by hybrid hypothesis classes, whose elements are piecewise polynomial in (low-dimensional) spatio-temporal variables with parameter-dependent coefficients that can be represented, e.g. by neural networks. Second, working with first order SVFs, we distinguish two scenarios: (i) the test space can be chosen as an $L_2$-space (e.g. for elliptic or parabolic problems) so that residuals live in $L_2$ and can be evaluated directly; (ii) when trial and test spaces for the fiber problems (e.g. for transport equations) depend on the parameters, we use ultraweak formulations. In combination with Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin concepts the hybrid format is then instrumental to arrive at variationally correct computable residual loss functions. Our findings are illustrated by numerical experiments representing (i) and (ii), namely elliptic boundary value problems with piecewise constant diffusion coefficients and pure transport equations with parameter dependent convection field.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional approximations of the conditional law of Volterra processes: a non-positive curvature approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the conditional evolution of Volterra processes with stochastic volatility is a crucial challenge in mathematical finance. While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.</description>

      <title>Can the a.c.s. notion and the GLT theory handle approximated PDEs/FDEs with either moving or unbounded domains?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current note we consider matrix-sequences $\{B_{n,t}\}_n$ of increasing sizes depending on $n$ and equipped with a parameter $t&gt;0$. For every fixed $t&gt;0$, we assume that each $\{B_{n,t}\}_n$ possesses a canonical spectral/singular values symbol $f_t$ defined on $D_t\subset \R^{d}$ of finite measure, $d\ge 1$. Furthermore, we assume that $ \{ \{ B_{n,t}\} : \, t &gt; 0 \} $ is an approximating class of sequences (a.c.s.) for $ \{ A_n \} $ and that $ \bigcup_{t &gt; 0} D_t = D $ with $ D_{t + 1} \supset D_t $. Under such assumptions and via the notion of a.c.s, we prove results on the canonical distributions of $ \{ A_n \} $, whose symbol, when it exists, can be defined on the, possibly unbounded, domain $D$ of finite or even infinite measure.
  We then extend the concept of a.c.s. to the case where the approximating sequence $ \{ B_{n,t}\}_n $ has possibly a different dimension than the one of $ \{ A_n\} $. This concept seems to be particularly natural when dealing, e.g., with the approximation both of a partial differential equation (PDE) and of its (possibly unbounded, or moving) domain $D$, using an exhausting sequence of domains $\{ D_t \}$.
  Examples coming from approximated PDEs/FDEs with either moving or unbounded domains are presented in connection with the classical and the new notion of a.c.s., while numerical tests and a list of open questions conclude the present work.</description>

      <title>Low-rank and sparse approximations for contact mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Rephrased) Non-conformance decision-making processes in high-precision manufacturing of engineering structures are often delayed due to numerical simulations that are needed for analyzing the defective parts and assemblies. Interfaces between parts of assemblies can only be simulated using the modeling of contact. Thus, efficient parametric ROMs are necessary for performing contact mechanics simulations in near real-time scenarios. Typical strategies for reducing the cost of contact models use low-rank approximations. Assumptions include the existence of a low-dimensional subspace for displacement and a low-dimensional non-negative subcone for contact pressure. However, the contact pressure exhibits a local nature, as the position of contact can vary with parameters like loading or geometry. The adequacy of low-rank approximations for contact mechanics is investigated and alternative routes based on sparse regression techniques are explored. It is shown that the local nature leads to loss of linear separability of contact pressure, thereby limiting the accuracy of low-rank methods. The applicability of the low-rank assumption to contact pressure is analyzed using 3 different criteria: compactness, generalization and specificity. Subsequently, over-complete dictionaries with a large number of snapshots to mitigate the inseparability issues is investigated. Two strategies are devised: a greedy active-set method where the dictionary elements are selected greedily and a convex hull approximation method that eliminates the necessity of explicitly enforcing non-penetration constraints in convex problems. Lastly, Dynamic Time Warping is studied as a possible non-linear interpolation method that permits the exploration of the non-linear manifoldm synthesising snapshots not computed in the training set with low complexity; reducing the offline costs.</description>

      <title>Mixed finite element methods for fourth order obstacle problems in linearised elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a novel mixed Finite Element Method for approximating the solutions of fourth order variational problems subjected to a constraint.
  The first problem we consider consists in establishing the convergence of the error of the numerical approximation of the solution of a biharmonic obstacle problem. The contents of this section are meant to generalise the approach originally proposed by Ciarlet \&amp; Raviart, and then complemented by Ciarlet \&amp; Glowinski.
  The second problem we consider amounts to studying a two-dimensional variational problem for linearly elastic shallow shells subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space. We first study the case where the parametrisation of the middle surface for the linearly elastic shallow shell under consideration has non-zero curvature, and we observe that the numerical approximation of this model via a mixed Finite Element Method based on conforming elements requires the implementation of the additional constraint according to which the gradient matrix of the dual variable has to be symmetric. However, differently from the biharmonic obstacle problem previously studied, we show that the numerical implementation of this result cannot be implemented by solely resorting to Courant triangles.
  Finally, we show that if the middle surface of the linearly elastic shallow shell under consideration is flat, the symmetry constraint required for formulating the constrained mixed variational problem announced in the second part of the paper is not required, and the solution can thus be approximated by solely resorting to Courant triangles.
  The theoretical results we derived are complemented by a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Trajectory Inference in Wasserstein Space Using Consecutive Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing data from dynamic processes through cross-sectional measurements is seen in many fields such as computational biology. Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is instrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We rigorously evaluate our method by providing convergence guarantees and testing it on simulated cell data characterized by bifurcations and merges, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories, but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Zeroth- and First-order Stochastic Trust-Region Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model update (MU) and candidate evaluation (CE) are classical steps incorporated inside many stochastic trust-region (TR) algorithms. The sampling effort exerted within these steps, often decided with the aim of controlling model error, largely determines a stochastic TR algorithm's sample complexity. Given that MU and CE are amenable to variance reduction, we investigate the effect of incorporating common random numbers (CRN) within MU and CE on complexity. Using ASTRO and ASTRO-DF as prototype first-order and zeroth-order families of algorithms, we demonstrate that CRN's effectiveness leads to a range of complexities depending on sample-path regularity and the oracle order. For instance, we find that in first-order oracle settings with smooth sample paths, CRN's effect is pronounced -- ASTRO with CRN achieves $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ a.s. sample complexity compared to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. in the generic no-CRN setting. By contrast, CRN's effect is muted when the sample paths are not Lipschitz, with the sample complexity improving from $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-6})$ a.s. to $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ a.s. in the zeroth- and first-order settings, respectively. Since our results imply that improvements in complexity are largely inherited from generic aspects of variance reduction, e.g., finite-differencing for zeroth-order settings and sample-path smoothness for first-order settings within MU, we anticipate similar trends in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for A Stochastic Maximum Principle Based Data Driven Feedback Control Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents convergence analysis of a novel data-driven feedback control algorithm designed for generating online controls based on partial noisy observational data. The algorithm comprises a particle filter-enabled state estimation component, estimating the controlled system's state via indirect observations, alongside an efficient stochastic maximum principle type optimal control solver. By integrating weak convergence techniques for the particle filter with convergence analysis for the stochastic maximum principle control solver, we derive a weak convergence result for the optimization procedure in search of optimal data-driven feedback control. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Fractional differential problems with numerical anti-reflective boundary conditions: a computational/precision analysis and numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twenty years ago the anti-reflective numerical boundary conditions (BCs) were introduced in a context of signal processing and imaging, for increasing the quality of the reconstruction of a blurred signal/image contaminated by noise and for reducing the overall complexity to that of few fast sine transforms i.e. to $O(N\log N)$ real arithmetic operations, where $N$ is the number of pixels. Here for quality of reconstruction we mean a better accuracy and the elimination of boundary artifacts, called ringing effects. Now we propose numerical anti-reflective BCs in the context of nonlocal problems of fractional differential type: the goals are the same i.e. a smaller approximation error and the reduction of boundary artifacts. In the latter setting, we compare various types of numerical BCs, including the anti-symmetric ones considered in the case of fractional differential problems for modeling reasons. More in detail, given important similarities between anti-symmetric and anti-reflective BCs, we compare them from the perspective of computational efficiency, by considering nontruncated and truncated versions and also other standard numerical BCs such as reflective/Neumann. Several numerical tests, tables, and visualizations are provided and critically discussed. The conclusion is that the truncated numerical anti-reflective BCs perform better, both in terms of accuracy and low computational cost.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the convergence of a spatial semidiscretization of a three-dimensional stochastic Allen-Cahn equation with multiplicative noise. For non-smooth initial values, the regularity of the mild solution is investigated, and an error estimate is derived with the spatial $ L^2 $-norm. For smooth initial values, two error estimates with the general spatial $ L^q $-norms are established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of certifying the correctness of approximate solution paths computed by numerical homotopy continuation methods. We propose a conceptually simple approach based on a parametric variant of the Krawczyk method from interval arithmetic. Unlike most previous methods for certified path-tracking, our approach is applicable in the general setting of parameter homotopies commonly used to solve polynomial systems of equations. We also describe a novel preconditioning strategy and give theoretical correctness and termination results. Experiments using a preliminary implementation of the method indicate that our approach is competitive with specialized methods appearing previously in the literature, in spite of our more general setting.</description>

      <title>A high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian Runge-Kutta finite volume (EL-RK-FV) method for scalar nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of high-order Eulerian-Lagrangian Runge-Kutta finite volume methods that can numerically solve Burgers' equation with shock formations, which could be extended to general scalar conservation laws. Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) and semi-Lagrangian (SL) methods have recently seen increased development and have become a staple for allowing large time-stepping sizes. Yet, maintaining relatively large time-stepping sizes post shock formation remains quite challenging. Our proposed scheme integrates the partial differential equation on a space-time region partitioned by linear approximations to the characteristics determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition. We trace the characteristics forward in time and present a merging procedure for the mesh cells to handle intersecting characteristics due to shocks. Following this partitioning, we write the equation in a time-differential form and evolve with Runge-Kutta methods in a method-of-lines fashion. High-resolution methods such as ENO and WENO-AO schemes are used for spatial reconstruction. Extension to higher dimensions is done via dimensional splitting. Numerical experiments demonstrate our scheme's high-order accuracy and ability to sharply capture post-shock solutions with large time-stepping sizes.</description>

Abstract: We present a matrix-free multigrid method for high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods with GPU acceleration. A performance analysis is conducted, comparing various data and compute layouts. Smoother implementations are optimized through localization and fast diagonalization techniques. Leveraging conflict-free access patterns in shared memory, arithmetic throughput of up to 39% of the peak performance on Nvidia A100 GPUs are achieved. Experimental results affirm the effectiveness of mixed-precision approaches and MPI parallelization in accelerating algorithms. Furthermore, an assessment of solver efficiency and robustness is provided across both two and three dimensions, with applications to Poisson problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a GPU implementation of vertex-patch smoothers for higher order finite element methods in two and three dimensions. Analysis shows that they are not memory bound with respect to GPU DRAM, but with respect to on-chip scratchpad memory. Multigrid operations are optimized through localization and reorganized local operations in on-chip memory, achieving minimal global data transfer and a conflict free memory access pattern. Performance tests demonstrate that the optimized kernel is at least 2 times faster than the straightforward implementation for the Poisson problem, across various polynomial degrees in 2D and 3D, achieving up to 36% of the peak performance in both single and double precision on Nvidia A100 GPU.</description>

      <title>A segregated reduced order model of a pressure-based solver for turbulent compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides a reduced-order modelling framework for turbulent compressible flows discretized by the use of finite volume approaches. The basic idea behind this work is the construction of a reduced-order model capable of providing closely accurate solutions with respect to the high fidelity flow fields. Full-order solutions are often obtained through the use of segregated solvers (solution variables are solved one after another), employing slightly modified conservation laws so that they can be decoupled and then solved one at a time. Classical reduction architectures, on the contrary, rely on the Galerkin projection of a complete Navier-Stokes system to be projected all at once, causing a mild discrepancy with the high order solutions. This article relies on segregated reduced-order algorithms for the resolution of turbulent and compressible flows in the context of physical and geometrical parameters. At the full-order level turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity approach. Since there is a variety of different turbulence models for the approximation of this supplementary viscosity, one of the aims of this work is to provide a reduced-order model which is independent on this selection. This goal is reached by the application of hybrid methods where Navier-Stokes equations are projected in a standard way while the viscosity field is approximated by the use of data-driven interpolation methods or by the evaluation of a properly trained neural network. By exploiting the aforementioned expedients it is possible to predict accurate solutions with respect to the full-order problems characterized by high Reynolds numbers and elevated Mach numbers.</description>
