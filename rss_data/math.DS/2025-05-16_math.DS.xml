      <title>Dynamical zeta functions and resonance chains for infinite-area hyperbolic surfaces with large funnel widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantitatively relate the resonance sets of topologically finite infinite-area hyperbolic surfaces with no cusps to the resonance sets of certain metric graphs via the spine graph construction. In particular, we prove the existence of approximate resonance chains in resonance sets of these surfaces in the long-boundary-length regime. Our results are similar in spirit to those obtained in recent independent work by Li-Matheus-Pan-Tao, although our perspective and hypotheses are somewhat different. Our results also generalize older results obtained for three-funneled spheres by Weich. We primarily make use of transfer operators for holomorphic iterated function schemes, along with certain geometric bounds.</description>

      <title>A Topological and Operator Algebraic Framework for Asynchronous Lattice Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a novel mathematical framework integrating topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. I formalize stratified state spaces capturing multiple levels of synchronized behavior, define an asynchronous evolution metric that quantifies phase-offset distances between subsystems, and characterize emergent coherent topologies arising when subsystems synchronize. Within this framework, I develop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise conditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice. The main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of symmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony subspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem, demonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss hypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g. subshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator fields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry. Throughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of this work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing instead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Average measure theoretic entropy for a family of expanding on average random Blaschke products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work gives a computable formula for the average measure theoretic entropy of a family of expanding on average random Blaschke products, generalizing work by Pujals, Roberts and Shub [Expanding maps of the circle revisited: positive Lyapunov exponents in a rich family. $\textit{Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems.}$ $\textbf{26}(6)$ $(2006),$ $1931$-$1937$] to the random setting. In doing so, we describe the random invariant measure and associated measure theoretic entropy for a class of admissible random Blaschke products, allowing for maps which are not necessarily expanding and may even have an attracting fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a discrete-time phytoplankton-zooplankton model where the predator functional response and toxin distribution functions follow both Holling Type II and Holling Type III forms simultaneously. We analyze the types of fixed points and the global stability of the system. Additionally, we prove the occurrence of a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at the positive fixed point.

      <title>Stability and Bifurcation Analysis of a Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Model with Linear Functional Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the dynamics of a phytoplankton-zooplankton system with linear functional responses are examined. For the continuous-time model, the global asymptotic stability of the fixed points is demonstrated by constructing Lyapunov functions. For the discrete version of the model, both local and global dynamics are investigated using LaSalle's Invariance Principle. Furthermore, the occurrence of a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at the positive fixed point is established, and it is proved that the resulting invariant closed curve is attracting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we investigate directional entropy for semigroup actions generated by one-dimensional linear cellular automata (LCAs) and the shift transformation on the compact metric space $\mathbb{Z}_m^{\mathbb{N}}$. This work provides a systematic study of both \emph{topological directional entropy} (TDE) within Milnor's geometric framework and \emph{measure-theoretic directional entropy} via the Kolmogorov--Sinai formalism.</description>

      <title>Analysis of non-linear fractal functions on PCF self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with (1) the construction of a general non-linear fractal interpolation function on PCF self-similar sets, (2) the energy and normal derivatives of uniform non-linear fractal functions, (3) estimation of the bound of box dimension of the proposed fractal functions on the Sierpinski gasket and the von-Koch curve. Here, we present a more general framework to construct the attractor and the functions on the PCF self-similar sets using the Edelstein contraction, which broadens the class of functions. En route, we calculate the upper and lower box dimensions of the graph of non-linear interpolant. Finally, we provide several graphical and numerical examples for illustration of the construction and estimate the dimensions for different data sets.</description>

      <title>Smooth surface systems may contain smooth curves which have no measure of maximal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Borel probability measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets in a dynamical system. It is well known that higher smoothness of the map over smooth space plays important role in the study of invariant measures of maximal entropy. A famous theorem of Newhouse states that smooth diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds without boundary have invariant measures of maximal entropy. However, we show that the situation becomes completely different when we study measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets. Namely, we construct a smooth surface system which contains a smooth curve having no Borel probability measure of maximal entropy. Another evidence to show this difference is that, once an analytic set has one measure of maximal entropy, then the set has many measures of maximal entropy (no matter if we consider packing or Bowen entropy). For a general dynamical system with positive entropy $h_\mathrm{top}(T)$, we shall show that the system contains not only a Borel subset which has Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has entropy sufficiently close to $h_\mathrm{top}(T)$, but also a Borel subset which has no Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has entropy equal to the arbitrarily given positive real number which is at most $h_\mathrm{top}(T)$. We also provide in all $h$-expansive systems a full characterization for analytic subsets which have Borel probability measures of maximal entropy. Consequently, if let $Z\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be any analytic subset with positive Hausdorff dimension in Euclidean space, then the set $Z$ either has a measure of full lower Hausdorff dimension, or it can be partitioned into a union of countably many analytic sets $\{Z_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ with $\dim_{\mathcal{H}}(Z_i) &lt; \dim_{\mathcal{H}}(Z)$ for each $i$.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present a result established in [BGR24] where we prove that nonlinear Schrodinger equations on the circle, without external parameters, admit plenty of infinite dimensional non resonant invariant tori, or equivalently, plenty of almost periodic solutions. Our aim is to propose an extended sketch of the proof, emphasizing the new points which have enabled us to achieve this result.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Mean-Motion Resonances: Definitions, Widths, and Comparisons with Resonant Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lunar mean-motion resonances (MMRs) significantly shape cislunar dynamics beyond GEO, forming stable-unstable orbit pairs with corresponding intermingled chaotic and regular regions. The resonance zone is rigorously defined using the separatrix of unstable resonant periodic orbits surrounding stable quasi-periodic regions. Our study leverages the planar, circular, restricted three-body problem (PCR3BP) to estimate the (stable) resonance widths and (unstable) chaotic resonance zones of influence of the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs across various Jacobi constants, employing a Poincar\'e map at perigee and presenting findings in easily interpretable geocentric orbital elements. An analysis of the semi-major axis versus eccentricity plane reveals broader regions of resonance influence than those predicted by semi-analytical models based on the perturbed Kepler problem. A comparison with high-fidelity 3-dimensional ephemeris propagation of several spacecraft - TESS, IBEX, and Spektr-R - in these regions is made, which shows good agreement with the simplified CR3BP model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Chern-Hamilton energy functional on compact cosymplectic manifolds, fully classifying in dimension 3 those manifolds admitting a critical compatible metric for this functional. This is the case if and only if either the manifold is co-K\"ahler or if it is a mapping torus of the 2-torus by a hyperbolic toral automorphism and equipped with a suspension cosymplectic structure. Moreover, any critical metric has minimal energy among all compatible metrics. We also exhibit examples of manifolds with first Betti number $b_1 \geq 2$ admitting cosymplectic structures, but such that no cosymplectic structure admits a critical compatible metric.</description>

      <title>A Peter-Weyl theorem for compact group bundles and the geometric representation of relatively ergodic compact extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a relatively ergodic extension of measure-preserving dynamical systems has relative discrete spectrum if and only if it can be represented as a skew-product by a bundle of compact homogeneous spaces. Our result holds without restrictions on the acting group or the underlying probability spaces. This generalizes previous work by Mackey, Zimmer, Ellis, Austin, and the second author and Tao, and is inspired by the Furstenberg-Zimmer and Host-Kra structure theories for actions of uncountable groups. Our approach translates the ergodic-theoretic question into topological dynamics, where we establish a corresponding classification: an extension in topological dynamics has relative discrete spectrum precisely when it admits a skew-product representation by bundles of compact homogeneous spaces. A key step in our argument is establishing a Peter-Weyl-type theorem for bundles of compact groups which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and topology of the Hat family of tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered Hat tiling admits a 4-dimensional family of shape deformations, including the 1-parameter family already known to yield alternate monotiles. The continuous hulls resulting from these tilings are all topologically conjugate dynamical systems, and hence have the same dynamics and topology. We construct and analyze a self-similar element of this family called the CAP tiling, and we use it to derive properties of the entire family. The CAP tiling has pure-point dynamical spectrum, which we compute explicitly, and comes from a natural cut-and-project scheme with 2-dimensional Euclidean internal space. All other members of the Hat family, in particular the original version constructed from 30-60-90 right triangles, are obtained via small modifications of the projection from this cut-and-project scheme.</description>

Abstract: Orbit separation dimension (OSD), previously introduced as amorphic complexity, is a powerful complexity measure for topological dynamical systems with pure-point spectrum. Here, we develop methods and tools for it that allow a systematic application to translation dynamical systems of tiling spaces that are generated by primitive inflation rules. These systems share many nice properties that permit the explicit computation of the OSD, thus providing a rich class of examples with non-trivial OSD.</description>

      <title>Exploring localization in nonlinear oscillator systems through network-based predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized vibrations, arising from nonlinearities or symmetry breaking, pose a challenge in engineering, as the resulting high-amplitude vibrations may result in component failure due to fatigue. During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to detect an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples. The source code for this work is available.</description>

      <title>A Smooth, Recurrent, Non-Periodic Viscosity Solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation were introduced by Lions and Crandall. For Tonelli Hamiltonians, these solutions are generated by the Lax-Oleinik operator. It is known that this operator converges in the autonomous framework, but this convergence fails in the general cases. In this paper, we introduce a method to construct smooth, recurrent, non-periodic viscosity solutions on fixed compact manifolds $M$ of dimension 2 or higher. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of the non-wandering set of the Lax-Oleinik operator and identify its action on various omega-limit sets.</description>

Abstract: We consider solitary water waves on a rotational, unidirectional flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. Ovsyannikov has conjectured in 1983 that the solitary wave is uniquely determined by the Bernoulli constant, mass flux and by the flow force. This conjecture was disproved by Plotnikov in 1992 for the ir-rotational flow. In this paper we show that this conjecture is wrong also for rotational flows. Moreover we prove that in any neighborhood of the first bifurcation point on the branch of solitary waves, approaching the extreme wave, there are infinitely many pairs of solitary waves corresponding to the same Bernoulli constant. We give a description of the structure of this set of pairs. The proof is based on a bifurcation analysis of the global branch of solitary waves which is of independent interest.</description>
