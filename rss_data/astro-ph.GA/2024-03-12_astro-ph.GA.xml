      <title>Infrared Emission of Specific Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Molecules: Indene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules have long been suggested to be present in the interstellar medium (ISM). Nevertheless, despite their expected ubiquity and sustained searching efforts, identifying specific interstellar PAH molecules from their infrared (IR) spectroscopy has so far been unsuccessful. However, due to its unprecedented sensitivity, the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may change this. Meanwhile, recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in detecting specific PAH molecules (e.g., indene, cyanoindene, and cyanonaphthalene) through their rotational lines in the radio frequencies. As JWST holds great promise for identifying specific PAH molecules in the ISM based on their vibrational spectra in the IR, in this work we model the vibrational excitation of indene, a molecule composed of a six-membered benzene ring fused with a five-membered cyclopentene ring, and calculate its IR emission spectra for a number of representative astrophysical regions. This will facilitate JWST to search for and identify indene in space through its vibrational bands and to quantitatively determine or place an upper limit on its abundance.</description>

      <title>Cloud-by-cloud Multiphase Investigation of the Circumgalactic Medium of Low-redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pervasive presence of warm gas in galaxy halos suggests that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) is multiphase in its ionization structure and complex in its kinematics. Some recent state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy simulations predict an azimuthal dependence of CGM metallicities. We investigate the presence of such a trend by analyzing the distribution of gas properties in the CGM around 47 $z &lt;$ 0.7 galaxies from the Multiphase Galaxy Halos Survey determined using a cloud-by-cloud, multiphase, ionization modelling approach. We identify three distinct populations of absorbers: cool clouds ($T \sim$ 10$^{4.1}$ K) in photoionization equilibrium, warm-hot collisionally ionized clouds ($T \sim$ 10$^{4.5-5}$ K) affected by time-dependent photoionization, and hotter clouds ($T \sim$ 10$^{5.4-6}$ K) with broad OVI and Lya absorption consistent with collisional ionization. We find that fragmentation can play a role in the origin of cool clouds, that warm-hot clouds are out of equilibrium due to rapid cooling, and that hotter clouds are representative of virialized halo gas in all but the lowest mass galaxies. The metallicities of clouds do not depend on the azimuthal angle or other galaxy properties for any of these populations. At face value, this disagrees with the simplistic model of the CGM with bipolar outflows and cold-mode planar accretion. However, the number of clouds per sightline is significantly larger close to the minor and major axes. This implies that the processes of outflows and accretion are contributing to these CGM cloud populations, but that they are well mixed in these low redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Calibrate a Semi-analytic Model of the First Stars and Galaxies to the Renaissance Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method that calibrates a semi-analytic model to the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with high-redshift galaxy formation. This approach combines the strengths of semi-analytic techniques and hydrodynamical simulations, enabling the extension to larger volumes and lower redshifts inaccessible to simulations due to computational expense. Using a sample of Renaissance star formation histories (SFHs) from an average density region of the Universe, we construct a four parameter prescription for metal-enriched star formation characterized by an initial bursty stage followed by a steady stage where stars are formed at constant efficiencies. Our model also includes a treatment of Population III star formation where a minimum halo mass and log-normal distribution of stellar mass are adopted to match the numerical simulations. Star formation is generally well reproduced for halos with masses $\lesssim$$10^{9} M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. Between $11&lt;z&lt;25$ our model produces metal-enriched star formation rate densities (SFRDs) that typically agree with Renaissance within a factor of $\sim$2 for the average density region. Additionally, the total metal-enriched stellar mass only differs from Renaissance by about $10\%$ at $z \sim 11$. For regions that are either more overdense or rarefied not included in the calibration, we produce metal-enriched SFRDs that agree with Renaissance within a factor of $\sim$2 at high-$z$, but eventually differ by higher factors for later times. This is likely due to environmental dependencies not included in the model. Our star formation prescriptions can easily be adopted in other analytic or semi-analytic works to match our calibration to Renaissance.</description>

      <title>The XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP) II: The Multi-scale Temperature Structures in the Milky Way Hot Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the multi-scale temperature structures in the Milky Way (MW) hot gas, as part of the XMM-Newton Line Emission Analysis Program (X-LEAP), surveying the O VII, O VIII, and Fe-L band emission features in the XMM-Newton archive. In particular, we define two temperature tracers, $I_{\rm OVIII}/I_{\rm OVII}$ (O87) and $I_{\rm FeL}/(I_{\rm OVII}+I_{\rm OVIII})$ (FeO). These two ratios cannot be explained simultaneously using single-temperature collisional ionization models, which indicates the need for multi-temperature structures in hot gas. In addition, we show three large-scale features in the hot gas: the eROSITA bubbles around the Galactic center (GC); the disk; and the halo. In the eROSITA bubbles, the observed line ratios can be explained by a log-normal temperature distribution with a median of $\log T/{\rm K} \approx 6.4$ and a scatter of $\sigma_T \approx 0.2$ dex. Beyond the bubbles, the line ratio dependence on the Galactic latitude suggests higher temperatures around the midplane of the MW disk. The scale height of the temperature variation is estimated to be $\approx$2 kpc assuming an average distance of $5$ kpc for the hot gas. The halo component is characterized by the dependence on the distance to the GC, showing a temperature decline from $\log\,T/{\rm K}\,\approx\, 6.3$ to $5.8$. Furthermore, we extract the auto-correlation and cross-correlation functions to investigate the small-scale structures. O87 and FeO ratios show a consistent auto-correlation scale of $\approx$$ 5^\circ$ (i.e., $\approx$$ 400$ pc at 5 kpc), which is consistent with expected physical sizes of X-ray bubbles associated with star-forming regions or supernova remnants. Finally, we examine the cross-correlation between the hot and UV-detected warm gas, and show an intriguing anti-correlation.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies as a probe of a primordially magnetized Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The true nature of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) and their role in the formation of galaxies still remains elusive. To shed light on these unknowns, we investigate their impact by varying two sets of properties: (i) accounting for the effect of PMFs on the initial matter power spectrum, and (ii) accounting for their magneto-hydrodynamical effects on the formation of galaxies. By comparing both we can determine the dominant agent in shaping galaxy evolution. We use the magneto-hydrodynamics code RAMSES, to generate multiple zoom-in simulations for eight different host halos of dwarf galaxies across a wide luminosity range of $10^3-10^6\,L_{\odot}$. We explore a variety of primordial magnetic field (comoving) strengths ranging from $0.05$ to $0.50\,\mathrm{nG}$. We find magnetic fields in the interstellar medium not only modify star formation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies but also completely prevent the formation of stars in less compact ultra-faints with halo mass and stellar mass below $\sim 2.5\cdot10^9$ and $3\cdot10^6\,M_{\odot}$, respectively. At high redshifts, the impact of PMFs on host halos of dwarf galaxies through the modification of the matter power spectrum is more dominant than the influence of magneto-hydrodynamics in shaping their gaseous structure. Through the amplification of small perturbations ranging in mass from $10^7$ to $10^9\,M_{\odot}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM$+$PMFs matter power spectrum, primordial fields expedite the formation of the first dark matter halos, leading to an earlier onset and a higher star formation rate at redshifts $z&gt;12$.</description>

      <title>Search for radio halos in starburst galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starburst galaxies are undergoing intense episodes of star formation. In these galaxies, gas is ejected into the surrounding environment through winds created by the effect of hot stars and supernova explosions. When interacting with the intergalactic medium, these winds can produce strong shocks capable of accelerating cosmic rays. The radiation from these cosmic rays mainly occurs in radio and gamma rays. The radio halo can be characterized using the scale height. We searched for the presence of radio halos in a sample of edge-on starburst galaxies gathered from the MeerKAT 1.28 GHz Atlas of Southern Sources in the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample. We selected a sample of 25 edge-on galaxies from the original sample and modeled their disk and halo contributions. We have detected and characterized 11 radio halos, seven of which are reported here for the first time. We found that the halo scale heights increase linearly with the radio diameters and this relation does not depend on the star formation rate. All galaxies in our sample follow the radio-infrared relation with a q parameter value of $2.5\pm0.1$. The dependence of the halo luminosity on the star formation rate and the infrared luminosity supports the hypothesis that the radio halos are the result of synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons and points toward the fact that the star formation activity plays a crucial role in halo creation. The average scale height of 1 kpc implies a dynamical range of 4 Myr, several orders of magnitude greater than the synchrotron losses for electrons of 10 TeV. This suggests that some process must exist to reaccelerate cosmic rays in the halo if gamma-ray emission of a leptonic origin is detected from the halo. According to the relation between the radio and gamma-ray luminosities, we found that NGC 4666 is a potential gamma-ray source for future observations.</description>

      <title>ROME/REA: Three-year, Tri-color Timeseries Photometry of the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ROME/REA (Robotic Observations of Microlensing Events/Reactive Event Assessment) Survey was a Key Project at Las Cumbres Observatory (hereafter LCO) which continuously monitored 20 selected fields (3.76 sq.deg.) in the Galactic Bulge throughout their seasonal visibility window over a three-year period, between March 2017 and March 2020. Observations were made in three optical passbands (SDSS-g', -r', -i'), and LCO's multi-site telescope network enabled the survey to achieve a typical cadence of $\sim$10\,hrs in i' and ~15 hrs in g' and r'. In addition, intervals of higher cadence (&lt;1 hr) data were obtained during monitoring of key microlensing events within the fields. This paper describes the Difference Image Analysis data reduction pipeline developed to process these data, and the process for combining the photometry from LCO's three observing sites in the Southern Hemisphere. The full timeseries photometry for all 8 million stars, down to a limiting magnitude of i~18 mag is provided in the data release accompanying this paper, and samples of the data are presented for exemplar microlensing events, illustrating how the tri-band data are used to derive constraints on the microlensing source star parameters, a necessary step in determining the physical properties of the lensing object. The timeseries data also enables a wealth of additional science, for example in characterizing long-timescale stellar variability, and a few examples of the data for known variables are presented.</description>

      <title>Velocity Dispersion of the open cluster NGC 2571 by Radial Velocities and Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a Kernel Density Estimator method to evaluate the stellar velocity dispersion in the open cluster NGC 2571. We derive the 3-D velocity dispersion using both proper motions as extracted from Gaia DR3 and single epoch radial velocities as obtained with the instrument FLAMES at ESO VLT. The mean-square velocity along the line-of-sight is found to be larger than the one in the tangential direction by a factor in the interval [6,8]. We argue that the most likely explanation for such an occurrence is the presence of a significant quantity of unresolved binary and multiple stars in the radial velocity sample. Special attention should be paid to single line spectroscopic binaries (SB1) since in this case we observe the spectral lines of the primary component only, and therefore the derived radial velocity is not the velocity of the binary system center of mass. To investigate this scenario, we performed numerical experiments at varying the fractional abundance of SB1 in the observed sample. These experiments show that the increase of the mean-square radial velocity depends actually on the fractional abundance of SB1 to a power in the range of [0.39,0.45]. We used the 3-D velocity dispersion obtained by the dispersions in the tangential directions and the assumption that the radial velocity dispersion is the same as a tangential one to estimate the virial cluster mass and the cluster mass taking into account the gravitational field of the Galaxy and the non-stationarity of the cluster. These estimates are $650\pm30 \; M_\odot$ and $310\pm80 \; M_\odot$, respectively, and they are in substantial agreement with the photometric cluster mass.</description>

      <title>Estimating the mass of galactic components using machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The estimation of the bulge and disk massses, the main baryonic components of a galaxy, can be performed using various approaches, but their implementation tend to be challenging as they often rely on strong assumptions about either the baryon dynamics or the dark matter model. In this work, we present an alternative method for predicting the masses of galactic components, including the disk, bulge, stellar and total mass, using a set of machine learning algorithms: KNN-neighbours (KNN), Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Neural Network (NN). The rest-frame absolute magnitudes in the ugriz-photometric system were selected as input features, and the training was performed using a sample of spiral galaxies hosting a bulge from Guo's mock catalogue \citep{Guo-Catalog} derived from the Millennium simulation. In general, all the algorithms provide good predictions for the galaxy's mass components ranging from $10^9\,M_\odot$ to $10^{11}\,M_\odot$, corresponding to the central region of the training mass domain; however, the NN give rise to the most precise predictions in comparison to other methods. Additionally, to test the performance of the NN architecture, we used a sample of observed galaxies from the SDSS survey whose mass components are known. We found that the NN can predict the luminous masses of disk-dominant galaxies within the same range of magnitudes that for the synthetic sample up to a $99\%$ level of confidence, while mass components of galaxies hosting larger bulges are well predicted up to $95\%$ level of confidence. The NN algorithm can also bring up scaling relations between masses of different components and magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Insights into Galaxy Morphology and Star Formation: Unveiling Filamentary Structures around an Extreme Overdensity at $z \sim 1.5$ Traced by [OII] Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the morphological features and star formation activities of [OII] emitters in the COSMOS UltraDeep field at $z \sim 1.5$ using JWST NIRCam data from the COSMOS-Web survey and Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam. We also report the discovery of large filamentary structures traced by [OII] emitters, surrounding an extremely overdense core with a galaxy number density $\sim11\times$ higher than the field average. These structures span over 50 cMpc, underscoring their large scale in the cosmic web at this epoch. After matching the stellar mass distributions, the core galaxies show a higher frequency of disturbances (50$\%$ $ \pm$ 9$\%$) than those in outskirts (41$\%$ $ \pm$ 9$\%$) and the field (21$\%$ $ \pm$ 5$\%$), indicative of more frequent mergers and interactions in the innermost $\lesssim1.5 $ arcmin region. Additionally, we observe that specific star formation rates are elevated in denser environments. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test comparing the distribution of specific star formation rates of core and field galaxies yields a $\textit{p}$-value of 0.02, suggesting an enhancement of star-formation activity driven by the dense environment. Our findings underscore the environmental impact on galaxy evolution during a pivotal cosmic epoch and set the stage for further investigation with the increasing larger data from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Observational Properties of AGN Obscuration During the Peak of Accretion Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the gas obscuration and host galaxy properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) during the peak of cosmic accretion growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshift 0.8-1.8 using X-ray detected AGN with mid-infrared and far-infrared detection. The sample was classified as type-1 and type-2 AGN using optical spectral and morphological classification while the host galaxy properties were estimated with multiwavelength SED fitting. For type-1 AGN, the black hole mass was determined from MgII emission lines while the black hole mass of type-2 AGN was inferred from the host galaxy's stellar mass. Based on the derived parameters, the distribution of the sample in the absorption hydrogen column density ($N_{\rm H}$) vs. Eddington ratio diagram is examined. Among the type-2 AGN, $28\pm5$\% are in the forbidden zone, where the obscuration by dust torus cannot be maintained due to radiation pressure on dusty material. The fraction is higher than that observed in the local universe from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) data release 2 ($11\pm3$\%). The higher fraction implies that the obscuration of the majority of AGN is consistent with the radiation pressure regulated unified model but with an increased incidence of interstellar matter (ISM) obscured AGN. We discuss the possibility of dust-free absorption in type-1 AGN and heavy ISM absorption in type-2 AGN. We also find no statistical difference in the star-formation activity between type-1 and type-2 AGN which may suggest that obscuration triggered by a gas-rich merging is not common among X-ray detected AGN in this epoch.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

Abstract: We study the incidence and spatial distribution of galaxies that are currently undergoing gravitational merging (M) or that have signs of a post merger (PM) in six galaxy clusters (A754, A2399, A2670, A3558, A3562, and A3716) within the redshift range, 0.05$\lesssim$$z$$\lesssim$0.08. To this aim, we obtained Dark Energy Camera (DECam) mosaics in $u^{\prime}$, $g^{\prime}$, and $r^{\prime}$-bands covering up to $3\times R_{200}$ of the clusters, reaching 28 mag/arcsec$^2$ surface brightness limits. We visually inspect $u^{\prime}$$g^{\prime}$$r^{\prime}$ color-composite images of volume-limited ($M_r &lt; -20$) cluster-member galaxies to identify whether galaxies are of M or PM types. We find 4% M-type and 7% PM-type galaxies in the galaxy clusters studied. By adding spectroscopic data and studying the projected phase space diagram (PPSD) of the projected clustocentric radius and the line-of-sight velocity, we find that PM-type galaxies are more virialized than M-type galaxies, having 1--5% point higher fraction within the escape-velocity region, while the fraction of M-type was $\sim$10% point higher than PM-type in the intermediate environment. Similarly, on a substructure analysis, M types were found in the outskirt groups, while PM types populated groups in ubiquitous regions of the PPSD. Adopting literature-derived dynamical state indicator values, we observed a higher abundance of M types in dynamically relaxed clusters. This finding suggests that galaxies displaying post-merging features within clusters likely merged in low-velocity environments, including cluster outskirts and dynamically relaxed clusters.</description>

      <title>Relative velocities between $^{13}$CO structures within $^{12}$CO Molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity fields of molecular clouds (MCs) can provide crucial information on the merger and split between clouds, as well as their internal kinematics and maintenance, energy injection and redistribution, even star formation within clouds. Using the CO spectral lines data from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) survey, we measure the relative velocities along the line of sight ($\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$) between $^{13}$CO structures within $^{12}$CO MCs. Emphasizing MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures, we find that approximately 70$\%$ of $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ values are less than $\sim$ 1 km s$^{-1}$, and roughly 10$\%$ of values exceed 2 km s$^{-1}$, with a maximum of $\sim$ 5 km s$^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ with the internal velocity dispersion of $^{13}$CO structures ($\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$) and find that about 40$\%$ of samples in either double or triple regime display distinct velocity discontinuities, i.e. the relative velocities between $^{13}$CO structures are larger than the internal linewidths of $^{13}$CO structures. Among these 40$\%$ samples in the triple regime, 33$\%$ exhibit signatures of combinations through the two-body motion, whereas the remaining 7$\%$ show features of configurations through the multiple-body motion. The $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$ distributions for MCs with double and triple $^{13}$CO structures are similar, as well as their $\Delta$V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm ^{13}CO,in}$ distributions. This suggests that relative motions of $^{13}$CO structures within MCs are random and independent of cloud complexities and scales.</description>

      <title>Charting the main sequence of star-forming galaxies out to redshifts z~7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new determination of the star-forming main sequence (MS), obtained through stacking 100k K-band-selected galaxies in the far-IR Herschel and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) imaging. By fitting the dust emission curve to the stacked far-IR photometry, we derive the IR luminosities (LIR) and, hence, star formation rates (SFR) out to z~7. The functional form of the MS is found, with the linear SFR-M* relation that flattens at high stellar masses and the normalization that increases exponentially with redshift. We derive the corresponding redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and compare our findings with the recent literature. We find our MS to be exhibiting slightly lower normalization at z&lt;=2 and to flatten at larger stellar masses at high redshifts. By deriving the relationship between the peak dust temperature (Td) and redshift, where Td increases linearly from ~20K at z=0.5 to ~50 K at z=6, we conclude that the apparent inconsistencies in the shapes of the MS are most likely caused by the different dust temperatures assumed when deriving SFRs in the absence of far-IR data. Finally, we investigate the derived shape of the star-forming MS by simulating the time evolution of the observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF). While the simulated GSMF is in good agreement with the observed one, some inconsistencies persist. In particular, we find the simulated GSMF to be somewhat overpredicting the number density of low-mass galaxies at z&gt;2.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Morphologies Revealed with Subaru HSC and Super-Resolution Techniques II: Environmental Dependence of Galaxy Mergers at z~2-5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We super-resolve the seeing-limited Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images for 32,187 galaxies at z~2-5 in three techniques, namely, the classical Richardson-Lucy (RL) point spread function (PSF) deconvolution, sparse modeling, and generative adversarial networks to investigate the environmental dependence of galaxy mergers. These three techniques generate overall similar high spatial resolution images but with some slight differences in galaxy structures, for example, more residual noises are seen in the classical RL PSF deconvolution. To alleviate disadvantages of each technique, we create combined images by averaging over the three types of super-resolution images, which result in galaxy sub-structures resembling those seen in the Hubble Space Telescope images. Using the combined super-resolution images, we measure the relative galaxy major merger fraction corrected for the chance projection effect, f_merg, for galaxies in the ~300 deg^2-area data of the HSC Strategic Survey Program and the CFHT Large Area U-band Survey. Our f_merg measurements at z~3 validate previous findings showing that f_merg is higher in regions with a higher galaxy overdensity delta at z~2-3. Thanks to the large galaxy sample, we identify a nearly linear increase in f_merg with increasing delta at z~4-5, providing the highest-z observational evidence that galaxy mergers are related to delta. In addition to our f_merg measurements, we find that the galaxy merger fractions in the literature also broadly align with the linear f_merg-delta relation across a wide redshift range of z~2-5. This alignment suggests that the linear f_merg-delta relation can serve as a valuable tool for quantitatively estimating the contributions of galaxy mergers to various environmental dependences. This super-resolution analysis can be readily applied to datasets from wide field-of-view space telescopes such as Euclid and Roman.</description>

      <title>SMC-Last Extracted Photometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present point-source photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope's final survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We mapped 30 square degrees in two epochs in 2017, with the second extending to early 2018 at 3.6 and 4.5 microns using the Infrared Array Camera. This survey duplicates the footprint from the SAGE-SMC program in 2008. Together, these surveys cover a nearly 10 yr temporal baseline in the SMC. We performed aperture photometry on the mosaicked maps produced from the new data. We did not use any prior catalogs as inputs for the extractor in order to be sensitive to any moving objects (e.g., foreground brown dwarfs) and other transient phenomena (e.g., cataclysmic variables or FU Ori-type eruptions). We produced a point-source catalog with high-confidence sources for each epoch as well as combined-epoch catalog. For each epoch and the combined-epoch data, we also produced a more complete archive with lower-confidence sources. All of these data products will be available to the community at the Infrared Science Archive.</description>

      <title>The metallicity gradients of star-forming regions store information of the assembly history of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variations in metallicity and spatial patterns within star-forming regions of galaxies result from diverse physical processes unfolding throughout their evolutionary history, with a particular emphasis in recent events. Analysing MaNGA and \textsc{eagle} galaxies, we discovered an additional dependence of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) on metallicity gradients ($\nabla_{{\rm (O/H)}}$). Two regimes emerged for low and high stellar mass galaxies, distinctly separated at approximately ${\rm M_{\star}} &gt;10^{9.75}$.
  Low-mass galaxies with strong positive $\nabla_{{\rm (O/H)}}$ appear less enriched than the MZR median, while those with strong negative gradients are consistently more enriched in both simulated and observed samples. Interestingly, low-mass galaxies with strong negative $\nabla_{{\rm (O/H)}}$ exhibit high star-forming activity, regardless of stellar surface density or $\nabla_{{\rm (O/H)}}$. In contrast, a discrepancy arises for massive galaxies between MaNGA and \textsc{eagle} datasets. The latter exhibit a notable anticorrelation between specific star formation rate and stellar surface density, independent of $\nabla_{{\rm (O/H)}}$, while MaNGA galaxies show this trend mainly for strong positive $\nabla_{{\rm (O/H)}}$. Further investigation indicates that galaxies with strong negative gradients tend to host smaller central black holes in observed datasets, a trend not replicated in simulations. These findings suggest disparities in metallicity recycling and mixing history between observations and simulations, particularly in massive galaxies with varying metallicity gradients. These distinctions could contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Imaging of I Zw 18 by JWST: I. Strategy and First Results of Dusty Stellar Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging survey of I Zw 18, the archetypal extremely metal-poor, star-forming, blue compact dwarf galaxy. With an oxygen abundance of only $\sim$3% $Z_{\odot}$, it is among the lowest-metallicity systems known in the local universe, and is, therefore, an excellent accessible analog for the galactic building blocks which existed at early epochs of ionization and star formation. These JWST data provide a comprehensive infrared (IR) view of I Zw 18 with eight filters utilizing both NIRCam (F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W) and MIRI (F770W, F1000W, F1500W, and F1800W) photometry, which we have used to identify key stellar populations that are bright in the near- and mid-IR. These data allow for a better understanding of the origins of dust and dust-production mechanisms in metal-poor environments by characterizing the population of massive, evolved stars in the red supergiant (RSG) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phases. In addition, it enables the identification of the brightest dust-enshrouded young stellar objects (YSOs), which provide insight into the formation of massive stars at extremely low metallicities typical of the very early universe. This paper provides an overview of the observational strategy and data processing, and presents first science results, including identifications of dusty AGB star, RSG, and bright YSO candidates. These first results assess the scientific quality of JWST data and provide a guide for obtaining and interpreting future observations of the dusty and evolved stars inhabiting compact dwarf star-forming galaxies in the local universe.</description>

      <title>Time Delay of Light in the Gravitational lensing of Supermassive Black Holes in Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter halo has non-negligible effects on the gravitational lensing of supermassive black hole in the galaxy center. Our work gives a study on the time-delay of light in gravitational lensings of black holes enclosed by dark matter halos. To provide a precise description on the distribution of dark matter in galaxies, we choose several famous phenomenological dark matter halo models in astrophysics, including the NFW, Beta, Burkert and Moore models, to carry out the present study. Through numerically calculating the time-delay of light in gravitational lensing, a comparative analysis of the dark matter effects within different halo models has been performed. Assuming typical length scales associated with the galactic gravitational lensing, numerical results indicate that the NFW, Beta, Moore dark matter halos can significantly enhance the time delay of light. Conversely, the dark matter in Burkert model exhibits a negative contribution on the time delay, resulting in smaller time delay compared with those for pure black hole cases.

      <title>HINORA, a method for detecting ring-like structures in 3D point distributions I: application to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method - called HINORA (HIgh-NOise RANdom SAmple Consensus) - for the identification of regular structures in 3D point distributions. Motivated by the possible existence of the so called Council of Giants, i.e. a ring of twelve massive galaxies surrounding the Local Group in the Local Sheet with a radius of 3.75 Mpc, we apply HINORA to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue confirming its existence. When varying the lower limit of K-band luminosity of the galaxy entering the catalogue, we further report on the existence of another ring-like structure in the Local Volume that now contains the Milky Way and M31. However, this newly found structure is dominated by low-mass (satellite) galaxies. While we here simply present the novel method as well as its first application to observational data, follow-up work using numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation shall shed light into the origin of such regular patterns in the galaxy distribution. Further, the method is equally suited to identify similar (or even different) structures in various kinds of astrophysical data (e.g. locating the actual 'baryonic-acoustic oscillation spheres' in galaxy redshift surveys).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semi-major axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Radial Tully-Fisher relation and the local variance of Hubble parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the well-established Radial Tully-Fisher (RTF) relation observed in a `large' (843) sample of local galaxies, we report the maximum allowed variance in the Hubble parameter, $H_0$. We estimate the total intrinsic scatter in the magnitude of the RTF relation(s) implementing a cosmological model-independent cosmographic expansion. We find that the maximum allowed local variation in our baseline analysis, using 4 RTF relations in the galaxy sample is $\Delta H_0/H_0 \lesssim 3 \%$ at a $95\%$ C.L. significance. Which is implied form a constraint of $\Delta H_0/H_0 = 0.54^{+1.32}_{-1.37} \%$ estimated at $D_{\rm{L}}\sim 10\, [\rm{Mpc}]$. Using only one `best-constrained' radial bin we report a conservative $95\%$ C.L. limit of $\Delta H_0/H_0 \lesssim 4 \%$. Through our estimate of maximum variation, we propose a novel method to validate several late-time/local modifications put forth to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We find that within the range of the current galaxy sample redshift distribution $10 \, [\rm{Mpc}] \le D_{\rm{L}} \le 140\, [\rm{Mpc}]$, it is highly unlikely to obtain a variation of $\Delta H_0/H_0 \sim 9\%$, necessary to alleviate the $H_0$-tension. However, we also elaborate on the possible alternative inferences when the innermost radial bin is included in the analysis. Alongside the primary analysis of fitting the individual RTF relations independently, we propose and perform a joint analysis of the RTF relations useful to create a pseudo-standardizable sample of galaxies. We also test for the spatial variation of $H_0$, finding that the current samples' galaxies distributed only in the southern hemisphere support the null hypothesis of isotropy, within the allowed noise levels.</description>

      <title>Search for X/Z-shaped radio sources from TGSS ADR 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.07219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A small sub-class of radio galaxies that exhibit a pair of secondary low surface brightness radio lobes oriented at an angle to the primary high surface brightness lobes are known as X-shaped radio galaxies (XRGs). In cases, it is seen that the less luminous secondary lobes emerge from the edges of the primary high brightened lobes and give a Z-symmetric morphology. These are known as Z-shaped radio galaxies (ZRGs). From the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey at 150 MHz, we present a systematic search result for XRGs and ZRGs. We identified a total of 58 radio sources, out of which 40 are XRGs and 18 are ZRGs. Taking advantage of the large sample size of the XRGs and ZRGs reported in the current paper, different properties of XRGs and ZRGs are studied. Out of 58 XRGs and ZRGs presented in the current paper, 19 (32 per cent) are FR-I and 33 (57 per cent) are FR-II radio galaxies. For four XRGs and three ZRGs, the morphology is so complex that they could not be classified. We have estimated radio luminosity and spectral index of newly discovered winged radio galaxies and made a comparative study with previously detected XRGs and ZRGs. Most of the XRGs show a steep spectral index between 150 MHz and 1400 MHz and only 14 per cent of the sources show a flat spectrum but for ZRGs, a good fraction of the sources (36 per cent) show a flat spectrum.</description>

We have visually examined 5336 image fields and found 264 candidates for the tailed galaxy. Tailed radio galaxies are classified as Wide Angle Tailed (WAT) galaxies and Narrow-Angle Tailed (NAT) galaxies, based on the angle between the two jets of the galaxy. We found a sample of tailed radio galaxies which includes 203 `WAT' and 61 `NAT' type sources. These newly identified tailed sources are significant additions to the list of known tailed radio galaxies. The source morphology and luminosity features of the different candidate galaxies and their optical identifications are presented in the paper. Other radio properties and general features of the sources are also discussed.</description>

      <title>EMPRESS. XIII. Chemical Enrichments of Young Galaxies Near and Far at z ~ 0 and 4-10: Fe/O, Ar/O, S/O, and N/O Measurements with Chemical Evolution Model Comparisons</title>

Abstract: We present gas-phase elemental abundance ratios of 7 local extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) including our new Keck/LRIS spectroscopy determinations together with 33 JWST $z\sim 4-10$ star-forming galaxies in the literature, and compare chemical evolution models. We develop chemical evolution models with the yields of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), Type Ia supernovae, hypernovae (HNe), and pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and compare the EMPGs and high-$z$ galaxies in conjunction with dust depletion contributions. We find that high Fe/O values of EMPGs can (cannot) be explained by PISN metal enrichments (CCSN/HN enrichments even with the mixing-and-fallback mechanism enhancing iron abundance), while that the observed Ar/O and S/O values are much smaller than the predictions of the PISN models. The abundance ratios of the EMPGs can be explained by the combination of Type Ia SNe and CCSNe/HNe whose inner layers of argon and sulfur mostly fallback, which are comparable with Sculptor stellar chemical abundance distribution, suggesting that early chemical enrichment is taken place in the EMPGs. Comparing our chemical evolution models with the star-forming galaxies at $z\sim 4-10$, we find that the Ar/O and S/O ratios of the high-$z$ galaxies are comparable with those of the CCSNe/HNe models, while majority of the high-$z$ galaxies do not have constraints good enough to rule out contributions from PISNe. The high N/O ratio recently reported in GN-z11 cannot be explained even by rotating PISNe, but could be reproduced by the winds of rotating Wolf Rayet stars that end up as a direct collapse.</description>

      <title>EMPRESS. XIV. Strong High Ionization Lines of Young Galaxies at $z=0-8$: Ionizing Spectra Consistent with the Intermediate Mass Black Holes with $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^3-10^6\ M_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ionizing spectra estimated at 13.6--100 eV for ten dwarf galaxies with strong high ionization lines of He {\sc {ii}}$\lambda$4686 and [Ne {\sc{v}}]$\lambda$3426 ([Ne {\sc{iv}}]$\lambda$2424) at $z=0$ ($z=8$) that are identified in our Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and the literature (the JWST ERO program). With the flux ratios of these high ionization lines and $&gt;10$ low-ionization lines of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, neon, and sulfur, we determine ionizing spectra consisting of stellar and non-thermal power-law radiation by photoionization modeling with free parameters of nebular properties including metallicity and ionization parameter, cancelling out abundance ratio differences. We find that all of the observed flux ratios are well reproduced by the photoinization models with the power law index $\alpha_{\rm EUV}$ of $\alpha_{\rm EUV}\sim (-1)-0$ and the luminosity $L_{\rm EUV}$ of $L_{\rm EUV}\sim 10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at $\sim 55-100$ eV for six galaxies, while four galaxies include large systematics in $\alpha_{\rm EUV}$ caused by stellar radiation contamination. We then compare $\alpha_{\rm EUV}$ and $L_{\rm EUV}$ of these six galaxies with those predicted by the black hole (BH) accretion disk models, and find that $\alpha_{\rm EUV}$ and $L_{\rm EUV}$ are similar to those of the intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in BH accretion disk models {albeit with possibilities of the other scenarios.} Confirming these results with a known IMBH having a mass $M_{\rm BH}$ of $M_{\rm BH}=10^{5.75} \ M_\odot$, we find that four local galaxies and one $z=7.665$ galaxy have ionizing spectra consistent with those of IMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^3-10^5 \ M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Radio relics in massive galaxy cluster mergers in the TNG-Cluster simulation</title>

Abstract: Radio relics are diffuse synchrotron sources in the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters energized by the merger shocks. In this paper, we present an overview of the radio relics in massive cluster mergers identified in the new TNG-Cluster simulation. This is a suite of magnetohydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations of 352 massive galaxy clusters with $M_{\rm 500c}= 10^{14.0-15.3}\rm~M_{\odot}$ sampled from a 1 Gpc-size cosmological box. The simulations are performed using the moving-mesh code AREPO with the galaxy formation model and high numerical resolution consistent with the TNG300 run of the IllustrisTNG series. We post-process the shock properties obtained from the on-the-fly shock finder to estimate the diffuse radio emission generated by cosmological shockwaves for a total of $\sim300$ radio relics at redshift $z=0-1$. TNG-Cluster returns a variety of radio relics with diverse morphologies, encompassing textbook examples of double radio relics, single relics, and ``inverted" radio relics that are convex to the cluster center. Moreover, the simulated radio relics reproduce both the abundance and statistical relations of observed relics. We find that extremely large radio relics ($&gt;$ 2 Mpc) are predominantly produced in massive cluster mergers with $M_{\rm 500c}\gtrsim8\times10^{14}~\rm~M_{\odot}$. This underscores the significance of simulating massive mergers to study giant radio relics similar to those found in observations. We release a library of radio relics from the TNG-Cluster simulation, which will serve as a crucial reference for upcoming next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Star Formation and Dust in the Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale environment of the cosmic web is believed to impact galaxy evolution, but there is still no consensus regarding the mechanisms. We use a semi-analytic model (SAM) galaxy catalog to study the star formation and dust content of local galaxies in different cosmic environments of the cosmic web, namely voids, filaments, walls, and nodes. We find a strong impact of the environment only for galaxies with $M_{\rm stars}\lesssim10^{10.8}\, M_\odot$: the less dense the environment, the larger the star formation rate and dust content at fixed stellar mass. This is attributed to the fact that galaxies in less dense environments typically feature younger stellar populations, a slower evolution of their stellar mass and a delayed star formation compared to galaxies in denser environments. As for galaxies with $M_{\rm stars}\gtrsim 10^{10.8}\, M_\odot$ differences among environments are milder due to the disc instability (DI) driven supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth implemented in the SAM, which makes SMBH growth, and thus galaxy quenching, environment insensitive. We qualitatively test our predictions against observations by identifying environments in the SDSS-DR16 using dust masses derived from the GAMA survey. The agreement is encouraging, particularly at ${\rm log} \, M_{\rm stars}/M_\odot\gtrsim 10.5-11$, where sSFRs and dust masses appear quite environment-insensitive. This result confirms the importance of in situ growth channels of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Microlensing by Primordial Black Holes with The Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could explain some fraction of dark matter and shed light on many areas of early-universe physics. Despite over half a century of research interest, a PBH population has so far eluded detection. The most competitive constraints on the fraction of dark matter comprised of PBHs ($f_{\rm DM}$) in the $(10^{-9}-10)M_{\odot}$ mass-ranges come from photometric microlensing and bound $f_{\rm DM}\lesssim10^{-2}-10^{-1}$. With the advent of the Roman Space Telescope with its sub-milliarcsecond (mas) astrometric capabilities and its planned Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), detecting astrometric microlensing signatures will become routine. Compared with photometric microlensing, astrometric microlensing signals are sensitive to different lens masses-distance configurations and contains different information, making it a complimentary lensing probe. At sub-mas astrometric precision, astrometric microlensing signals are typically detectable at larger lens-source separations than photometric signals, suggesting a microlensing detection channel of pure astrometric events. We use a Galactic simulation to predict the number of detectable microlensing events during the GBTDS via this pure astrometric microlensing channel. Assuming an absolute astrometric precision floor for bright stars of 0.1 mas for the GBTDS, we find that the number of detectable events peaks at $\approx 10^{3} f_{\rm DM}$ for a population of $ 1 M_{\odot}$ PBHs and tapers to $\approx 10f_{\rm DM}$ and $\approx 100f_{\rm DM}$ at $10^{-4}M_{\odot}$ and $10^{3}M_{\odot}$, respectively. Accounting for the distinguishability of PBHs from Stellar lenses, we conclude the GBTDS will be sensitive to a PBH population at $f_{\rm DM}$ down to $\approx10^{-1}-10^{-3}$ for $(10^{-1}-10^{2})M_{\odot}$ likely yielding novel PBH constraints.</description>

      <title>First spiral arm detection using dynamical mass measurements of the Milky Way disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the vertical Jeans equation to the Milky Way disk, in order to study non-axisymmetric variations in the thin disk surface density. We divide the disk plane into area cells with a 100 pc grid spacing, and use four separate subsets of the Gaia DR3 stars, defined by cuts in absolute magnitude, reaching distances up to 3 kpc. The vertical Jeans equation is informed by the stellar number density field and the vertical velocity field; for the former, we use maps produced via Gaussian Process regression; for the latter, we use Bayesian Neural Network radial velocity predictions, allowing us to utilize the full power of the Gaia DR3 proper motion sample. For the first time, we find evidence of a spiral arm in the form of an over-density in the dynamically measured disk surface density, detected in all four data samples, which also agrees very well with the spiral arm as traced by stellar age and chemistry. We fit a simple spiral arm model to this feature, and infer a relative over-density of roughly 20 % and a width of roughly 400 pc. We also infer a thin disk surface density scale length of 3.3--4.2 kpc, when restricting the analysis to stars within a distance of 2 kpc.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Find the B\"ohm-Vitense gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the B\"ohm-Vitense gap, a gap in the colours of stars that occurs when the atmosphere changes from radiative to convective in deep layers. We are using different algorithms for detecting gaps in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), including the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) and UniDip algorithms. We propose using a combination of the k-NN algorithm and the UniDip algorithm and manual verification to identify gaps unlikely to be of a statistical origin. Using the $Gaia$ photometric system, i.e. BP-RP, we took the data of 130 star clusters and searched for gaps in the ranges of 0.40 to 0.47 mag, and 0.56 to 0.60 mag, respectively. We analysed all data statistically and identified the gaps in the individual clusters. Finally, we applied the kernel density estimator to see how the gaps are distributed.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Stellar and Gas-Phase Metallicities: Unveiling Insights for Stellar Feedback Modeling with Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metal content of galaxies provides a window into their formation in the full context of the cosmic baryon cycle. In this study, we examine the relationship between stellar mass and stellar metallicity (${\rm MZ}_*{\rm R}$) in the hydrodynamic simulations Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE to understand the global properties of stellar metallicities within the feedback paradigm employed by these simulations. Interestingly, we observe significant variations in the overall normalization and redshift evolution of the ${\rm MZ}_*{\rm R}$ across the three simulations. However, all simulations consistently demonstrate a tertiary dependence on the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of galaxies. This finding parallels the relationship seen in both simulations and observations between stellar mass, gas-phase metallicity, and some proxy of galaxy gas content (e.g., SFR, gas fraction, atomic gas mass). Since we find this correlation exists in all three simulations, each employing a sub-grid treatment of the dense, star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) to simulate smooth stellar feedback, we interpret this result as a fairly general feature of simulations of this kind. Furthermore, with a toy analytic model, we propose that the tertiary correlation in the stellar component is sensitive to the extent of the ``burstiness'' of feedback within galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual quasars, two active supermassive black holes at galactic scales, represent crucial objects for studying the impact of galaxy mergers and quasar activity on the star formation rate (SFR) within their host galaxies, particularly at cosmic noon when SFR peaks. We present JWST/MIRI mid-infrared integral field spectroscopy of J074922.96+225511.7, a dual quasar with a projected separation of 3.8 kilo-parsec at a redshift $z$ of 2.17. We detect spatially extended [Fe II] 5.34$\rm \mu$m and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 3.3$\mu$m emissions from the star formation activity in its host galaxy. We derive the SFR of 10$^{3.0\pm0.2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ using PAH 3.3$\mu$m, which is five times higher than that derived from the cutoff luminosity of the infrared luminosity function for galaxies at $z\sim2$. While the SFR of J0749+2255 agrees with that of star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass at the same redshifts, its molecular gas content falls short of expectations based on the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. This discrepancy may result from molecular gas depletion due to the longer elevated stage of star formation, even after the molecular gas reservoir is depleted. We do not observe any quasar-driven outflow that impacts PAH and [Fe II] in the host galaxy based on the spatially resolved maps. From the expected flux in PAH-based star formation, the [Fe II] line likely originates from the star-forming regions in the host galaxy. Our study highlights the stardust nature of J0749+2255, indicating a potential connection between the dual quasar phase and intense star formation activities.</description>

      <title>Changing-Look AGNs -- I. Tracking the transition on the main sequence of quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.10056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of preparing and analyzing spectral and other properties for a database of already discovered Changing-Look active galactic nuclei (CL AGNs). Here, we focus on the spectral fitting and analysis of broad emission lines in a sample of 93 CL AGNs collected from the literature with existing SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS spectroscopy where the H$\beta$ emission line profile does not completely disappear in any epochs. Additionally, we have gathered older/newer spectral epochs from all the available SDSS data releases to make the database more complete. We use PyQSOFit and perform a homogeneous spectral decomposition of all of our SDSS spectra and tabulate the AGN continuum and emission line properties per epoch per source, chronologically. This further allows us to categorize the sources in our sample as \textit{Turn-On} or \textit{Turn-Off} and subsequently check for repeated occurrences of such phases. We then estimate the black hole mass (M$_{\rm BH}$) and the Eddington ratio (L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$) per epoch per source where the required parameters are available and well-estimated. We realize the movement of the source in the M$_{\rm BH}$ versus L$_{\rm bol}$/L$_{\rm Edd}$ plane allowing us to check for systematic changes in the source's fundamental properties. We then track their transition along the optical plane of the Eigenvector 1 (EV1) schema and categorize sources that either stay within the same Population (A or B) or make an inter-population movement as a function of spectral epoch. We also test the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) of a subset of our sample of CL AGNs as a function of time and AGN luminosity.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background in LISA from Unresolved White Dwarf Binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect a wide variety of gravitational wave sources in the mHz band. Some of these signals will elude individual detection, instead contributing as confusion noise to one of several stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) -- notably including the `Galactic foreground', a loud signal resulting from the superposition of millions of unresolved double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) in the Milky Way. It is possible that similar, weaker SGWBs will be detectable from other DWD populations in the local universe, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use the Bayesian LISA Inference Package ($\tt{BLIP}$) to investigate the possibility of an anisotropic SGWB generated by unresolved DWDs in the LMC. To do so, we compute the LMC SGWB from a realistic DWD population generated via binary population synthesis, simulate four years of time-domain data with $\tt{BLIP}$ comprised of stochastic contributions from the LMC SGWB and the LISA detector noise, and analyze this data with $\tt{BLIP}$'s spherical harmonic anisotropic SGWB search. We also consider the case of spectral separation from the Galactic foreground. We present the results of these analyses and show, for the first time, that the unresolved DWDs in the LMC will comprise a significant SGWB for LISA.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging constraints on dark matter substructure through a synthesis of strong lensing flux ratios and extended lensed arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a purely gravitational means to infer properties of dark matter halos and thereby constrain the particle nature of dark matter. Strong lenses sometimes appear as four lensed images of a background quasar accompanied by spatially-resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy encircling the main deflector (lensed arcs). We present methodology to simultaneously reconstruct lensed arcs and relative image magnifications (flux ratios) in the presence of full populations of dark matter subhalos and line-of-sight halos. To this end, we develop a new approach for multi-plane ray tracing that accelerates lens mass and source light reconstruction by factors of $\sim 100-1000$. Using simulated data with a cold dark matter (CDM) ground truth, we show that simultaneous reconstruction of lensed arcs and flux ratios isolates small-scale perturbations to flux ratios by dark matter substructure from uncertainties associated with the main deflector mass profile on larger angular scales. Relative to analyses that use only image positions and flux ratios to constrain the lens model, incorporating arcs strengthens likelihood ratios penalizing warm dark matter (WDM) with a characteristic suppression scale $m_{\rm{hm}} / M_{\odot}$ in the range $\left[10^7 - 10^{7.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{7.5} - 10^{8}\right]$, $\left[10^8 - 10^{8.5}\right]$, $\left[10^{8.5} - 10^{9}\right]$ by factors of $1.3$, $2.5$, $5.6$, and $13.1$, respectively, and the $95\%$ exclusion limit improves by 0.5 dex in $\log_{10} m_{\rm{hm}}$. The enhanced sensitivity to low-mass halos enabled by these methods pushes the observational frontier of substructure lensing to the threshold of galaxy formation, enabling stringent tests of any theory that alters the properties of dark matter halos.</description>
