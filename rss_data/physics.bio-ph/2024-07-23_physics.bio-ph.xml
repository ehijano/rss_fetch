      <title>Binding and dimerization control phase separation in a compartment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological cells exhibit a hierarchical spatial organization, where various compartments harbor condensates that form by phase separation. Cells can control the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the amount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While physical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation, they can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control mechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization amplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other. This nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides additional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving thermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells can regulate phase separation in their compartments.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Self-replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical model for a self-replicating mechanical system inspired by biological processes within living cells and supported by computer simulations. The model decomposes self-replication into core components, each of which is executed by a single machine constructed from a set of basic block types. Key functionalities such as sorting, copying, and building, are demonstrated. The model provides valuable insights into the constraints of self-replicating systems. The discussion also addresses the spatial and timing behavior of the system, as well as its efficiency and complexity. This work provides a foundational framework for future studies on self-replicating mechanisms and their information-processing applications.</description>

      <title>3D-printed axicon enables extended depth-of-focus intravascular optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in endoscopy is how to fabricate a small fiber-optic probe that can achieve comparable function to probes with large, complicated optics (e.g., high resolution and extended depth of focus). To achieve high resolution over an extended depth of focus (DOF), the application of needle-like beams has been proposed. However, existing methods using miniaturized needle beam designs fail to adequately correct astigmatism and other monochromatic aberrations, limiting the resolution of at least one axis. Here, we describe a novel approach to realize freeform beam-shaping endoscopic probes via two-photon direct laser writing, also known as micro 3D-printing. We present a design achieving approximately 8-micron resolution with a DOF of &gt;0.8 mm at a central wavelength of 1310 nm. The probe has a diameter of 0.25 mm (without the catheter sheaths) and is fabricated using a single printing step directly on the optical fiber. We demonstrate our device in intravascular imaging of living atherosclerotic pigs at multiple time points, as well as human arteries with plaques ex vivo. This is the first step to enable beam-tailoring endoscopic probes which achieve diffraction-limited resolution over a large DOF.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin equation for a tagged monomer in a Gaussian semiflexible polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the motion of a tagged monomer within a Gaussian semiflexible polymer model. We carefully derived the generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) that governs the motion of a tagged central monomer. This derivation involves integrating out all the other degrees of freedom within the polymer chain, thereby yielding an effective description of the viscoelastic motion of the tagged monomer. A critical component of our analysis is the memory kernel that appears in the GLE. By examining this kernel, we characterized the impact of bending rigidity on the non-Markovian diffusion dynamics of the tagged monomer. Furthermore, we calculated the mean-squared displacement of the tagged monomer using the derived GLE. Our results not only show remarkable agreement with previously known results in certain limiting cases but also provide dynamic features over the entire timescale.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Membrane Dynamics Induced by Active Protein Interactions and Chemical Reactions: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomembranes wrapping cells and organelles are not only the partitions that separate the insides but also dynamic fields for biological functions accompanied by membrane shape changes. In this review, we discuss the spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations of membranes under nonequilibrium conditions. In particular, we focus on theoretical analyses and simulations. Protein active forces enhance or suppress the membrane fluctuations; the membrane height spectra are deviated from the thermal spectra. Protein binding or unbinding to the membrane is activated or inhibited by other proteins and chemical reactions, such as ATP hydrolysis. Such active binding processes can induce traveling waves, Turing patterns, and membrane morphological changes. They can be represented by the continuum reaction-diffusion equations and discrete lattice/particle models with state flips. The effects of structural changes in amphiphilic molecules on the molecular-assembly structures are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale cuticle density variations correlate with pigmentation and color in butterfly wing scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How pigment distribution correlates with cuticle density within a microscopic butterfly wing scale, and how both impact final reflected color remains unknown. We used ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to quantitatively determine, at nanoscale resolutions, the three-dimensional mass density of scales with pigmentation differences. By comparing cuticle densities between pairs of scales with pigmentation differences, we determine that the density of the lower lamina is inversely correlated with pigmentation. In the upper lamina structure, low pigment levels also correlate with sheet-like chitin structures as opposed to rod-like structures. Within each scale, we determine that the lower lamina in all scales has the highest density and distinct layers within the lower lamina help explain reflected color. We hypothesize that pigments, in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and refractive index, thereby impacting reflected wavelengths that produce colors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of autopoietic vesicles able to grow, repair and reproduce in a minimalist particle system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a 2D particle system in which autopoietic vesicles that are able to grow, repair, and reproduce can emerge from an initial random distribution of individual components. The reproduction process also exhibits inheritance of the vesicle content that could in principle change from one generation to the next and influence fitness, making those autopoietic vesicles eligible to be acted upon by natural selection.

      <title>A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization, we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Multicell-Fold: geometric learning in folding multicellular life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells fold into specific structures, is a central question in biology that defines how living organisms form. Establishing tissue-level morphology critically relies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its neighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over time during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a geometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and embryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks. We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D morphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements before they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation map and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction networks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for embryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study morphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power of geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of cells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic morphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as embryogenesis.</description>
