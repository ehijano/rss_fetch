      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of the Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum geometric contribution to the intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) for a general multiband Hamiltonian. The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\text{Yb}_3\text{Pt}_4$, $\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\text{CoNb}_3\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\text{MnNb}_3\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.</description>

      <title>A review of heat transport in solvated gold nanoparticles: Molecular dynamics modeling and experimental perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turning gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into nanoscale heat sources via light irradiation has prompted significant research interest, particularly for biomedical applications over the past few decades. The AuNP's tunable photothermal effect, notable biocompatibility, and ability to serve as vehicles for temperature-sensitive chemical linkers enable thermo-therapeutics, such as localized drug/gene delivery and thermal ablation of cancerous tissue. Thermal transport in aqueous AuNP solutions stands as the fundamental challenge to developing targeted thermal therapies; thus, this review article surveys recent advancements in our understanding of heat transfer and surface chemistry in AuNPs, with a particular focus on thermal boundary conductance across gold- and functionalized-gold-water interfaces. This review article highlights computational advances based on molecular dynamics simulations that offer valuable insights into nanoscopic interfacial heat transfer in solvated interfaces, particularly for chemically functionalized AuNPs. Additionally, it outlines current experimental techniques for measuring interfacial thermal transport, their limitations, and potential pathways to improve sensitivity. This review further examines computational methodologies to guide the accurate modeling of solvated gold interfaces. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of future research directions aimed at deepening our understanding of interfacial heat transfer in solvated AuNPs, crucial to optimize thermoplasmonic applications.</description>

      <title>Physisorption on Nanomechanical Resonators: The Overlooked Influence of Trace Moisture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short gas pulses introduced in a vacuum chamber have long been utilized to showcase the ultra-low mass resolutions achievable with nanomechanical resonators. The resonance frequency shifts are used as evidence of gas adsorption. However, there is very little clarity as to what exactly is adsorbing on to the resonators. We demonstrate that the physisorption of gases on cantilevers is predominantly the effect of moisture content that is present even in ultra-high purity gases. The experimental work is performed at low temperatures and in a high vacuum and is supported by theoretical calculations and simulation.</description>

      <title>States decoupled from the surface in short Si atomic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze both the stationary and time-dependent properties of molecular states in atomic chains on a surface, some of which are composed of atomic states decoupled from the substrate - a phenomenon analogous to dark states in quantum dot systems. To illustrate this effect at the atomic scale, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments on short silicon chains fabricated on a Si(553)-Au surface. In contrast to quantum dots, which typically involve characteristic energies in the meV range or lower, the atomic chains studied here operate in a high-energy regime, with energies in the eV range. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the local density of states of the chains carries clear signatures of these decoupled states, which significantly affect STM imaging. The topography becomes highly sensitive to the bias polarity, to the extent that some atomic sites may appear nearly invisible to the STM tip. Our time-resolved theoretical analysis reveals that these decoupled states emerge over a finite time interval. This oscillatory dynamical evolution, primarily driven by nearest-neighbor interactions, suggests a universal relaxation mechanism that is largely insensitive to the length of the atomic chain.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in G and 2D Raman Modes of Twisted Bilayer Graphene Near the Magic Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of twist angle ($\theta_t$) in tailoring the physical properties of heterostructures is emerging as a new paradigm in two-dimensional materials. The influence of flat electronic bands near the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^{\circ}$) on the phononic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (t-BLG) is not well understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the G and 2D Raman modes of t-BLG samples with twist angles ranging from $\sim$0.3$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$3$^{\circ}$ using micro-Raman spectroscopy. A key finding of our work is the splitting of the G mode near the magic angle due to moir\'e potential induced phonon hybridization. The linewidth of the low-frequency component of the G mode (G$^-$), as well as the main component of the 2D mode, exhibits enhanced broadening near the magic angle due to increased electron-phonon coupling, driven by the emergence of flat electronic bands. Additionally, temperature-dependent Raman measurements (6-300 K) of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene sample ($\theta_t \sim$ 1$^{\circ}$) reveal an almost tenfold increase in phonon anharmonicity-induced temperature variation in both components of the split G mode, as compared to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene sample, further emphasizing the role of phonon hybridization in this system. These studies could be important for understanding the thermal properties of the twisted bilayer graphene systems.</description>

      <title>Towards a hybrid 3D transmon qubit with topological insulator-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits provide a versatile platform for studying quantum materials by leveraging precise microwave control and utilizing the tools of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Hybrid circuit devices incorporating novel quantum materials could also lead to new qubit functionalities, such as gate tunability and noise resilience. Here, we report experimental progress towards a transmon-like qubit made with a superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junction using exfoliated BiSbTeSe2. We present a design that enables us to systematically characterize the hybrid device, from DC transport of the S-TI-S junction, to RF spectroscopy, to full circuit QED control and measurement of the hybrid qubit. In addition, we utilize a high-quality-factor superconducting cavity to characterize material and fabrication-induced losses, thereby guiding our efforts to improve device quality.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of the pseudospin-3/2 Dirac-Weyl fermions in the double-barrier-modulated two-dimensional system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically solved the pseudospin-3/2 Dirac equation and investigated the electronic transport properties in the double-barrier modulated two-dimensional system. The probability current density operator is explicitly derived from the time-dependent pseudospin-3/2 Dirac equation, which paves way for investigation of the electronic transport properties of general pseudospin-$s$ Dirac-Weyl systems with $s$ an integer or half integer larger than 1. As a result of the double-cone band structure, the pseudospin-3/2 system has two incident channels for a single incident energy and incident angle pair. Similar to its counterparts of pseudospin-1/2 and pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl systems, the Klein tunneling and resonant tunneling effects in the transmission probability are numerically observed for incidence coming from both Dirac cones in the double-barrier-modulated pseudospin-3/2 system. In contrast to its pseudospin-1/2 and -1 counterparts, the Klein tunneling and resonant tunneling effects are differentiated into double-channel and single-channel incidences, corresponding to different regimes in the $E$-$k_y$ dispersion plane. Without a flat band, the super Klein tunneling effect of the pseudospin-1 Dirac-Weyl system does not occur in the pseudospin-3/2 system. Using the numerically obtained probability current density, the zero-temperature conductivity, shot noise, and Fano factor are calculated. As a combined result of double-channel incidence, Klein tunneling, and resonant tunneling, in comparison with its pseudospin-1/2 (graphene) and pseudospin-1 counterparts, the conductivity and shot noise in the pseudospin-3/2 double-barrier structure is enhanced. A Fano factor between 0.4 and 0.5 close to the Dirac point ${E_F}={V_0}$ is observed.</description>

      <title>Residual gauge theory for quanta of surface plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a gauge-theoretical framework to investigate the quanta of surface plasmons. Our formulation, based on quantum electrodynamics, highlights the importance of residual gauge symmetry. We emphasize that residual gauge symmetry, which imposes constraint equations on physical states, is fundamentally linked to Joule heating. This framework is applied to metals, semiconductors, and quantum Hall states, suggesting the presence of a latent transverse electric mode and that the quanta have the ability to maintain light-matter entanglement.</description>

      <title>Angular-momentum-selective nanofocusing with Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of surface plasmon polaritons on a magnetic Weyl semimetal conical tip. We show that the axion term in the effective electrodynamics modifies the surface plasmon polariton dispersion relation and allows all modes with a given sign of the orbital angular momentum to be focused at the end of the tip. This is in contrast with normal metals, in which only one mode can reach the end. We discuss how this orbital angular momentum nanofocusing expands the potential of technologies that use this degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Bimodal distribution of delay times and splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak in a double-barrier normal-superconductor junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a scattering theory of the proximity effect in a weakly disordered SININ junction (S = superconductor, I = insulating barrier, N = normal metal). This allows to relate the conductance and density of states of the junction to the scattering times $\tau$ (eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix). The probability density $P(\tau)$ has two peaks, at a short time $\tau_{\rm min}$ and a late time $\tau_{\rm max}$. The density of states at the Fermi level is the geometric mean of the two times. The splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak is given by $\hbar/\tau_{\rm max}$.</description>

      <title>Surface states and finite size effects in triple-fold semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple-fold or pseudospin-1 semimetals belong to a class of multi-fold materials in which linearly dispersive bands and flat bands intersect at the same point, forming triple-fold crossing points. We conduct an analytical investigation of topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and finite-size effects in three-dimensional (3D) triple-fold and doubly degenerate triple-fold semimetals in continuum low-energy models. Higher topological charge of the triple-fold crossing points leads to two Fermi arcs connecting the nodes. For a single triple-fold crossing point, we found that no term in the Hamiltonian with momentum-independent elements can open a gap, prompting us to consider a doubly-degenerate triple-fold fermion, where the gap can be opened by mixing the degenerate copies. Thin films of triple-fold semimetals allow for mixing between the surface and bulk states in addition to the discretization of energy levels of the latter.</description>

      <title>Neel Skyrmion interactions derived by their arrangement in regular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coarse-grained interactions between N\'eel skyrmions, stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling (iDMI), are studied through the properties of their hexagonal lattices by micromagnetic simulations. The interactions with the film edges are excluded by imposing periodic boundary conditions. The dependence of skyrmion size and interaction energy on the distance is derived. Two types of behavior are observed depending on the value of iDMI compared to the critical value Dc above which the skyrmion size diverges: For iDMI &lt; Dc the skyrmions acquire a finite size that saturates at maximum value independent of the skyrmion distance that corresponds to the one of the isolated skyrmion. This energy is above that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state. For iDMI &gt; Dc the skyrmions tend to increase in size to the extent that their neighboring skyrmions permit and finite size skyrmions can be stabilized only in arrays due to their mutual repulsion. These configurations have energy below that of the homogeneous ferromagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Specific-heat anomaly in frustrated magnets with vacancy defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by frustrated magnets and spin-liquid-candidate materials, we study the thermodynamics of a 2D geometrically frustrating magnet with vacancy defects. The presence of vacancies imposes constraints on the bulk spins, which freezes some of the degrees of freedom in the system at low temperatures. With increasing temperature, these constraints get relaxed, resulting in an increase in the system's entropy. This leads to the emergence of a peak in the heat capacity $C(T)$ of the magnet at a temperature determined by the concentration of the vacancy defects. To illustrate the emergence of such an anomaly, we compute analytically the heat capacity of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Ising model on the triangular lattice with vacancy defects. The presence of the vacancy leads to a peak in $C(T)$ at the temperature $T_\text{imp}=-6J/\ln n_\text{imp}$, where $J$ is the AFM coupling between the spins and $n_\text{imp}$ is the fraction of the missing sites.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Majorana modes to potential disorder in Fe chains on a superconducting Rashba alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana modes offer great potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation due to their topological protection. However, for superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrids, intrinsic disorder makes the unambiguous detection of Majorana modes difficult. Here, we construct 1D spin chains from individual Fe atoms on the Rashba surface alloy BiAg2/Ag(111) with proximity-induced superconductivity from a Nb(110) substrate. While the Fe chains exhibit perfect crystalline order, we observe nano-scale potential disorder of the BiAg2/Ag(111)/Nb(110) heterostructure by scanning tunneling microscopy. However, this does not prevent the emergence of zero-energy modes at both ends of the Fe chains, in agreement with tight-binding calculations showing that they are only found in the topologically non-trivial regime of the phase diagram. These Majorana modes are indeed robust against potential disorder.</description>

      <title>Multi-NARP Laser Driving Scheme for Multiplexed Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently developed NARP scheme for laser-triggered single-photon sources to the simultaneous excitation of multiple emitters with varying transition energies, laying the groundwork for wavelength-division multiplexing in quantum optical networks. Our Multi-NARP scheme does not rely on polarization filtering and thus enables the near-unity extraction efficiency of single photons from each quantum dot. Our approach also offers the advantages of robustness to variations in the laser pulse parameters and immunity to excitation-induced dephasing tied to electron-phonon coupling. We show that simultaneous triggering of at least 10 emitters is possible, enabling the development of high-bandwidth quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Imaging of microwave magnetic field orientation using continuous-wave experiments on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging of microwave magnetic fields with nano-scale resolution has interesting applications. Specifically, detecting the orientation of the microwave fields is useful in condensed matter physics and quantum control. However, most of the existing methods for microwave field imaging are limited to detecting the magnitude of the fields. Due to their small sensor size and favorable optical and spin properties, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly suitable for imaging dc and ac magnetic fields. The reported methods for detecting the orientation of microwave magnetic fields use pulsed Rabi frequency measurements. Here, we demonstrate imaging of the orientation of microwave magnetic fields by only using continuous-wave experiments on NV centers. This simplifies the sensor apparatus and is particularly advantageous in applications where pulsing of the target microwave field is not possible. The method requires static bias magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the quantization axis of NV centers. We detect the direction of an arbitrary microwave magnetic field using NV centers of two different orientations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the projection of the microwave fields onto a plane can be imaged using NV centers of single orientation. It can be straightforwardly implemented using a single NV center.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to nonlinear photoinduced currents in 2D superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a rectified steady-state supercurrent as a response to the photoexcited current of the quasiparticles constitutes the concept of a superconducting photodiode. This phenomenon occurs in a two-dimensional thin superconducting film with a built-in DC supercurrent that is exposed to a circularly polarized external electromagnetic field. The flow of a Cooper-pair condensate, resulting as a second-order photo-response in a direction transverse to the initially built-in supercurrent, represents a superconducting counterpart to the photogalvanic effect. In this paper, we examine the photodiode supercurrent by restoring gauge invariance within the mean-field BCS framework. To achieve this, we derive an impurity-sensitive BCS-interaction-induced correction to the vertex function by performing self-consistent calculations within the Keldysh Green's function technique. The resulting photodiode current can be utilized for spectroscopic analysis of typical relaxation times in superconducting films.</description>

      <title>2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model with static domain walls and quasiperiodic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a square lattice to first minutely analyze its spectra including zero energy states (ZES) and in-gap states both under periodic and open boundaries. Thereafter, a series of antiphase domain walls (DW), distributed along two orthogonal lines, are introduced in the lattice with SSH like hoppings and this causes the ZES to localize not only at the corners but also at the intersection of the lines of domain walls. In-gap states not only populate at the edges but also show finite amplitudes along the DW lines. A different scenario appears for a radially symmetric distribution of domain walls along a circle around a poit within the lattice. It produces in-gap states localized at the center of the DW circle while the ZES show localizations around it in a symmetric fashion in the square lattice. We also probe the effect of a diagonal quasiperiodic disorder on the spectra and eigen-states of the 2D SSH model. This gives localization of the states more with a stronger disorder. We calculate participation ratios of the states and their averages to demonstrate how such localization develops with disorder. Lastly we also elaborate further on the eigenvalue and eigenstates of a few periodically hopping modulated cases, previously outlined briefly in the article: Jour. Phys. Cond.-Mat.{\bf 36}, 065301 (2024) and also give an account of the changed features of the spectra as a result of the application of DWs there. Our findings on these various fronts can increase many-fold the visibility of this popular model and the outcomes can be utilized in many emerging fields like topological quantum information processing, for example, by designing topological shielding of various kinds.</description>

      <title>Superfluid stiffness bounds in time-reversal symmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry has been shown to make an important contribution to the superfluid stiffness of superconductors, especially for flat-band systems such as moir\'e materials. In this work we use mean-field theory to derive an expression for the superfluid stiffness of time-reversal symmetric superconductors at zero temperature by computing the energy of the mean-field ground state as a function of pairing momentum. We show that the quantum geometric contribution to superfluid stiffness is a consequence of broken Galilean invariance in the interaction Hamiltonian, arising from momentum-dependent form factors related to the momentum dependence of Bloch states. The effects of broken Galilean invariance are not fully parametrized by the quantum metric considered in previous work. We obtain general lower and upper bounds that apply to both continuum and lattice models and present numerical calculations of the precise value in several important cases. The superfluid stiffness of superconductivity in a Landau level saturates the lower bound and the superfluid stiffness of the other cases we consider is close to the general lower bound we derive. In multilayer rhombohedral graphene the geometric contribution is shown not to be the dominant contribution to the superfluid stiffness, despite the flat band behavior in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Finally, assuming contact interaction and uniform pairing, we show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the ``minimal quantum metric" introduced in previous work. We provide a continuum version of the minimal quantum metric and explain its physical origin.</description>

      <title>Plasmon Polaritons in Disordered Nanoparticle Assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer assemblies of metal nanoparticles can act as photonic structures, where collective plasmon resonances hybridize with cavity modes to create plasmon-polariton states. For sufficiently strong coupling, plasmon polaritons qualitatively alter the optical properties of light-matter systems, with applications ranging from sensing to solar energy. However, results from experimental studies have raised questions about the role of nanoparticle structural disorder in plasmon-polariton formation and light-matter coupling in plasmonic assemblies. Understanding how disorder affects optical properties has practical implications since methods for assembling low-defect nanoparticle superlattices are slow and scale poorly. Modeling realistic disorder requires large system sizes, which is challenging using conventional electromagnetic simulations. We employ Brownian dynamics simulations to construct large-scale nanoparticle multilayers with controlled structural order. We investigate their optical response using a superposition T-matrix method with 2-D periodic boundary conditions. We find that while structural disorder broadens the polaritonic stop band and the near-field hot-spot distribution, the polariton dispersion and coupling strength remain unaltered. To understand effects of nanoparticle composition, we consider assemblies with model particles mimicking gold or tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals. Losses due to higher damping in ITO nanocrystals prevent their assemblies from achieving the deep strong coupling of gold nanoparticle multilayers, although the former still exhibit ultrastrong coupling. We demonstrate that while computationally efficient mutual polarization method calculations employing the quasistatic approximation modestly overestimate the strength of the collective plasmon, they reproduce the polariton dispersion relations determined by electrodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Gibbs measures of disordered crystals up to the solid-liquid phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the configuration space and the Gibbs measure of thermally disordered condensed matter systems has been a long standing problem. The challenge is to avoid the Gibbs paradox, which forbids any ordering or labeling of the atoms. Our key observation is that the lattice of a thermally disordered condensed matter system, in either solid, liquid or gas phase, can be fully reconstructed from the Voronoi cells of the atoms alone, even if these Voronoi cells are disassembled and randomly scrambled. In the example of the crystalline phase of silicon, the statistics of the Voronoi cells reveals the existence of four, and only four, large facets that are present with probability one for all temperatures up to the solid-liquid melting line. These four largest facets, which separate nearest-neighboring atoms, can be also be used to reconstruct the lattice of the crystal. Hence, their collection supplies the optimal representation of the configuration of the crystal. We conjecture that the existence of Voronoi facets that, despite their large thermal fluctuations, survive with probability one up to the melting temperature, is the fundamental signature of the crystalline solid phase and therefore key to quantifying the Gibbs measure over the entire solid phase.</description>

      <title>Correlated Error Bursts in a Gap-Engineered Superconducting Qubit Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the roadblocks towards the implementation of a fault-tolerant superconducting quantum processor is impacts of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. Such impacts temporarily elevate the density of quasiparticles (QPs) across the device, leading to correlated qubit error bursts. The most damaging errors, $T_1$ errors, stem from QP tunneling across the qubit Josephson junctions (JJs). Recently, we demonstrated that this type of error can be strongly suppressed by engineering the profile of superconducting gap at the JJs in a way that prevents QP tunneling. In this work, we identify a new type of impact-induced correlated error that persists in the presence of gap engineering. We observe that impacts shift the frequencies of the affected qubits, and thus lead to correlated phase errors. The frequency shifts are systematically negative, reach values up to $3\,{\rm MHz}$, and last for $\sim 1\,{\rm ms}$. We provide evidence that the shifts originate from QP-qubit interactions in the JJ region. Further, we demonstrate that the shift-induced phase errors can be detrimental to the performance of quantum error correction protocols.</description>

      <title>First-principles prediction of altermagnetism in transition metal graphite intercalation compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the emergence of altermagnetism, a magnetic phase characterized by the coexistence of compensated spin ordering and momentum-dependent spin splitting, in graphite intercalation compounds (GICs), a prototypical material system long investigated for its tunable electronic and structural properties. Through first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that vanadium-intercalated stage-1 graphite compounds, exhibit inherent altermagnetic properties. The hexagonal crystal system and antiferromagnetic ordering of V atoms generate a magnetic space group that enforces alternating spin polarization in momentum space while maintaining zero net magnetization. The calculated band structure reveals robust altermagnetic signatures: along the high-symmetry direction, we observe a pronounced spin splitting of ~270 meV with alternating spin polarization. Crucially, the spin splitting exhibits minimal sensitivity to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, highlighting the dominance of exchange interactions over relativistic effects. From Monte Carlo simulations, we predict a magnetic transition temperature ($T_m$ ) of ~228 K, indicating stable magnetic ordering above liquid nitrogen temperatures. The combination of symmetry-protected spin textures, SOC-independent splitting, and elevated $T_m$ temperature makes V-GICs as a promising candidate for spintronic applications, particularly for zero-field spin-polarized current generation and topologically robust spin transport. As the first demonstration of carbon-based alternating magnetic systems, this work offers a design paradigm for engineering spin-polarized quantum states governed by crystalline symmetry constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important nonlinear effect in magnonics is the 3-magnon splitting where a high frequency magnon splits into two magnons of lower frequencies. Here, we study the 3-magnon splitting in spin wave conduits made from synthetic antiferromagnets. By combining inductive excitation, inductive detection, Brillouin Light Scattering imaging of the spin waves and analytical modeling based on conservation laws, we elucidate the nature of the spin waves involved in this process. We show in particular that low order optical spin waves propagating along the conduit can split in doublets of non-degenerate acoustic spin waves that have a standing wave character in the confined direction and unsymmetrical wavevectors in the direction of the spin wave conduit. Generally, several splitting channels run in parallel. The rules governing the three-magnon splitting and its interplay with the mode confinement have consequences for the applications in non-linear microwave signal processing based on spin waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultrafast response of iron lattice to sub-ps pulsed laser-induced heating has been investigated using time-resolved XRD in the partial melting regime. Strong electron-phonon coupling in Fe leads to rapid heating within 1-2 ps post laser-irradiation, followed by lattice expansion and melting on the 2-5 ps timescale. A tetragonal distortion of the remaining bcc-phase emerges at 6 ps and the unit-cell volume increases up to a value characteristic for the bcc-Fe phase. Under the experimental conditions, the bct-Fe remains metastable up to at least 60 ps, gradually relaxing toward the bcc phase without fully reverting. These findings provide new insight into the ultrafast dynamics, structural pathways, and stability of transient phases during the early stages of solid-solid phase transitions in bcc metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed at complex oxide interfaces offer a unique platform to engineer quantum nanostructures. However, scalable fabrication of locally addressable devices in these materials remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate an efficient fabrication approach by patterning narrow constrictions in a superconducting KTaO3-based heterostructure. The constrictions are individually tunable via the coplanar side gates formed within the same 2DEG plane. Our technique leverages the high dielectric permittivity of KTaO3 (epsilon_r ~ 5000) to achieve strong electrostatic modulation of the superconducting 2DEG. Transport measurements through the constriction reveal a range of transport regimes: Within the superconducting state, we demonstrate efficient modulation of the critical current and Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transition temperature at the weak link. Further tuning of the gate voltage reveals an unexpectedly regular Coulomb blockade pattern. All of these states are achievable with a side gate voltage |V_SG| &lt; 1 V. The fabrication process is scalable and versatile, enabling a platform both to make superconducting field-effect transistors and to study a wide array of physical phenomena present at complex oxide interfaces.</description>

Abstract: A caustic is a mathematical concept describing the beam formation when the beam envelope is reflected or refracted by a manifold. While caustics are common in a wide range of physical systems, caustics typically exhibit a reciprocal wave propagation and are challenging to control. Here, we utilize the highly anisotropic dispersion and inherent non-reciprocity of a magnonic system to shape non-reciprocal emission of caustic-like spin wave beams in an extended 200 nm thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film from a nano-constricted rf waveguide. We introduce a near-field diffraction model to study spin-wave beamforming in homogeneous in-plane magnetized thin films, and reveal the propagation of non-reciprocal spin-wave beams directly emitted from the nanoconstriction by spatially resolved micro-focused Brillouin light spectroscopy (BLS). The experimental results agree well with both micromagnetic simulation, and the near-field diffraction model. The proposed method can be readily implemented to study spin-wave interference at the sub-micron scale, which is central to the development of wave-based computing applications and magnonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits can exhibit quantized energy levels and long coherence times. Harnessing the anharmonicity offered by Josephson junctions, such circuits have been successfully employed as qubits, quantum limited amplifiers and sensors. Here, we consider superfluidity as the charge-neutral analogue of superconductivity. Both dissipationless mass flow and Josephson tunneling have been demonstrated in superfluid helium. We propose a quantum device, consisting of a superfluid weak link and a mechanical element. The superfluid motion in this device is quantized. The resulting discrete energy levels are resolvable at millikelvin temperatures essential to maintaining the superfluid state. Appropriate device engineering can yield the necessary nonlinearity to realize qubit functionality. Hence, this device can potentially operate as a charge-neutral, superfluid quantum bit with micron-sized dimensions and millisecond scale coherence time. We show that this quantum regime is within reach for a range of device designs.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Proximity Effect in Two-Dimensional Hole Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technology involving hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials is a promising avenue for engineering quantum devices for information storage, manipulation, and transmission. Proximity-induced superconducting correlations are an essential part of such devices. While the proximity effect in the conduction band of common semiconductors is well understood, its manifestation in confined hole gases, realized for instance in germanium, is an active area of research. Lower-dimensional hole-based systems, particularly in germanium, are emerging as an attractive platform for a variety of solid-state quantum devices, due to their combination of efficient spin and charge control and long coherence times. The recent experimental realization of the proximity effect in germanium thus calls for a theoretical description that is tailored to hole gases. In this work, we propose a simple model to describe proximity-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional hole gases, incorporating both the heavy-hole (HH) and light-hole (LH) bands. We start from the Luttinger-Kohn model, introduce three parameters that characterize hopping across the superconductor-semiconductor interface, and derive explicit intraband and interband effective pairing terms for the HH and LH bands. Unlike previous approaches, our theory provides a quantitative relationship between induced pairings and interface properties. Restricting our general model to an experimentally relevant case where only the HH band crosses the chemical potential, we predict the coexistence of $s$-wave and $d$-wave singlet pairings, along with triplet-type pairings, and modified Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Our results thus present a starting point for theoretical modeling of quantum devices based on proximitized hole gases, fueling further progress in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconducting proximity effect in hole-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor devices</title>

Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems have received a great deal of attention in the last few years because of their potential for quantum engineering, including novel qubits and topological devices. The proximity effect, the process by which the semiconductor inherits superconducting correlations, is an essential physical mechanism of such hybrids. Recent experiments have demonstrated the proximity effect in hole-based semiconductors, but, in contrast to electrons, the precise mechanism by which the hole bands acquire superconducting correlations remains an open question. In addition, hole spins exhibit a complex strong spin-orbit interaction, with largely anisotropic responses to electric and magnetic fields, further motivating the importance of understanding the interplay between such effects and the proximity effect. In this work, we analyze this physics with focus on germanium-based two-dimensional gases. Specifically, we develop an effective theory supported by full numerics, allowing us to extract various analytical expressions and predict different types of superconducting correlations including non-standard forms of singlet and triplet pairing mechanisms with non-trivial momentum dependence; as well as different Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit contributions. This, together with their precise dependence on electric and magnetic fields, allows us to make specific experimental predictions, including the emergence of f-type superconductivity, Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, and gapless regimes caused by large in-plane magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of cavity effects on the decay dynamics of an open magnonic system. The Purcell effect on the magnon oscillator decay is thoroughly examined for both driven and non-driven scenarios. Analytical conditions are determined to distinguish between strong and weak coupling regimes, corresponding to oscillatory and pure decay behaviors respectively. Additionally, our theory also predicts the decay of the photon mode within the cavity-magnonic open system, demonstrating excellent agreement with existing experimental data. Our findings and methodologies can provide valuable insights for advancing research in cavity magnonic quantum control, quantum information processing, and the development of magnonic quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Leveraging the higher harmonics content of the Josephson potential in a superconducting circuit offers a promising route in the search for new qubits with increased protection against decoherence. In this work, we demonstrate how the flux tunability of a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor Josephson junction based on a single full-shell nanowire enables this possibility. Near one flux quantum, $\Phi\approx \Phi_0=h/2e$, we find that the qubit system can be tuned from a gatemon regime to a parity-protected regime with qubit eigenstates localized in phase space in the $0$ and $\pi$ minima of the Josephson potential ($\cos 2\varphi_0$). Estimates of qubit coherence and relaxation times due to different noise sources are presented.</description>

      <title>Interface-Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room-Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological spin configurations, such as soliton-like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have emerged in recent years in both fundamental science and technological applications. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room-temperature is crucial for enabling these structures as long-range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation processes have encountered difficulties due to multi-step field training techniques and competitive interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multi-dimensional topological spin textures is desirable, as skyrmions form swirling, hedgehog-like spin structures in two dimensions, while hopfions emerge as their twisted three-dimensional counterparts. Here, we report the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion-hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modelling, the experimental observations of hopfion-skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. Our model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, all at ambient temperature. Our study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetically defined information carriers. These stable structures hold promise for ultralow-power and high-density information processing, paving the way for the next generation of topologically defined devices.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Dominance of the Orbital Hall Effect over Spin in Transition Metal Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inverse spin and orbital Hall effects in 19 transition metals using spin-pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance. Spin-to-charge conversion was measured in YIG/X(5), while orbital-to-charge conversion was probed in YIG/Pt(2)/X(5) heterostructures. Here, X represents the different transition metals. Surprisingly, the orbital contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the spin response, clarifying the challenge of disentangling these effects. Our results largely agree with first-principles predictions for spin and orbital Hall conductivities but reveal discrepancies in select materials. These findings emphasize the fundamental role of the orbital Hall effect, and position orbitronics as a pivotal frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Half-integer thermal conductance in the absence of Majorana mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.</description>

      <title>Lattice-tunable substituted iron garnets for low-temperature magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of nm-thick epitaxial films of iron garnets by physical vapor deposition has opened up exciting opportunities for the on-chip generation and processing of microwave signals encoded in magnons. However, iron garnet thin films suffer from demanding lattice-matching and stoichiometry requirements. Here a new approach to their synthesis is developed, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of iron garnet compositions based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides. By substituting a controlled proportion of iron with additional yttrium, Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality are obtained, combining a widely tunable lattice parameter and excellent magnetization dynamics. This enables iron garnet thin films suited for cryogenic applications, which have long remained impractical due to microwave losses caused by paramagnetic garnet substrates. Low-temperature ferromagnetic resonance confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetic losses for Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films lattice-matched to Y$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$ (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate. The Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates such as (Gd,Y)$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Ga$_{3}$O$_{12}$. Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also have ideal lattice matching to YSGG, demonstrating the versatility of this approach. This opens unprecedented options for cation substitutions in iron garnet films, offering a promising avenue to new properties and quantum magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 10$^{-7}$ W/cm$^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate an upconversion system that converts low-intensity (down to ~10-7 W/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. To enable high-resolution imaging, the upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarons have emerged as a powerful concept across many-fields in physics to study an impurity coupled to a quantum bath. The interplay between impurity physics and the formation of composite objects remains a relevant problem to understand how few- and many-body states are robust towards complex environments and polaron physics. In most cases, impurities are point-like objects. The question we address here is how quasiparticle properties are affected when impurities possess an internal structure. The simplest yet fundamental structure for the impurity is a dimer state. Here, we investigate the polaronic properties of a dimer dressed by the elementary excitations of a bosonic bath. We solve the two-body impurity-impurity problem to determine the position and broadening of the bound state and consider the polaron dressing using a field-theory approach. We demonstrate the emergence of different dressed dimer regimes, where polaron dressing drives a dimer from a well-defined to an ill-defined bound state.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of 2D moir\'e materials have opened opportunities for advancing condensed matter physics. However, the effect of 1D moir\'e potentials on topological and correlated phases remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal a sequence of trivial-to-topological transitions and periodic-moir\'e-spin density waves induced by the 1D commensurate moir\'e potentials for spin-1/2 fermionic atoms. Such reentrant topology from a trivial phase is absent without the moir\'e potential and can be understood as the renormalization of topological parameters by the moir\'e strength. We then unveil the critical exponent and localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates. The periodic spin density wave of many-body ground states is contributed by the moir\'e potential, and is enhanced by on-site interactions but suppressed by nearest-neighbor interactions. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moir\'e systems, and the realization of the proposed model is promising in near-future ultracold atom setups.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

Abstract: Atomic scale qubits, as may be realized in nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, offer the opportunity to study magnetic field noise with nanometer scale spatial resolution. Using these spin qubits, one can learn a great deal about the magnetic-field noise correlations, and correspondingly the collective-mode spectra, in quantum materials and devices. However, to date these tools have been essentially restricted to studying Gaussian noise processes -- equivalent to linear-response. In this work we will show how to extend these techniques beyond the Gaussian regime and show how to unambiguously measure higher-order magnetic noise cumulants in a local, spatially resolved way. We unveil two protocols for doing this; the first uses a single spin-qubit and different dynamical decoupling sequences to extract non-Markovian and non-Gaussian spin-echo noise. The second protocol uses two-qubit coincidence measurements to study spatially non-local cumulants in the magnetic noise. We then demonstrate the utility of these protocols by considering a model of a bath of non-interacting two-level systems, as well as a model involving spatially correlated magnetic fluctuations near a second-order Ising phase transition. In both cases, we highlight how this technique can be used to measure in a real many-body system how fluctuation dynamics converge towards the central limit theorem as a function of effective bath size. We then conclude by discussing some promising applications and extensions of this method.</description>

Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23095</link>

Abstract: An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.</description>

      <title>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>

Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>
