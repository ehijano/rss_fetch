      <title>Stability of stationary states for mean field models with multichromatic interaction potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weakly interacting diffusions on the torus, for multichromatic interaction potentials. We consider interaction potentials that are not H-stable, leading to phase transitions in the mean field limit. We show that the mean field dynamics can exhibit multipeak stationary states, where the number of peaks is related to the number of nonzero Fourier modes of the interaction. We also consider the effect of a confining potential on the structure of non-uniform steady states. We approach the problem by means of analysis, perturbation theory and numerical simulations for the interacting particle systems and the PDEs.</description>

      <title>Conformal integrals in all dimensions as GKZ hypergeometric functions and Clifford groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17326v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euclidean conformal integrals for an arbitrary number of points in any dimension are evaluated. Conformal transformations in the Euclidean space can be formulated as the Moebius group in terms of Clifford algebras. This is used to interpret conformal integrals as functions on the configuration space of points on the Euclidean space, solving linear differential equations, which, in turn, is related to toric GKZ systems. Explicit series solutions for the conformal integrals are obtained using toric methods as GKZ hypergeometric functions. The solutions are made symmetric under the action of permutation of the points, as expected of quantities on the configuration space of unordered points, using the monodromy-invariant unique Hermitian form. Consistency of the solutions among different number of points is shown.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for super Yang-Mills on the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Nicolai maps for supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four and ten spacetime dimensions in the light-cone gauge, where the elimination of non-propagating degrees of freedom causes nonlocal and four-fermi interactions in the Lagrangian. The presence of the latter used to be an obstruction to the Nicolai map, which has recently been overcome at the price of quantum corrections to the map. No gauge-fixing or ghost terms arise in this formulation, since only physical transverse degrees of freedom occur. We present an explicit form of the Nicolai map to second order in the gauge coupling. In four dimensions, a `chiral' choice of the map leaves one of the two transverse gauge-field modes invariant, which forces the classical part of the map (on the other mode) to become a polynomial (quadratic in the gauge coupling, cubic in the gauge field)! In the power series expansion for the ten-dimensional map however, cancellations at each order in the coupling are systematic but incomplete, still leaving an infinite power series for the Nicolai map (on all eight transverse modes). Nevertheless, the existence of a polynomial variant is conceivable, also for the maximal ${\cal N}{=}\,4$ theory in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Magnetic Reconnection in Dynamically Evolving Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of three-dimensional (3D) numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the onset of magnetic reconnection via the tearing instability in dynamically thinning current sheets in the solar corona. In all our simulations, the onset of the non-linear tearing instability, which leads to the break-up of the thinning current sheet, does not occur until after the instability growth time becomes faster than the dynamic thinning time. Furthermore, as in previous 3D MHD simulations of static current sheets in the corona, for some parameters, the amount of magnetic shear is a fundamental switch-on parameter, which has consequences for coronal heating models. These results open up the possibility of using observable quantities of coronal current sheets to predict when they will break-up and release magnetic energy to power various energetic phenomena and/or heat the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for the accuracy of numerical simulation of pavement mechanics, the variational inequality model and its induced finite element method which can simulate the interlayer contact state becomes a potential solution. In this paper, a layer decomposition algorithm for solving variational inequality models of multi-layer elastic contact systems with interlayer Tresca friction conditions is studied. Continuous and discrete versions of the algorithm and their convergence theorems have been proposed and proved successively. Then, the algebraic form of the executable optimization algorithm and the numerical experimental results verify the practicability of the variational inequality model and its algorithm in the pavement mechanics modeling.</description>

Abstract: With the development of multi-layer elastic systems in the field of engineering mechanics, the corresponding variational inequality theory and algorithm design have received more attention and research. In this study, a class of equivalent saddle point problems with interlayer Tresca friction conditions and the mixed finite element method are proposed and analyzed. Then, the convergence of the numerical solution of the mixed finite element method is theoretically proven, and the corresponding algebraic dual algorithm is given. Finally, through numerical experiments, the mixed finite element method is not only compared with the layer decomposition method, but also its convergence relationship with respect to the spatial discretization parameter $H$ is verified.</description>

      <title>Bianchi I spacetimes in $f\left(Q\right)$-gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kasner spacetimes are exact solutions that are self-similar and of significant interest because they can describe the dynamic evolution of kinematic variables near the singularity of the Mixmaster universe. The chaotic behavior of the Mixmaster universe is related to the Kasner relations. This study investigates Kasner and Kasner-like solutions in symmetric teleparallel $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity. We consider three families of connections for the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker. We found that Kasner-like solutions are present in the theory when the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ vanishes. Kasner-like relations are introduced only for the field equations of the connection defined in the coincidence gauge. Finally, we perform a detailed phase-space analysis to understand the dynamics of $f\left( Q\right) $-gravity in the evolution of anisotropies and the effects of different connections on this evolution.</description>

      <title>Expected Lipschitz-Killing curvatures for spin random fields and other non-isotropic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical spin random fields are used to model the Cosmic Microwave Background polarization, the study of which is at the heart of modern Cosmology and will be the subject of the LITEBIRD mission, in the 2030s. Its scope is to collect datas to test the theoretical predictions of the Cosmic Inflation model. In particular, the Minkowski functionals, or the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, of excursion sets can be used to detect deviations from Gaussianity and anisotropies of random fields, being fine descriptors of their geometry and topology.
  In this paper we give an explicit, non-asymptotic, formula for the expectation of the Lipshitz-Killing curvatures of the excursion set of the real part of an arbitrary left-invariant Gaussian spin spherical random field, seen as a field on $SO(3)$. Our findings are coherent with the asymptotic ones presented in Carr\'on Duque, J. et al. "Minkowski Functionals in $SO(3)$ for the spin-2 CMB polarisation field", Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (2024). We also give explicit expressions for the Adler-Taylor metric, and its curvature. We obtain such result as an application of a general formula that applies to any nondegenerate Gaussian random field defined on an arbitrary three dimensional compact Riemannian manifold. The novelty is that the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures are computed with respect to an arbitrary metric, possibly different than the Adler-Taylor metric of the field.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for dipole symmetry and higher form foliated field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In accordance with recent progress of fracton topological phases, unusual topological phases of matter hosting fractionalized quasiparticle excitations with mobility constraints, new type of symmetry is studied -- multipole symmetry, associated with conservation of multipoles. Based on algebraic relation between dipole and global charges, we introduce a series of $(d+1)$-dimensional BF theories with $p$-form gauge fields, which admit dipole of spatially extended excitations, and study their physical properties. We elucidate that gauge invariant loops have unusual form, containing linear function of the spatial coordinate, which leads to the position dependent braiding statistics and unusual ground state degeneracy dependence on the system size. We also show that the theories exhibit a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between $p$-form and $(d-p)$-form dipole symmetries, which is canceled by an invertible theory defined in one dimensional higher via anomaly inflow mechanism.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. We further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via a degeneration of the Drinfeld presentation of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras; presentations for twisted current algebras are also provided. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our split twisted Yangians are isomorphic to the corresponding ones in RTT presentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moment quantities associated with the nonlinear Schrodinger equation offer important insights towards the evolution dynamics of such dispersive wave partial differential equation (PDE) models. The effective dynamics of the moment quantities is amenable to both analytical and numerical treatments. In this paper we present a data-driven approach associated with the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to numerically capture the evolution behaviors of such moment quantities. Our method is applied first to some well-known closed systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which describe the evolution dynamics of relevant moment quantities. Our examples are, progressively, of increasing complexity and our findings explore different choices within the SINDy library. We also consider the potential discovery of coordinate transformations that lead to moment system closure. Finally, we extend considerations to settings where a closed analytical form of the moment dynamics is not available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A practical method was proposed recently for finding local bifurcation points in an n-dimensional vector field F by seeking their 'underlying catastrophes'. Here we apply the idea to the homogeneous steady states of a partial differential equation as an example of the role that catastrophes can play in reaction diffusion. What are these 'underlying' catastrophes? We then show they essentially define a restricted class of 'solvable' rather than 'all classifiable' singularities, by identifying degenerate zeros of a vector field F without taking into account its vectorial character. As a result they are defined by a minimal set of r analytic conditions that provide a practical means to solve for them, and a huge reduction from the calculations needed to classify a singularity, which we will also enumerate here. In this way, underlying catastrophes seem to allow us apply Thom's elementary catastrophes in much broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of Particles Constrained to Spiral Curves with Application to Polyene Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Due to advances in synthesizing lower dimensional materials there is the challenge of finding the wave equation that effectively describes quantum particles moving on 1D and 2D domains. Jensen and Koppe and Da Costa independently introduced a confining potential formalism showing that the effective constrained dynamics is subjected to a scalar geometry-induced potential; for the confinement to a curve, the potential depends on the curve's curvature function.
  Method: To characterize the $\pi$ electrons in polyenes, we follow two approaches. First, we utilize a weakened Coulomb potential associated with a spiral curve. The solution to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions yields Bessel functions, and the spectrum is obtained analytically. We employ the particle-in-a-box model in the second approach, incorporating effective mass corrections. The $\pi$-$\pi^*$ transitions of polyenes were calculated in good experimental agreement with both approaches, although with different wave functions.</description>

Abstract: We reduce Yang-Mills equations for $SO^+(p,q)$, $Spin^+(p,q)$ and $SU(n)$ bundles, with constant and isotropic metrics, by developing the concept of $SO^+(p,q)$-equivariance. This allows us to model the electroweak interaction and $SO^+(p,q)$ bundles with a non-linear second order differential equation as well as the weak and strong interaction with a non-linear wave equation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit for a chain with thermal and mechanical boundary forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.08623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the hydrodynamic limit for a one dimensional harmonic chain with a random flip of the momentum sign. The system is open and subject to two thermostats at the boundaries and to an external tension at one of the endpoints. Under a diffusive scaling of space-time, we prove that the empirical profiles of the two locally conserved quantities, the volume stretch and the energy, converge to the solution of a non-linear diffusive system of conservative partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>The Lie Group Structure of Elliptic/Hyperelliptic $\wp$ Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generalized dual transformation for elliptic/hyperelliptic $\wp$ functions up to genus three. For the genus one case, from the algebraic addition formula, we deduce that the Weierstrass $\wp$ function has the SO(2,1) $\cong$ Sp(2,$\R$)/$\Z_2$ Lie group structure. For the genus two case, by constructing a quadratic invariant form, we find that hyperelliptic $\wp$ functions have the SO(3,2) $\cong$ Sp(4,$\R$)/$\Z_2$ Lie group structure. Making use of quadratic invariant forms reveals that hyperelliptic $\wp$ functions with genus three have the SO(9,6) Lie group and/or it's subgroup structure.</description>

      <title>On Groups in the Qubit Clifford Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we study the unitary groups that can be constructed using elements from the qubit Clifford Hierarchy. We first provide a necessary and sufficient canonical form that semi-Clifford and generalized semi-Clifford elements must satisfy to be in the Clifford Hierarchy. Then we classify the groups that can be formed from such elements. Up to Clifford conjugation, we classify all such groups that can be constructed using generalized semi-Clifford elements in the Clifford Hierarchy. We discuss a possible minor exception to this classification in the appendix. This may not be a full classification of all groups in the qubit Clifford Hierarchy as it is not currently known if all elements in the Clifford Hierarchy must be generalized semi-Clifford. In addition to the diagonal gate groups found by Cui et al., we show that many non-isomorphic (to the diagonal gate groups) generalized symmetric groups are also contained in the Clifford Hierarchy. Finally, as an application of this classification, we examine restrictions on transversal gates given by the structure of the groups enumerated herein which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bordered and Framed Toeplitz and Hankel Determinants with Applications to Integrable Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bordered and framed Toeplitz/Hankel determinants have the same structure as Toeplitz/Hankel determinants except in small number of matrix rows and/or columns. We review these structured determinants and their connections to orthogonal polynomials, collecting well-known and perhaps less well-known results. We present some applications for these structured determinants to ensembles of non-intersecting paths and the six-vertex model, with an eye towards asymptotic analysis. We also prove some asymptotic formulae for the probability of non-intersection for an ensemble of continuous time random walks for certain choices of starting and ending points as the number of random walkers tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Flat-band engineering of quasi-one-dimensional systems via supersymmetric transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to spectrally design quasi-one-dimensional crystal models described by the Dirac equation in the low-energy regime. The method is based on the supersymmetric transformation applied to an initially known pseudo-spin-1/2 model. This allows extending the corresponding susy partner so that the new model describes a pseudo-spin-1 system. The spectral design allows the introduction of a flat-band and discrete energies at will into the new model. The results are illustrated in two examples where the Su-Schriefer-Heeger chain is locally converted into a stub lattice.</description>

      <title>A misleading naming convention: de Sitter `tachyonic' scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of `tachyonic' scalar fields, characterized by a real negative squared `mass', in de Sitter (dS) spacetime. Through a rigorous group-theoretical analysis, we argue that labeling these fields as `tachyonic' lacks physical relevance, often leading to misinterpretations in scholarly discourse, as their `mass' parameter holds no genuine physical significance.</description>

      <title>Fidelity decay and error accumulation in quantum volume circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of fidelity decay and error accumulation in faulty quantum circuit models. Our work devises an analytical bound for the average fidelity between desired and faulty output states, accounting for errors that may arise during the implementation of two-qubit gates and multi-qubit permutations. It is shown that fidelity decays exponentially with both circuit depth and the number of qubits raised to an architecture-dependent power, and determine the decay rates as a function of the two types of errors. Furthermore, we establish a robust linear relationship between fidelity and the heavy output frequency used in Quantum Volume tests to benchmark quantum processors, under the considered errors protocol. These findings pave the way for predicting the behavior of fidelity in the presence of specific errors and offer insights into the best strategies for increasing Quantum Volume.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Steps of CyclePopping in Weakly Inconsistent U(1)-Connection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A U(1)-connection graph $G$ is a graph in which each oriented edge is endowed with a unit complex number, the latter being conjugated under orientation flip. We consider cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs), a particular kind of spanning subgraphs of $G$ that have recently found computational applications as randomized spectral sparsifiers. In this context, CRSFs are drawn from a determinantal measure. Under a condition on the connection, Kassel and Kenyon gave an elegant algorithm, named CyclePopping, to sample from this distribution. The algorithm is an extension of the celebrated algorithm of Wilson that uses a loop-erased random walk to sample uniform spanning trees. In this paper, we give an alternative, elementary proof of correctness of CyclePopping for CRSF sampling; we fill the gaps of a proof sketch by Kassel, who was himself inspired by Marchal's proof of the correctness of Wilson's original algorithm. One benefit of the full proof \`a la Marchal is that we obtain a concise expression for the law of the number of steps to complete the sampling procedure, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast. Furthermore, we show how to extend the proof to more general distributions over CRSFs, which are not determinantal. The correctness of CyclePopping is known even in the non-determinantal case from the work of Kassel and Kenyon, so our merit is only to provide an alternate proof. One interest of this alternate proof is again to provide the distribution of the time complexity of the algorithm, in terms of a Poisson point process on the graph loops, or equivalently as a Poisson process on pyramids of cycles, a combinatorial notion introduced by Viennot. Finally, we strive to make the connections to loop measures and combinatorial structures as explicit as possible, to provide a reference for future extensions of the algorithm and its analysis.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Braided scalar quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>
