      <title>Design and Performance Analysis of Hybrid FSO/THz Relay with Aerial RIS for Future NTN-Integrated 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of emerging sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are gaining prominence for their ability to intelligently control electromagnetic wave propagation and enhance backhaul communication performance. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-hop wireless network, where the first hop consists of a hybrid free-space optics (FSO) / terahertz (THz) link, and the second hop incorporates an aerial RIS-based radio frequency (RF) link. To provide a comprehensive performance evaluation, a comparative analysis of two switching strategies is conducted: (1) hard switching and (2) soft switching. Novel closed-form expressions are derived for key performance metrics, including outage probability and bit error rate. These expressions are then utilized to investigate the impact of various system parameters. Our proposed hybrid model demonstrates a 52.54% performance improvement over the traditional RF-FSO framework. Moreover, the integration of an aerial RIS in the second hop enhances system performance by 41.39%. Numerical findings suggest that strategically placing the aerial RIS at a lower altitude and maintaining an equal, shorter distance from both communication endpoints significantly improves overall system performance. To analyze the response under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, asymptotic analysis is performed, and the diversity order of the system is determined. Finally, the analytical results are validated through a Monte Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Tracing AG Codes: Toward Meeting the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the oldest problems in coding theory is to match the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with explicit binary codes. Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.
  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Policy-Guided MCTS for near Maximum-Likelihood Decoding of Short Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a policy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) decoder that achieves near maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD) performance for short block codes. The MCTS decoder searches for test error patterns (TEPs) in the received information bits and obtains codeword candidates through re-encoding. The TEP search is executed on a tree structure, guided by a neural network policy trained via MCTS-based learning. The trained policy guides the decoder to find the correct TEPs with minimal steps from the root node (all-zero TEP). The decoder outputs the codeword with maximum likelihood when the early stopping criterion is satisfied. The proposed method requires no Gaussian elimination (GE) compared to ordered statistics decoding (OSD) and can reduce search complexity by 95\% compared to non-GE OSD. It achieves lower decoding latency than both OSD and non-GE OSD at high SNRs.</description>

      <title>Color Multiset Codes based on Sunmao Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results on coding using multisets instead of ordered sequences. The study is motivated by a moving object tracking problem in a sensor network and can find applications in settings where the order of the symbols in a codeword cannot be maintained or observed. In this paper a multiset coding scheme is proposed on source data that can be organized as a flat or cyclic multi-dimensional integer lattice (grid). A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids. Moreover for a code of a given code set size and multiset cardinality, if we measure coding efficiency by the number of distinct symbols required, then braid codes have asymptotic order equal to those that are optimal. We also show that braid codes have interesting inherent error correction properties.</description>

      <title>Learning Binary Autoencoder-Based Codes with Progressive Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.</description>

      <title>Generic Construction of Optimal-Access Binary MDS Array Codes with Smaller Sub-packetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(k+r,k,l)$ binary array code of length $k+r$, dimension $k$, and sub-packetization $l$ is composed of $l\times(k+r)$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with every column of the matrix stored on a separate node in the distributed storage system and viewed as a coordinate of the codeword. It is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if any $k$ out of $k+r$ coordinates suffice to reconstruct the whole codeword. The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures. In this paper, given an arbitrary binary MDS array code with sub-packetization $m$ as the base code, we propose two generic approaches (Generic Construction I and II) for constructing binary MDS array codes with optimal access (or repair) bandwidth for single-node failures. For every $s\leq r$, a $(k+r,k,ms^{\lceil \frac{k+r}{s}\rceil})$ code $\mathcal{C}_1$ with optimal access bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction I. Repairing a failed node of $\mathcal{C}_1$ requires connecting to $d = k+s-1$ helper nodes, in which $s-1$ helper nodes are designated and $k$ are free to select. $\mathcal{C}_1$ generally achieves smaller sub-packetization and provides greater flexibility in the selection of its coefficient matrices. For even $r\geq4$ and $s=\frac{r}{2}$ such that $s+1$ divides $k+r$, a $(k+r, k,ms^{\frac{k+r}{s+1}})$ code $\mathcal{C}_2$ with optimal repair bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction II, with $\frac{s}{s+1}(k+r)$ out of $k+r$ nodes having the optimal access property. To the best of our knowledge, $\mathcal{C}_2$ possesses the smallest sub-packetization among existing binary MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth known to date.</description>

      <title>Enabling Smart Radio Environments in the Frequency Domain With Movable Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart radio environments (SREs) enhance wireless communications by allowing control over the channel. They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals.</description>

      <title>Computability of the Optimizer for Rate Distortion Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate distortion theory treats the problem of encoding a source with minimum codebook size while at the same time allowing for a certain amount of errors in the reconstruction measured by a fidelity criterion and distortion level. Similar to the channel coding problem the optimal rate of the codebook with respect to the blocklength is given by a convex optimization problem involving information theoretic quantities like mutual information. The value of the rate in dependence of the distortion level as well as the optimizer used in the codebook construction are of theoretical and practical importance in communication and information theory. In this paper the behavior of the rate distortion function regarding the computability of the optimizing test channel is investigated. We find that comparable with known results about the optimizer for other information theoretic problems a similar result is found to be true also regarding the computability of the optimizer for rate distortion functions.
  It turns out that while the rate distortion function is usually computable the optimizer for this problem is in general non-computable even for simple distortion measures.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.</description>

      <title>Compositional Distributed Learning for Multi-View Perception: A Maximal Coding Rate Reduction Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we formulate a compositional distributed learning framework for multi-view perception by leveraging the maximal coding rate reduction principle combined with subspace basis fusion. In the proposed algorithm, each agent conducts a periodic singular value decomposition on its learned subspaces and exchanges truncated basis matrices, based on which the fused subspaces are obtained. By introducing a projection matrix and minimizing the distance between the outputs and its projection, the learned representations are enforced towards the fused subspaces. It is proved that the trace on the coding-rate change is bounded and the consistency of basis fusion is guaranteed theoretically. Numerical simulations validate that the proposed algorithm achieves high classification accuracy while maintaining representations' diversity, compared to baselines showing correlated subspaces and coupled representations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Static Energy Efficient Design of Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.</description>

      <title>ROI-based Deep Image Compression with Implicit Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression has rapidly developed due to its ability to maintain high fidelity in important regions while reducing data redundancy. However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize implicit bit allocation for high-quality regionadaptive coding. Experiments on the COCO2017 dataset show that our implicit-based image compression method significantly outperforms explicit bit allocation approaches in rate-distortion performance, achieving optimal results while maintaining satisfactory visual quality in the reconstructed background regions.</description>

      <title>RIS-based Communication Enhancement and Location Privacy Protection in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the explosive advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the security of efficient UAV networks has become increasingly critical. Owing to the open nature of its communication environment, illegitimate malicious UAVs (MUs) can infer the position of the source UAV (SU) by analyzing received signals, thus compromising the SU location privacy. To protect the SU location privacy while ensuring efficient communication with legitimate receiving UAVs (RUs), we propose an Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (ARIS)-assisted covert communication scheme based on virtual partitioning and artificial noise (AN). Specifically, we design a novel ARIS architecture integrated with an AN module. This architecture dynamically partitions its reflecting elements into multiple sub-regions: one subset is optimized to enhance the communication rate between the SU and RUs, while the other subset generates AN to interfere with the localization of the SU by MUs. We first derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization with received signal strength (RSS), based on which, we establish a joint optimization framework for communication enhancement and localization interference. Subsequently, we derive and validate the optimal ARIS partitioning and power allocation under average channel conditions. Finally, tailored optimization methods are proposed for the reflection precoding and AN design of the two partitions. Simulation results validate that, compared to baseline schemes, the proposed scheme significantly increases the localization error of the SU by MUs while maintaining efficient communication between the SU and RUs, thereby effectively protecting the SU location privacy.</description>

Abstract: There is significant recent interest in designing new modulation schemes for doubly-selective channels with large delay and Doppler spreads, where legacy modulation schemes based on time-frequency signal representations do not perform well. In this paper, we develop a framework for analyzing such modulations using two characteristics -- non-selectivity and predictability -- which directly relate to the diversity and spectral efficiency that the modulations achieve. We show that modulations in the delay-Doppler, chirp and time-sequency domains are non-selective, predictable and equivalent to one another, whereas time-frequency modulations are selective and non-predictable.</description>

      <title>Pure-State Quantum Tomography with Minimal Rank-One POVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography seeks to reconstruct an unknown state from measurement statistics. A finite measurement (POVM) is \emph{pure-state informationally complete} (PSI-Complete) if the outcome probabilities determine any pure state up to a global phase. We study \emph{rank-one} POVMs that are minimally sufficient for this task. We call such a POVM \emph{vital} if it is PSI-Complete but every proper subcollection is not PSI-Complete.
  We prove sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in dimension \(n\): the size is at most \(\binom{n+1}{2}\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) and at most \(n^{2}\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), and we give constructions that attain these bounds. In the real case, we further exhibit a connection to block designs: whenever \(w \mid n(n-1)\), an \((n,w,w-1)\) design produces a vital rank-one POVM with \(n + n(n-1)/w\) outcomes. We provide explicit constructions for \(w=2,n-1\), and \(n\).</description>

      <title>Coexistence of eMBB+ and mMTC+ in Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of designing proper uplink multiple access schemes for coexistence between enhanced mobile broadband+ (eMBB+) users and massive machine-type communications+ (mMTC+) devices in a terminal-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Specifically, the use of a time-frequency spreading technique for the mMTC+ devices has been proposed. Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for Over-the-Air Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the increasing number of devices expected in next-generation networks, a shift to over-the-air (OTA) computing has been proposed. By leveraging the superposition of multiple access channels, OTA computing enables efficient resource management by supporting simultaneous uncoded transmission in the time and frequency domains. To advance the integration of OTA computing, our study presents a theoretical analysis that addresses practical issues encountered in current digital communication transceivers, such as transmitter synchronization (sync) errors and intersymbol interference (ISI). To this end, we investigate the theoretical mean squared error (MSE) for OTA transmission under sync errors and ISI, while also exploring methods for minimizing the MSE in OTA transmission. Using alternating optimization, we also derive optimal power policies for both the devices and the base station. In addition, we propose a novel deep neural network (DNN)-based approach to design waveforms that improve OTA transmission performance under sync errors and ISI. To ensure a fair comparison with existing waveforms such as raised cosine (RC) and better-than-raised-cosine (BTRC), we incorporate a custom loss function that integrates energy and bandwidth constraints along with practical design considerations such as waveform symmetry. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate performance gains of the designed pulse over RC and BTRC waveforms. To facilitate testing of our results without the need to rebuild the DNN structure, we also provide curve-fitting parameters for the selected DNN-based waveforms.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic lossless compression: Fundamental limits and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of variable-rate lossless data compression is considered, for codes with and without prefix constraints. Sharp bounds are derived for the best achievable compression rate of memoryless sources, when the excess-rate probability is required to be exponentially small in the blocklength. Accurate nonasymptotic expansions with explicit constants are obtained for the optimal rate, using tools from large deviations and Gaussian approximation. When the source distribution is unknown, a universal achievability result is obtained with an explicit ''price for universality'' term. This is based on a fine combinatorial estimate on the number of sequences with small empirical entropy, which might be of independent interest. Examples are shown indicating that, in the small excess-rate-probability regime, the approximation to the fundamental limit of the compression rate suggested by these bounds is significantly more accurate than the approximations provided by either normal approximation or error exponents. The new bounds reinforce the crucial operational conclusion that, in applications where the blocklength is relatively short and where stringent guarantees are required on the rate, the best achievable rate is no longer close to the entropy. Rather, it is an appropriate, more pragmatic rate, determined via the inverse error exponent function and the blocklength.</description>

      <title>A Compact Framework for Analyzing Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a compact framework for analyzing asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We derive an analytical expression for the fidelity of distributed entangled states, showing that the fidelity depends only on the total time all qubits spend in memory, rather than the individual memory times for each qubit. This result distills the complex dynamics of entanglement distribution into a compact accessible form, providing an scalable tool for evaluating protocol efficiency. Using this lightweight framework, we analyze the performance of parallel and sequential protocols, demonstrating that parallel distribution consistently outperforms sequential and highlighting the potential of parallel protocols for practical quantum network implementations.</description>
