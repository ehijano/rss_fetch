      <title>Non-uniform and anisotropic electric polarizability resulting in pronounced local repulsion minima in high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the dramatic effect of non-uniform, discrete electric polarizability in high-T$_{C}$ superconductors on the spatial fluctuations of the short to medium range Coulomb interactions through a real-space semiclassical model. Although this is a general property, we concentrate on the cuprates as parent compounds, in which the charge carriers are primarily concentrated on the O sublattice. The anisotropic effective Cu-O bond polarization caused by charge transfer energy modulation and the O$^{2-}$ atomic polarizability together generate a non-monotonic screened hole-hole Coulomb interaction at short distances that displays a local minimum at the in-plane second nearest neighbor O-O distance solely along the Cu-O bond direction. This is in accordance with the pseudogap phase anisotropy and the short coherence length observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field expulsion in optically driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent optical driving in quantum solids is emerging as a new research frontier, with many demonstrations of exotic non-equilibrium quantum phases. These are based on engineered band structures, and on stimulated nonlinear interactions between driven modes. Enhanced functionalities like ferroelectricity, magnetism and superconductivity have been reported in these non-equilibrium settings. In high-Tc cuprates, coherent driving of certain phonon modes induces a transient state with superconducting-like optical properties, observed far above T$_c$ and throughout the pseudogap phase. Questions remain not only on the microscopic nature of this phenomenon, but also on the macroscopic properties of these transient states, beyond the documented optical conductivities. Crucially, it is not clear if driven cuprates exhibit Meissner-like diamagnetism. Here, the time-dependent magnetic-field amplitude surrounding a driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$ sample is probed by measuring Faraday rotation in a GaP layer adjacent to the superconductor. For the same driving conditions that result in superconducting-like optical properties, an enhancement of magnetic field at the edge of the sample is detected, indicative of induced diamagnetism. The dynamical field expulsion measured after pumping is comparable in size to the one expected in an equilibrium type II superconductor of similar shape and size with a volume susceptibility $\chi_v$ of order -0.3. Crucially, this value is incompatible with a photo-induced increase in mobility without superconductivity. Rather, it underscores the notion of a pseudogap phase in which incipient superconducting correlations are enhanced or synchronized by the optical drive.</description>

      <title>Unconventional $s$-Wave Pairing with Point-Node-Like Gap Structure in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Universal low-temperature fluctuation of unconventional superconductors revealed: 'Smoking gun' leaves proper bosonic superfluidity the last theory standing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-temperature thermal fluctuations offer an essential window in characterizing the true nature of a quantum state of matter, a quintessential example being Fermi liquid theory. Here, we examine the leading thermal fluctuation of the superfluid density across numerous families ranging from relatively conventional to highly unconventional superconductors (MgB$_2$, bismuthates, doped buckyballs, heavy fermions, UTe$_2$, doped SrTiO$_3$, Chevrel clusters, intermetallics, organic superconductors, transition metal dichalcogenides, ruthenates, iron-pnictides, cuprates, and kagome metals). Amazingly, in all of them an unprecedented universal $T^3$ depletion materializes in the low-temperature superfluid density, even in the believed-to-be-conventional MgB$_2$. This reveals a new quantum superfluid state of matter and requires a necessary change of paradigm in describing modern superconductors. We demonstrate that such unorthodox yet generic behavior can be described by a proper particle-conserving theory of bosonic superfluidity hosting a long-lived `true condensate'.</description>

      <title>Quantized thermal and spin transports of dirty planar topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nontrivial bulk topological invariants of quantum materials can leave their signatures on charge, thermal and spin transports. In two dimensions, their imprints can be experimentally measured from well-developed multiterminal Hall bar arrangements. Here, we numerically compute the low temperature ($T$) thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$) and zero temperature spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall conductivities, and longitudinal thermal conductance ($G^{th}_{xx}$) of various prominent two-dimensional fully gapped topological superconductors, belonging to distinct Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, namely $p+ip$ (class D), $d+id$ (class C) and $p \pm ip$ (class DIII) paired states, in mesoscopic six-terminal Hall bar setups from the scattering matrix formalism using Kwant. In both clean and weak disorder limits, the time-reversal symmetry breaking $p+ip$ and $d+id$ pairings show half-quantized and quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ [in units of $\kappa_0=\pi^2 k^2_B T/(3h)$], respectively, while the latter one in addition accommodates a quantized $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ [in units of $\sigma^{sp}_0=\hbar/(8 \pi)$]. By contrast, the time-reversal invariant $p \pm ip$ pairing only displays a quantized $G^{th}_{xx}$ at low $T$ up to a moderate strength of disorder. In the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses ($\kappa_{xy}$, $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$, and $G^{th}_{xx}$) vanish. Possible material platforms hosting such paired states and manifesting these robust topological thermal and spin responses are discussed.</description>

      <title>Doped Holographic Superconductors in Gubser-Rocha model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a doped holographic superconductor in the Gubser-Rocha model, and realize a superconducting dome in the middle of the temperature-doping phase diagram. It is worth noting that unlike the previous researches, the profile of our dome shrinks inward near zero temperature. From the numerical observation for the coupling dependence of the phase diagram, we find that the coupling between the two gauge fields plays a crucial role in the formation of dome. We also analytically calculate the DC conductivity of the normal phase of the system in the momentum dissipation and obtain the resistivity which is proportional to temperature. The AC conductivity is calculated numerically.</description>

      <title>Discovery of universal phonon thermal Hall effect in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal Hall effect (THE) in insulator is a remarkable phenomenon that arises from the motion of chargeless quasi-particles under a magnetic field. While magnons or exotic spin excitations were considered as the origin of THE in some magnetic materials, there are more and more evidences suggesting that phonons play a significant role. However, the mechanism behind phonon THE is still unknown. Here we report the observation of THE, including planar THE, in a broad range of non-magnetic insulators and semiconductors: SrTiO3, SiO2 (quartz), MgO, MgAl2O4, Si and Ge. While the presence of antiferrodistortive domains in SrTiO3 and chiral phonons in SiO2 may complicate the interpretation of THE, the striking observations of THE in trivial insulators MgO and MgAl2O4, as well as in high-purity intrinsic semiconductors Si and Ge, demonstrate that phonon THE is a universal property of crystals. Without other effects on phonons such as from magnons, this universal phonon THE is characterized by a scaling law of |\k{appa}_xy| ~ \k{appa}_xx^2. Our results experimentally discover a fundamental physics of phonons in magnetic field, which should come from the direct coupling between atom vibrations and the field. Starting from this universal phonon THE in crystals, all previous interpretations of THE in magnetic or non-magnetic materials need to be reconsidered.</description>
