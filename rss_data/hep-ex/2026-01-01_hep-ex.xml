      <title>Addendum to multiplicities of charged pions, kaons and unidentified charged hadrons on an isoscalar target measured by COMPASS Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COMPASS Collaboration has recently published an article "Multiplicities of positive and negative pions, kaons, and unidentified hadrons from deep-inelastic scattering of muons off a liquid hydrogen target", Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 012002. In contrast to earlier COMPASS publications on similar topics, the aforementioned article features an enhanced treatment of QED radiative corrections, employing the DJANGOH Monte Carlo generator. This methodological improvement led to corrections that are up to 12% larger in the low-x, high-z region compared to the previously applied ones. To ensure consistent treatment of COMPASS data sets obtained using both isoscalar and proton targets, this paper presents an updated set of isoscalar multiplicities based on DJANGOH-derived radiative corrections. The present results supersede those published in Phys. Lett. B 764 (2017) 1 and Phys. Lett. B 767 (2017) 133.</description>

      <title>Prospect for measurement of CP-violating parameters of $B_s^0 \to \phi\gamma$ at the Tera Z factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $b \to s\gamma$ transition is a critical flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) process that could be used to probe CP violation (CPV) and new physics (NP). We quantify the anticipated precision for measuring $B_s^0 \to \phi\gamma$ at the CEPC Z pole operation, showing that the relative statistical uncertainty could be as low as 0.16\%, improved by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to existing measurements. Additionally, we perform a time-dependent analysis of the $B_s^0 \to \phi\gamma$ decay, accounting for $B_s^0/\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing extract the mixing-induced and CP-violating parameters $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{A}_{\phi\gamma}^\Delta}$, $\boldsymbol{C_{\phi\gamma}}$ and $\boldsymbol{S_{\phi\gamma}}$. Using central value from LHCb measurement as input, we evaluate the anticipated accuracy of measurements of these parameters. The projected statistical uncertainties are $\sigma_{A_{\phi\gamma}^{\Delta}{}^{\text{stat}}} = 0.021$, $\sigma_C^{\text{stat}} = 0.0092$ and $\sigma_S^{\text{stat}} = 0.0096$, and the systematic uncertainties are $\sigma_{A_{\phi\gamma}^{\Delta}{}^{\text{syst}}} = 0.035$, $\sigma_C^{\text{syst}} = 0.0027$ and $\sigma_S^{\text{syst}} = 0.0064$. Furthermore, the 1$\sigma$ sensitivity boundaries for NP in this study are found to be $\mathcal{A}_{\phi\gamma}^\Delta &lt; -0.05$ or $\mathcal{A}_{\phi\gamma}^\Delta &gt; 0.15$, $\mathcal{C}_{\phi\gamma} &lt; -0.02$ or $\mathcal{C}_{\phi\gamma} &gt; 0.04$, and $\mathcal{S}_{\phi\gamma} &lt; -0.04$ or $\mathcal{S}_{\phi\gamma} &gt; 0.04$. We also conduct a relevant detector optimization study by establishing the correlation between the anticipated precision and the intrinsic resolution of the ECAL, as well as the performance of the PID system.</description>

      <title>Thirty years after the discovery of the top quark: the field enters an age of refinement and subtlety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thirty years after the first observation of on-shell top quarks the investigation of the heaviest elementary particle remains a thriving field of basic research, as was illustrated by the 18th edition of the annual Workshop on Top-Quark Physics hosted by Hanyang University in Seoul, Korea. Observing new scattering processses involving top quarks, precision measurements of top-quark properties, and the usage of top quarks as a means of exploration remain key elements of research, but are most recently complemented by the observation of even more subtle effects based on the application of refined experimental techniques. This article summarises the most striking experimental results presented at the conference.</description>

      <title>Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into top and bottom quarks in lepton+jets final states in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is presented for charged Higgs bosons (H$^\pm$) in proton-proton (pp) collision events via the pp $\to$ (b)H$^\pm$ processes, with H$^\pm$ decaying into top (t) and bottom (b) quarks. The search targets final states with one lepton, missing transverse momentum, and two or more b jets. The analysis is based on data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. We search for charged Higgs bosons in the 200 GeV to 1 TeV mass range. The results are interpreted within the generalized two-Higgs-doublet model (g2HDM). This model predicts additional Yukawa couplings of the Higgs bosons to the top quark $\rho_\mathrm{tt}$, the top and charm quark $\rho_\mathrm{tc}$, and the top and up quark $\rho_\mathrm{tu}$. This search focuses on the real components of $\rho_\mathrm{tt}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{tc}$, which are probed up to values of unity. An excess is observed with respect to the standard model expectation with a local significance of 2.4 standard deviations for a signal with an H$^\pm$ boson mass ($m_{\mathrm{H}^\pm}$) of 600 GeV. Limits are derived on the product of the cross section $\sigma$(pp $\to$ (b)H$^\pm$) and branching fraction $\mathcal{B}$(H$^\pm$ $\to$ tb, t $\to$ b$\ell\nu$), where $\ell$ = e, $\mu$. The values of $\rho_\mathrm{tc} \gtrsim$ 0.15$-$0.5 are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the $m_{\mathrm{H}^\pm}$ and $\rho_\mathrm{tt}$ assumptions. The results represent the first search for charged Higgs bosons within the g2HDM framework and complement the existing results on additional neutral Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>Gedanken Experiments of Entanglement in Particle Physics: Interactions, Operators and Bell Inequalities in Flavor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we explore ideas from quantum entanglement which can be meaningfully formulated and tested in the collider environment. We propose Bell-type inequalities as operator-level diagnostics of quantum incompatibility in particle-physics systems. We construct flavor operators associated with mass identification, flavor change, and charged-current weak mixing which arise from fundamental interactions in the Standard Model. We treat these interactions as alternative measurement settings in a Gendanken experiment. For entangled two-particle states, these operators generate nontrivial correlations that violate Bell-type bounds, excluding non-contextual local descriptions under the stated assumptions. These violations arise from the algebraic structure of the operators rather than from kinematic correlations or exotic dynamics. We discuss how the predicted correlation patterns may be probed with experimental data, clarifying the scope and limitations of Bell-type reasoning in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Performance of an LYSO-Based Active Converter for a Photon Pair-Spectrometer aiming for 52.8 MeV photon detection in Future $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ Search Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For future $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ search experiments with a branching-ratio sensitivity of $10^{-15}$, we are developing a photon pair-spectrometer employing an active LYSO converter, aiming at target resolutions of 30 ps in timing and 200 keV in energy measurement for detecting 52.8 MeV photons. The converter generates electron-positron pairs from incident photons while simultaneously measuring their energy deposition and timing. On the basis of simulation studies, we optimized the converter thickness and segment dimensions, and accordingly fabricated prototype LYSO segments. Their single-MIP detection performance was evaluated using an electron beam at the KEK PF-AR test beamline. The prototypes exhibited excellent performance, achieving a time resolution of 25 ps and a light yield of $10^4$ photoelectrons, both substantially surpassing the design requirements.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi \Lambda $ femtoscopy and the nature of $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, numerous exotic hadron states have been discovered, yet their underlying nature remains unclear. It is widely acknowledged that understanding hadron-hadron interactions is essential to unraveling their properties. Hadron spectroscopy is a powerful tool for this endeavor, providing rich experimental data that can shed light on exotic systems. Recently, the LHCb experiment analyzed the process $B^{-} \rightarrow J/\psi \Lambda \bar{p}$ and observed a narrow peak in the $J/\psi \Lambda$ invariant mass spectrum, regarding it as a candidate for a pentaquark. In this work, we extract the coupled-channel $J / \psi \Lambda-\bar{D} \Xi_c-\bar{D}_s \Lambda_c$ potential based on the $J/\psi \Lambda$ invariant mass spectrum. Our results indicate the existence of a bound state below the $\bar{D} \Xi_c$ mass threshold, corresponding to the experimentally measured state $P_{cs}(4338)$. Furthermore, we predict the scattering lengths and momentum correlation functions for the $J/\psi \Lambda$ and $\bar{D}\Xi_c$ channels, which serve as theoretical references for future femtoscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing gluons-enriched dark jets from Higgs boson exotic decays at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark sector may possess a rich structure yet to be uncovered, and a QCD-like dark sector with GeV-scale dark hadrons can yield novel signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this work, we focus on a light singlet pseudoscalar mediator that connects the QCD-like dark sector to the Standard Model (SM) sector via the Higgs portal. Notably, when the lightest unstable dark meson has a mass of approximately $3$ GeV, it predominantly decays into a pair of gluons and behaves as a long-lived particle, a scenario that has received relatively little attention. We consider various Higgs production channels at the LHC and investigate two processes for generating dark mesons: (1) the cascade decay of the Higgs boson into a pair of light pseudoscalar mediators, which subsequently decay into four dark mesons; and (2) the dark shower and hadronization process whereby the Higgs boson decays into a pair of dark quarks that subsequently evolve into dark mesons. These processes give rise to novel gluon-rich dark jets composed of long-lived dark mesons. Notably, we find that appropriate trigger selection constitutes a crucial factor for detecting these signal signatures in both tracker system and CMS muon system. At the high-luminosity LHC, the exotic Higgs branching ratio to cascade decays (dark showers) can be constrained below $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-1})$ [$\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^{-2})$] for dark meson proper lifetimes $c\tau$ ranging from $1$ mm to $100$ m.</description>

      <title>Correlating Resonant Di-Higgs and Tri-Higgs Production to $H\to VV$ in the 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of resonant di-Higgs production, which would strongly suggest the existence of a new heavy neutral scalar $H$, has been searched for extensively at the LHC. In the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) with $m_H\gg m_h$, where $h$ is the Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV observed at the LHC, we show that a direct correlation between Br$(H\to hh)$ and Br$(H\to VV)$, with $V=Z,W$, emerges that depends only on $m_H$ (and $m_V$). In particular, for heavy scalar masses between 500\,GeV and 1\,TeV, we find that Br($H\to hh$)/ Br($H\to ZZ)\approx 9.5$. The origin of this prediction is most transparent in the Higgs basis, where the term in the scalar potential proportional to $\mathcal H_1^\dagger \mathcal H_1 \mathcal H_1^\dagger \mathcal H_2$ (and its hermitian conjugate) generates the leading contributions to the $Hhh$ and $Hhhh$ couplings in the decoupling limit of the 2HDM. Moreover, the latter coupling governs the resonant prompt tri-Higgs production via $H\to hhh$, which is also directly correlated to $H\to hh$ and $(H\to VV)$, and can yield rates large enough to be measured at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Loop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_\beta \to \ell_\alpha + X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.</description>

      <title>Detector Response Matrices, Effective Areas, and Flash-Effective Areas for Radiation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Detector Response Matrix (DRM) is a discrete representation of an instrument's Detector Response Function (DRF), which quantifies how many discrete energy depositions occur in a detector volume for a given distribution of particles incident on the detector. For simple radiation detectors that can count such energy depositions (such as scintillators, Proportional Counter Tubes (PCTs), etc), we consider the ideal counting DRF, $\mathbf{G}_\varphi (E_\mathrm{in}, E_\mathrm{dep})$, which relates the detector's counting histogram (number of energy depositions within a given channel) to an incident particles characterization, $\varphi$ (e.g. incident flux, fluence, intensity). From the counting DRF we can derive the counting DRM, the effective area, and the flash effective area (which measures the total energy deposited in the detector from a large, instantaneous fluence).</description>

Abstract: We discuss a concept of a lower-energy version of the Large Hadron-electron Collider (LHeC), delivering electron-hadron collisions concurrently to the hadron-hadron collisions at the high-luminosity LHC at CERN. Assuming the use of a 20 GeV electron Energy Recovery Linac (ERL), we report the results on the optimised beam dynamics, accelerator technologies, and detector constraints required for such a "phase-one" LHeC. Finally, we also discuss the ERL configurations and the possibility of delivering electron-hadron collisions during the planned {Run5} of the LHC, which opens excellent research capabilities - the unique scientific potential of the proposed facility is outlined.</description>

      <title>Results from the T2K experiment on neutrino mixing including a new far detector $\mu$-like sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have made improved measurements of three-flavor neutrino mixing with 19.7(16.3)$\times 10^{20}$ protons on target in (anti-)neutrino-enhanced beam modes. A new sample of muon-neutrino events with tagged pions has been added at the far detector, as well as new proton and photon-tagged samples at the near detector. Significant improvements have been made to the flux and neutrino interaction modeling. T2K data continue to prefer the normal mass ordering and upper octant of $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ with a near-maximal value of the charge-parity violating phase with best-fit values in the normal ordering of $\delta_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{CP}}=-2.18\substack{+1.22 \\ -0.47}$, $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.559\substack{+0.018 \\ -0.078}$ and $\Delta{}m^2_{32}=(+2.506\substack{+0.039 \\ -0.052})\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Search for a new scalar resonance decaying to a Higgs boson and another new scalar particle in the final state with two bottom quarks and two photons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

Abstract: A search is presented for a new scalar resonance, X, decaying to a standard model Higgs boson and another new scalar particle, Y, in the final state where the Higgs boson decays to a $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ pair, while the Y particle decays to a pair of photons. The search is performed in the mass range 240$-$1000 GeV for the resonance X, and in the mass range 70$-$800 GeV for the particle Y, using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 132 fb$^{-1}$. In general, the data are found to be compatible with the standard model expectation. Observed (expected) upper limits at 95% confidence level on the product of the production cross section and the relevant branching fraction are extracted for the X $\to$ YH process, and are found to be within the range of 0.05$-$2.69 (0.08$-$1.94) fb, depending on $m_\mathrm{X}$ and $m_\mathrm{Y}$. The most significant deviation from the background-only hypothesis is observed for X and Y masses of 300 and 77 GeV, respectively, with a local (global) significance of 3.33 (0.65) standard deviations.</description>

      <title>General search for supersymmetric particles in scenarios with compressed mass spectra using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general search is presented for supersymmetric particles (sparticles) in scenarios featuring compressed mass spectra using proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. A wide range of potential sparticle signatures are targeted, including pair production of electroweakinos, sleptons, and top squarks. The search focuses on events with a high transverse momentum system from initial-state-radiation jets recoiling against a potential sparticle system with significant missing transverse momentum. Events are categorized based on their lepton multiplicity, jet multiplicity, number of b-tagged jets, and kinematic variables sensitive to the sparticle masses and mass splittings. The sensitivity extends to higher parent sparticle masses than previously probed at the LHC for production of pairs of electroweakinos, sleptons, and top squarks with mass spectra featuring small mass splittings (compressed mass spectra). The observed results demonstrate agreement with the predictions of the background-only model. Lower mass limits are set at 95% confidence level on production of pairs of electroweakinos, sleptons, and top squarks that extend to 325, 275, and 780 GeV, respectively, for the most favorable compressed mass regime cases.</description>

      <title>Constraints on inelastic dark matter from the CDEX-1B experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present limits on spin-independent inelastic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP)-nucleus scattering using the 737.1 kg$\cdot$day dataset from the CDEX-1B experiment. Expected nuclear recoil spectra for various inelastic WIMP masses $m_\chi$ and mass splittings $\delta$ are calculated under the standard halo model. An accurate background model of CDEX-1B is constructed by simulating all major background sources. The model parameters are then determined through maximum likelihood estimation and Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting. The resulting 90\% confidence level upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{\mathrm{n}}$ exclude certain DAMA/LIBRA allowed regions: the $\chi^2 &lt; 4$ regions for $\delta &lt; 30$ keV at $m_\chi = 250$ GeV and the $\chi^2 &lt; 9$ region for $\delta &lt; 50$ keV at $m_\chi = 500$ GeV. The method is applicable to other inelastic dark matter scenarios, and the upcoming CDEX-50 experiment is expected to improve sensitivity by four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing Using Atomic Clocks for Nuclear and Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19424v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Technologies for manipulating single atoms have advanced drastically in the past decades. Due to their excellent controllability of internal states, atoms serve as one of the ideal platforms as quantum systems. One major research direction in atomic systems is the precise determination of physical quantities using atoms, which is included in the field of precision measurements. One of such precisely measured physical quantities is energy differences between two energy levels in atoms, which is symbolized by the remarkable fractional uncertainty of $10^{-18}$ or lower achieved in the state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Two-level systems in atoms are sensitive to various external fields and can, therefore, function as quantum sensors. The effect of these fields manifests as energy shifts in the two-level system. Traditionally, such shifts are induced by electric or magnetic fields, as recognized even before the advent of precision spectroscopy with lasers. With high-precision measurements, tiny energy shifts caused by hypothetical fields weakly coupled to ordinary matter or by small effects mediated by massive particles can be potentially detectable, which are conventionally dealt with in the field of nuclear and particle physics. In most cases, the atomic systems as quantum sensors have not been sensitive enough to detect such effects. Instead, experiments searching for these interactions have placed constraints on coupling constants, except in a few cases where effects are predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Nonetheless, measurements and searches for these effects in atomic systems have led to the emergence of a new field of physics.</description>

      <title>Coherent photoproduction of $\rho^0, \omega$ and excited vector mesons in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The invariant-mass distribution for the coherent photoproduction of dipions in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions is measured using data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $224.6 \pm 9.6 \mu$b$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment in 2018 at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. In the mass range from 400 to 1200 MeV, the results are consistent with previous experiments, with the spectrum dominated by the $\rho^0$ meson, which interferes with a nonresonant component, together with a smaller $\omega$ meson contribution. In an extended mass range up to 2300 MeV, models previously used do not fit the data and a consistent description requires the introduction of two resonances at masses of $1350\pm20$ MeV and $1790\pm20$ MeV with widths of about 300 MeV. The cross-section for each meson is measured differentially in twelve bins of rapidity from 2.05 to 4.90. The $\rho^0$ cross-section increases with rapidity from about 400 to 600 mb and is measured with a typical precision of 8\%, while the cross-section times branching fraction for the $\omega,\rho^\prime$ and $\rho^{\prime\prime}$, with the statistical precision of the data, do not have a pronounced rapidity dependence and are between 0.5 and 1.5 mb, with uncertainties up to 30\%. A large nuclear suppression is observed for the $\rho^0$ meson compared to expectations based on photoproduction on the proton that use the impulse approximation. Significant suppression is also observed compared to that predicted by elastic scattering described in the Glauber approach, or with the addition of inelastic scattering in a Gribov--Glauber model.</description>

      <title>An Online Data Analysis Framework for Small-Scale Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A robust and flexible architecture capable of providing real-time analysis on diagnostic data is of crucial importance to physics experiments. In this paper, we present such an online framework, used in June 2025 as part of the HRMT-68 experiment, performed at the HiRadMat facility at CERN, using the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) beam line. HRMT-68 was a fixed-target laboratory astrophysics experiment aiming to identify plasma instabilities generated by a relativistic electron-positron beam during traversal of an argon plasma. This framework was essential for experimental data acquisition and analysis, and can be adapted for a broad range of experiments with a variety of experimental diagnostics. The framework's modular and customizable design enabled us to rapidly observe and extract emergent features from a diverse range of diagnostic data. Simultaneously, it allowed for both the introduction of new diagnostic devices and the modification of our analysis as features of interest were identified. As a result, we were able to effectively diagnose equipment malfunction, and infer the beam's response to varying bunch duration, beam intensity, and the plasma state without resorting to offline analysis, at which time adjustment or improvement would have been impossible. We present the features of this agile framework, whose codebase we have made publicly available, which can be adapted for future experiments with minimal modification.</description>

      <title>Setting limits on blazar-boosted dark matter with xenon-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time-projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity to dark matter in the mass range from about 10 to 1000~GeV/$c^{2}$. However, sub-GeV dark-matter particles do not produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter provides a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear-recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark-matter search that incorporates full detector-response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS 0506+056. We model dark matter-proton scattering in the jet environment, tracing the full process from acceleration in the jet to the detector response on Earth, and we investigate the impact of the host-galaxy dark-matter density profile on the predicted signals. We set model-dependent exclusion regions on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section for dark matter with mass $m_\chi \simeq 1~\mathrm{MeV}$. Using XENON1T data, the excluded cross-section range spans approximately $5.8\times10^{-31}$ to $6.3\times10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, while LZ effective-field-theory searches exclude cross sections between $9.9\times10^{-32}$ and $2.5\times10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties -- particularly those associated with the dark-matter distribution near the supermassive black hole -- are the dominant limitation of this search, rather than detector-related effects. The resulting limits are therefore model-dependent and should be regarded as exploratory, highlighting both the potential and the present theoretical uncertainties of blazar-boosted dark matter as a probe of light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Meson properties and symmetry emergence based on the deep neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a key property of hadrons, the total width is quite difficult to obtain in theory due to the extreme complexity of the strong and electroweak interactions. In this work, a deep neural network model with the Transformer architecture is built to precisely predict meson widths in the range of $10^{-14} \sim 625$ MeV based on meson quantum numbers and masses. The relative errors of the predictions are $0.12\%, 2.0\%,$ and $0.54\%$ in the training set, the test set, and all the data, respectively. We present the predicted meson width spectra for the currently discovered states and some theoretically predicted ones. The model is also used as a probe to study the quantum numbers and inner structures for some undetermined states including the exotic states. Notably, this data-driven model is investigated to spontaneously exhibit good charge conjugation symmetry and approximate isospin symmetry consistent with physical principles. The results indicate that the deep neural network can serve as an independent complementary research paradigm to describe and explore the hadron structures and the complicated interactions in particle physics alongside the traditional experimental measurements, theoretical calculations, and lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional imaging of hadrons with hard exclusive reactions: advances in experiment, theory, phenomenology, and lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) have emerged as a powerful framework for exploring the internal structure of hadrons in terms of their partonic constituents. Over the past three decades, the field has witnessed significant theoretical and experimental advancements. The interpretation of GPDs in impact parameter space offers a vivid three-dimensional visualization of hadron structure, correlating longitudinal momentum and transverse spatial distributions, thereby enabling tomographic imaging of hadrons. Furthermore, the link between GPDs and the matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor provides access to fundamental properties of hadrons, including spin decomposition and internal pressure distributions. Notably, recent analyses of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) data have enabled the empirical extraction of the quark pressure profile inside the proton. This white paper presents an overview of recent developments in GPD theory and phenomenology, as well as progress in lattice QCD studies. It outlines the prospects for advancing our understanding of hadron structure through the next generation of dedicated experiments, including the extension of the Jefferson Lab 12~GeV program (and its potential 22~GeV upgrade), J-PARC, COMPASS/AMBER, LHC ultra-peripheral collisions, and the future electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC.</description>

      <title>Optimal operating parameters for next-generation xenon gas time projection chambers</title>

Abstract: The next-generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) searches are targeting half-life sensitivities towards 10$^{27}$--10$^{28}$ years. Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.</description>
