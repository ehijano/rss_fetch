      <title>Removing GPT4's Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GPT4 was initially trained on large amounts of data, and then fine-tuned using Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which is when volunteers give feedback in order to teach GPT4 not to create inappropriate content. In this paper, we present a method to manipulate the fine-tuned version into reverting to pre-RLHF behavior, effectively removing all safety mechanisms that the model learned during RLHF. In particular, when GPT4 acts without RLHF, it loses all inhibition, and can complete very inappropriate content given only the first few words.</description>

      <title>Towards Trust and Reputation as a Service in a Blockchain-based Decentralized Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenges inherent in implementing trusted services in the Society 5.0 initiative, we propose a novel trust and reputation service for a decentralized marketplace. We assume that a Smart Contract is associated with each transaction and that the Smart Contract is responsible for providing automatic feedback, replacing notoriously unreliable buyer feedback by a more objective assessment of how well the parties have fulfilled their obligations. Our trust and reputation service was inspired by Laplace Law of Succession, where trust in a seller is defined as the probability that she will fulfill her obligations on the next transaction. We offer three applications. First, we discuss an application to a multi-segment marketplace, where a malicious seller may establish a stellar reputation by selling cheap items, only to use their excellent reputation to defraud buyers in a different market segment. Next, we demonstrate how our trust and reputation service works in the context of sellers with time-varying performance by providing two discounting schemes wherein older reputation scores are given less weight than more recent ones. Finally, we show how to predict trust and reputation far in the future, based on incomplete information. Extensive simulations have confirmed our analytical results.</description>

      <title>Selective Encryption using Segmentation Mask with Chaotic Henon Map for Multidimensional Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A user-centric design and resource optimization should be at the center of any technology or innovation. The user-centric perspective gives the developer the opportunity to develop with task-based optimization. The user in the medical image field is a medical professional who analyzes the medical images and gives their diagnosis results to the patient. This scheme, having the medical professional user's perspective, innovates in the area of Medical Image storage and security. The architecture is designed with three main segments, namely: Segmentation, Storage, and Retrieval. This architecture was designed owing to the fact that the number of retrieval operations done by medical professionals was toweringly higher when compared to the storage operations done for some handful number of times for a particular medical image. This gives room for our innovation to segment out the medically indispensable part of the medical image, encrypt it, and store it. By encrypting the vital parts of the image using a strong encryption algorithm like the chaotic Henon map, we are able to keep the security intact. Now retrieving the medical image demands only the computationally less stressing decryption of the segmented region of interest. The decryption of the segmented region of interest results in the full recovery of the medical image which can be viewed on demand by the medical professionals for various diagnosis purposes. In this scheme, we were able to achieve a retrieval speed improvement of around 47% when compared to a full image encryption of brain medical CT images.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Federated Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as the training and tuning protocol for applications utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research highlights the need for significant modifications to FL to accommodate the large-scale of LLMs. While substantial adjustments to the protocol have been introduced as a response, comprehensive privacy analysis for the adapted FL protocol is currently lacking.
  To address this gap, our work delves into an extensive examination of the privacy analysis of FL when used for training LLMs, both from theoretical and practical perspectives. In particular, we design two active membership inference attacks with guaranteed theoretical success rates to assess the privacy leakages of various adapted FL configurations. Our theoretical findings are translated into practical attacks, revealing substantial privacy vulnerabilities in popular LLMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and OpenAI's GPTs, across multiple real-world language datasets. Additionally, we conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the privacy leakage of these models when data is protected by state-of-the-art differential privacy (DP) mechanisms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering transformative capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, with their rising prominence, the security and vulnerability aspects of these models have garnered significant attention. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the various forms of attacks targeting LLMs, discussing the nature and mechanisms of these attacks, their potential impacts, and current defense strategies. We delve into topics such as adversarial attacks that aim to manipulate model outputs, data poisoning that affects model training, and privacy concerns related to training data exploitation. The paper also explores the effectiveness of different attack methodologies, the resilience of LLMs against these attacks, and the implications for model integrity and user trust. By examining the latest research, we provide insights into the current landscape of LLM vulnerabilities and defense mechanisms. Our objective is to offer a nuanced understanding of LLM attacks, foster awareness within the AI community, and inspire robust solutions to mitigate these risks in future developments.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enhanced UAV Networks for Post-Disaster Communication: A Decentralized Flocking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have significant potential for agile communication and relief coordination in post-disaster scenarios, particularly when ground infrastructure is compromised. However, efficiently coordinating and securing flocks of heterogeneous UAVs from different service providers poses significant challenges related to privacy, scalability, lightweight consensus protocols, and comprehensive cybersecurity mechanisms. This study introduces a robust blockchain-enabled framework designed to tackle these technical challenges through a combination of consensus protocols, smart contracts, and cryptographic techniques. First, we propose a consortium blockchain architecture that ensures secure and private multi-agency coordination by controlling access and safeguarding the privacy of sensitive data. Second, we develop an optimized hybrid consensus protocol that merges Delegated Proof of Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPOS-PBFT), aiming to achieve an effective balance between efficiency, security, and resilience against node failures. Finally, we introduce decentralized flocking algorithms that facilitate adaptable and autonomous operations among specialized UAV clusters, ensuring critical disaster relief functions under conditions of uncertain connectivity. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate the system achieved linear scaling of throughput up to 500 UAV nodes, with only a 50ms increase in latency from 10 to 500 nodes. The framework maintained high throughput and low latency despite spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), and tampering attacks, showing strong cyber resilience. Communication latencies were kept under 10ms for diverse UAV operations through self-optimizing network intelligence, with median values around 2-3ms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Security in Federated Learning through Adaptive Consensus-Based Model Update Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an advanced approach for fortifying Federated Learning (FL) systems against label-flipping attacks. We propose a simplified consensus-based verification process integrated with an adaptive thresholding mechanism. This dynamic thresholding is designed to adjust based on the evolving landscape of model updates, offering a refined layer of anomaly detection that aligns with the real-time needs of distributed learning environments. Our method necessitates a majority consensus among participating clients to validate updates, ensuring that only vetted and consensual modifications are applied to the global model. The efficacy of our approach is validated through experiments on two benchmark datasets in deep learning, CIFAR-10 and MNIST. Our results indicate a significant mitigation of label-flipping attacks, bolstering the FL system's resilience. This method transcends conventional techniques that depend on anomaly detection or statistical validation by incorporating a verification layer reminiscent of blockchain's participatory validation without the associated cryptographic overhead. The innovation of our approach rests in striking an optimal balance between heightened security measures and the inherent limitations of FL systems, such as computational efficiency and data privacy. Implementing a consensus mechanism specifically tailored for FL environments paves the way for more secure, robust, and trustworthy distributed machine learning applications, where safeguarding data integrity and model robustness is critical.</description>

      <title>WaterMax: breaking the LLM watermark detectability-robustness-quality trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking is a technical means to dissuade malfeasant usage of Large Language Models. This paper proposes a novel watermarking scheme, so-called WaterMax, that enjoys high detectability while sustaining the quality of the generated text of the original LLM. Its new design leaves the LLM untouched (no modification of the weights, logits, temperature, or sampling technique). WaterMax balances robustness and complexity contrary to the watermarking techniques of the literature inherently provoking a trade-off between quality and robustness. Its performance is both theoretically proven and experimentally validated. It outperforms all the SotA techniques under the most complete benchmark suite.</description>

      <title>Group Privacy Amplification and Unified Amplification by Subsampling for R\'enyi Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) has various desirable properties, such as robustness to post-processing, group privacy, and amplification by subsampling, which can be derived independently of each other. Our goal is to determine whether stronger privacy guarantees can be obtained by considering multiple of these properties jointly. To this end, we focus on the combination of group privacy and amplification by subsampling. To provide guarantees that are amenable to machine learning algorithms, we conduct our analysis in the framework of R\'enyi-DP, which has more favorable composition properties than $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. As part of this analysis, we develop a unified framework for deriving amplification by subsampling guarantees for R\'enyi-DP, which represents the first such framework for a privacy accounting method and is of independent interest. We find that it not only lets us improve upon and generalize existing amplification results for R\'enyi-DP, but also derive provably tight group privacy amplification guarantees stronger than existing principles. These results establish the joint study of different DP properties as a promising research direction.</description>

      <title>Secure Information Embedding and Extraction in Forensic 3D Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence of 3D printing poses a significant risk to public safety, as any individual with internet access and a commodity printer is able to produce untraceable firearms, keys, counterfeit products, etc. To aid government authorities in combating these new security threats, several approaches have been taken to tag 3D-prints with identifying information. Known as fingerprints, this information is written into the object using various bit embedding techniques; examples include varying the height of the molten thermoplastic layers, and depositing metallic powder with different magnetic properties. Yet, the practicality of theses techniques in real-world forensic settings is hindered by the adversarial nature of this problem. That is, the 3D-printing process is out of reach of any law enforcement agencies; it is the adversary who controls all aspects of printing and possesses the printed object. To combat these threats, law enforcement agencies can regulate the manufacturing of 3D printers, on which they may enforce a fingerprinting scheme, and collect adversarially tampered remains (e.g., fragments of a broken 3D-printed firearm) during forensic investigation. Therefore, it is important to devise fingerprinting techniques so that the fingerprint could be extracted even if printing is carried out by the adversary. To this end, we present SIDE (Secure Information Embedding and Extraction), a fingerprinting framework that tackles the adversarial nature of forensic fingerprinting in 3D prints by offering both secure information embedding and secure information extraction.</description>

      <title>SecGPT: An Execution Isolation Architecture for LLM-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) extended as systems, such as ChatGPT, have begun supporting third-party applications. These LLM apps leverage the de facto natural language-based automated execution paradigm of LLMs: that is, apps and their interactions are defined in natural language, provided access to user data, and allowed to freely interact with each other and the system. These LLM app ecosystems resemble the settings of earlier computing platforms, where there was insufficient isolation between apps and the system. Because third-party apps may not be trustworthy, and exacerbated by the imprecision of the natural language interfaces, the current designs pose security and privacy risks for users. In this paper, we propose SecGPT, an architecture for LLM-based systems that aims to mitigate the security and privacy issues that arise with the execution of third-party apps. SecGPT's key idea is to isolate the execution of apps and more precisely mediate their interactions outside of their isolated environments. We evaluate SecGPT against a number of case study attacks and demonstrate that it protects against many security, privacy, and safety issues that exist in non-isolated LLM-based systems. The performance overhead incurred by SecGPT to improve security is under 0.3x for three-quarters of the tested queries. To foster follow-up research, we release SecGPT's source code at https://github.com/llm-platform-security/SecGPT.</description>

      <title>DT-SIM: Property-Based Testing for MPC Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal methods for guaranteeing that a protocol satisfies a cryptographic security definition have advanced substantially, but such methods are still labor intensive and the need remains for an automated tool that can positively identify an insecure protocol. In this work, we demonstrate that property-based testing, "run it a bunch of times and see if it breaks", is effective for detecting security bugs in secure protocols. We specifically target Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), because formal methods targeting this security definition for bit-model implementations are particularly difficult. Using results from the literature for Probabilistic Programming Languages and statistical inference, we devise a test that can detect various flaws in a bit-level implementation of an MPC protocol. The test is grey-box; it requires only transcripts of randomness consumed by the protocol and of the inputs, outputs, and messages. It successfully detects several different mistakes and biases introduced into two different implementations of the classic GMW protocol. Applied to hundreds of randomly generated protocols, it identifies nearly all of them as insecure. We also include an analysis of the parameters of the test, and discussion of what makes detection of MPC (in)security difficult.</description>

      <title>Defending Against Unforeseen Failure Modes with Latent Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors post-deployment. This is often despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers. Minimizing risks from models is challenging because the attack surface is so large. It is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may cause a model to fail. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to make AI systems more robust. However, they have not been sufficient to avoid many real-world failure modes that differ from the ones adversarially trained on. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without generating inputs that elicit them. LAT leverages the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. We use LAT to remove trojans and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.</description>

      <title>Private Count Release: A Simple and Scalable Approach for Private Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data analytics system that ensures accurate counts can be released with differential privacy and minimal onboarding effort while showing instances that outperform other approaches that require more onboarding effort. The primary difference between our proposal and existing approaches is that it does not rely on user contribution bounds over distinct elements, i.e. $\ell_0$-sensitivity bounds, which can significantly bias counts. Contribution bounds for $\ell_0$-sensitivity have been considered as necessary to ensure differential privacy, but we show that this is actually not necessary and can lead to releasing more results that are more accurate. We require minimal hyperparameter tuning and demonstrate results on several publicly available dataset. We hope that this approach will help differential privacy scale to many different data analytics applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Adversarial Frontier: Quantifying Robustness via Adversarial Hypervolume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating threat of adversarial attacks on deep learning models, particularly in security-critical fields, has underscored the need for robust deep learning systems. Conventional robustness evaluations have relied on adversarial accuracy, which measures a model's performance under a specific perturbation intensity. However, this singular metric does not fully encapsulate the overall resilience of a model against varying degrees of perturbation. To address this gap, we propose a new metric termed adversarial hypervolume, assessing the robustness of deep learning models comprehensively over a range of perturbation intensities from a multi-objective optimization standpoint. This metric allows for an in-depth comparison of defense mechanisms and recognizes the trivial improvements in robustness afforded by less potent defensive strategies. Additionally, we adopt a novel training algorithm that enhances adversarial robustness uniformly across various perturbation intensities, in contrast to methods narrowly focused on optimizing adversarial accuracy. Our extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the adversarial hypervolume metric, demonstrating its ability to reveal subtle differences in robustness that adversarial accuracy overlooks. This research contributes a new measure of robustness and establishes a standard for assessing and benchmarking the resilience of current and future defensive models against adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>On Protecting the Data Privacy of Large Language Models (LLMs): A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are complex artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding, generating and translating human language. They learn language patterns by analyzing large amounts of text data, allowing them to perform writing, conversation, summarizing and other language tasks. When LLMs process and generate large amounts of data, there is a risk of leaking sensitive information, which may threaten data privacy. This paper concentrates on elucidating the data privacy concerns associated with LLMs to foster a comprehensive understanding. Specifically, a thorough investigation is undertaken to delineate the spectrum of data privacy threats, encompassing both passive privacy leakage and active privacy attacks within LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct an assessment of the privacy protection mechanisms employed by LLMs at various stages, followed by a detailed examination of their efficacy and constraints. Finally, the discourse extends to delineate the challenges encountered and outline prospective directions for advancement in the realm of LLM privacy protection.</description>

      <title>TIPS: Threat Sharing Information Platform for Enhanced Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing need to share threat information for the prevention of widespread cyber-attacks. While threat-related information sharing can be conducted through traditional information exchange methods, such as email communications etc., these methods are often weak in terms of their trustworthiness and privacy. Additionally, the absence of a trust infrastructure between different information-sharing domains also poses significant challenges. These challenges include redactment of information, the Right-to-be-forgotten, and access control to the information-sharing elements. These access issues could be related to time bounds, the trusted deletion of data, and the location of accesses. This paper presents an abstraction of a trusted information-sharing process which integrates Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) integrated into a permissioned ledger, specifically Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). It then provides a protocol exchange between two threat-sharing agents that share encrypted messages through a trusted channel. This trusted channel can only be accessed by those trusted in the sharing and could be enabled for each data-sharing element or set up for long-term sharing.</description>

      <title>Elections in the Post-Quantum Era: Is the Complexity Shield Strong Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The election, a cornerstone of democracy, is one of the best-recognizable symbols of democratic governance. Voters' confidence in elections is essential, and these days, we can watch practically in live broadcast what consequences distrust in the fairness of elections may have. From the times of the celebrated Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, it is well-known in the social-choice community that most voting systems are vulnerable to the efforts of various players to influence elections. Luckily for us, computing such influence to affect election outcomes is a hard problem from the computational complexity perspective. This intractability is regarded as a ``complexity shield'' that secures voting rules against this malicious behavior.
  In this work, we consider quantum computers to be a new threat to the complexity shield described above, as they break out of standard computing paradigms and unlock additional computational resources. To this end, we provide an overview of possible attacks on election, discuss the abilities of quantum computing, and chart possible directions for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>vSPACE: Voting in a Scalable, Privacy-Aware and Confidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vSPACE experimental proof-of-concept (PoC) on the TrueElect[Anon][Creds] protocol presents a novel approach to secure, private, and scalable elections, extending the TrueElect and ElectAnon protocols with the integration of AnonCreds SSI (Self-Sovereign Identity). Such a protocol PoC is situated within a Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) and leverages confidential computing, continuous authentication, multi-party computation (MPC), and well-architected framework (WAF) principles to address the challenges of cybersecurity, privacy, and trust over IP (ToIP) protection. Employing a Kubernetes confidential cluster within an Enterprise-Scale Landing Zone (ESLZ), vSPACE integrates Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for immutable and certifiable audit trails. The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model ensures rapid deployment, consistent management, and adherence to security standards, making vSPACE a future-proof solution for digital voting systems.</description>

      <title>On Practicality of Using ARM TrustZone Trusted Execution Environment for Securing Programmable Logic Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are crucial devices for implementing automated control in various industrial control systems (ICS), such as smart power grids, water treatment systems, manufacturing, and transportation systems. Owing to their importance, PLCs are often the target of cyber attackers that are aiming at disrupting the operation of ICS, including the nation's critical infrastructure, by compromising the integrity of control logic execution. While a wide range of cybersecurity solutions for ICS have been proposed, they cannot counter strong adversaries with a foothold on the PLC devices, which could manipulate memory, I/O interface, or PLC logic itself. These days, many ICS devices in the market, including PLCs, run on ARM-based processors, and there is a promising security technology called ARM TrustZone, to offer a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on embedded devices. Envisioning that such a hardware-assisted security feature becomes available for ICS devices in the near future, this paper investigates the application of the ARM TrustZone TEE technology for enhancing the security of PLC. Our aim is to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the TEE-based PLCs through the proof-of-concept design and implementation using open-source software such as OP-TEE and OpenPLC. Our evaluation assesses the performance and resource consumption in real-world ICS configurations, and based on the results, we discuss bottlenecks in the OP-TEE secure OS towards a large-scale ICS and desired changes for its application on ICS devices. Our implementation is made available to public for further study and research.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Difference-of-Convex Solver for Privacy Funnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient solver for the privacy funnel (PF) method, leveraging its difference-of-convex (DC) structure. The proposed DC separation results in a closed-form update equation, which allows straightforward application to both known and unknown distribution settings. For known distribution case, we prove the convergence (local stationary points) of the proposed non-greedy solver, and empirically show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off. The insights of our DC approach apply to unknown distribution settings where labeled empirical samples are available instead. Leveraging the insights, our alternating minimization solver satisfies the fundamental Markov relation of PF in contrast to previous variational inference-based solvers. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed solver with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results show that under a comparable reconstruction quality, an adversary suffers from higher prediction error from clustering our compressed codes than that with the compared methods. Most importantly, our solver is independent to private information in inference phase contrary to the baselines.</description>

      <title>AutoDefense: Multi-Agent LLM Defense against Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive pre-training and fine-tuning in moral alignment to prevent generating harmful information at user request, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose AutoDefense, a response-filtering based multi-agent defense framework that filters harmful responses from LLMs. This framework assigns different roles to LLM agents and employs them to complete the defense task collaboratively. The division in tasks enhances the overall instruction-following of LLMs and enables the integration of other defense components as tools. AutoDefense can adapt to various sizes and kinds of open-source LLMs that serve as agents. Through conducting extensive experiments on a large scale of harmful and safe prompts, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed AutoDefense in improving the robustness against jailbreak attacks, while maintaining the performance at normal user request. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/XHMY/AutoDefense.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bound for Differentially Private Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the differentially private (DP) facility location problem in the so called super-set output setting proposed by Gupta et al. [SODA 2010]. The current best known expected approximation ratio for an $\epsilon$-DP algorithm is $O\left(\frac{\log n}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\right)$ due to Cohen-Addad et al. [AISTATS 2022] where $n$ denote the size of the metric space, meanwhile the best known lower bound is $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ [NeurIPS 2019].
  In this short note, we give a lower bound of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\min\left\{\log n, \sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\epsilon}}\right\}\right)$ on the expected approximation ratio of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm, which is the first evidence that the approximation ratio has to grow with the size of the metric space.</description>

      <title>Profile of Vulnerability Remediations in Dependencies Using Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces graph analysis methods and a modified Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Network (GAT) to the critical challenge of open source package vulnerability remediation by analyzing control flow graphs to profile breaking changes in applications occurring from dependency upgrades intended to remediate vulnerabilities. Our approach uniquely applies node centrality metrics -- degree, norm, and closeness centrality -- to the GAT model, enabling a detailed examination of package code interactions with a focus on identifying and understanding vulnerable nodes, and when dependency package upgrades will interfere with application workflow. The study's application on a varied dataset reveals an unexpected limited inter-connectivity of vulnerabilities in core code, thus challenging established notions in software security. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhanced GAT model in offering nuanced insights into the relational dynamics of code vulnerabilities, proving its potential in advancing cybersecurity measures. This approach not only aids in the strategic mitigation of vulnerabilities but also lays the groundwork for the development of sophisticated, sustainable monitoring systems for the evaluation of work effort for vulnerability remediation resulting from open source software. The insights gained from this study mark a significant advancement in the field of package vulnerability analysis and cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Sparse Teacher: Defense Against Distillation-Based Model Stealing Attacks Using Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) facilitates the transfer of discriminative capabilities from an advanced teacher model to a simpler student model, ensuring performance enhancement without compromising accuracy. It is also exploited for model stealing attacks, where adversaries use KD to mimic the functionality of a teacher model. Recent developments in this domain have been influenced by the Stingy Teacher model, which provided empirical analysis showing that sparse outputs can significantly degrade the performance of student models. Addressing the risk of intellectual property leakage, our work introduces an approach to train a teacher model that inherently protects its logits, influenced by the Nasty Teacher concept. Differing from existing methods, we incorporate sparse outputs of adversarial examples with standard training data to strengthen the teacher's defense against student distillation. Our approach carefully reduces the relative entropy between the original and adversarially perturbed outputs, allowing the model to produce adversarial logits with minimal impact on overall performance. The source codes will be made publicly available soon.</description>

Abstract: The recent success of machine learning (ML) has been fueled by the increasing availability of computing power and large amounts of data in many different applications. However, the trustworthiness of the resulting models can be compromised when such data is maliciously manipulated to mislead the learning process. In this article, we first review poisoning attacks that compromise the training data used to learn ML models, including attacks that aim to reduce the overall performance, manipulate the predictions on specific test samples, and even implant backdoors in the model. We then discuss how to mitigate these attacks using basic security principles, or by deploying ML-oriented defensive mechanisms. We conclude our article by formulating some relevant open challenges which are hindering the development of testing methods and benchmarks suitable for assessing and improving the trustworthiness of ML models against data poisoning attacks</description>

      <title>New intelligent defense systems to reduce the risks of Selfish Mining and Double-Spending attacks using Learning Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the critical challenges of double-spending and selfish mining attacks in blockchain-based digital currencies. Double-spending is a problem where the same tender is spent multiple times during a digital currency transaction, while selfish mining is an intentional alteration of a blockchain to increase rewards to one miner or a group of miners. We introduce a new attack that combines both these attacks and propose a machine learning-based solution to mitigate the risks associated with them. Specifically, we use the learning automaton, a powerful online learning method, to develop two models, namely the SDTLA and WVBM, which can effectively defend against selfish mining attacks. Our experimental results show that the SDTLA method increases the profitability threshold of selfish mining up to 47$\%$, while the WVBM method performs even better and is very close to the ideal situation where each miner's revenue is proportional to their shared hash processing power. Additionally, we demonstrate that both methods can effectively reduce the risks of double-spending by tuning the $Z$ Parameter. Our findings highlight the potential of SDTLA and WVBM as promising solutions for enhancing the security and efficiency of blockchain networks.</description>

Abstract: Innovative solution for addressing the challenges in the legal records management system through a blockchain-based eVault platform. Our objective is to create a secure, transparent, and accessible ecosystem that caters to the needs of all stakeholders, including lawyers, judges, clients, and registrars. First and foremost, our solution is built on a robust blockchain platform like Ethereum harnessing the power of smart contracts to manage access, permissions, and transactions effectively. This ensures the utmost security and transparency in every interaction within the system. To make our eVault system user-friendly, we've developed intuitive interfaces for all stakeholders. Lawyers, judges, clients, and even registrars can effortlessly upload and retrieve legal documents, track changes, and share information within the platform. But that's not all; we've gone a step further by incorporating a document creation and saving feature within our app and website. This feature allows users to generate and securely store legal documents, streamlining the entire documentation process.</description>

Abstract: We give a construction of public key quantum money, and even a strengthened version called quantum lightning, from abelian group actions, which can in turn be constructed from suitable isogenies over elliptic curves. We prove security in the generic group model for group actions under a plausible computational assumption, and develop a general toolkit for proving quantum security in this model. Along the way, we explore knowledge assumptions and algebraic group actions in the quantum setting, finding significant limitations of these assumptions/models compared to generic group actions.</description>

      <title>Be Careful What You Smooth For: Label Smoothing Can Be a Privacy Shield but Also a Catalyst for Model Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06549v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Label smoothing -- using softened labels instead of hard ones -- is a widely adopted regularization method for deep learning, showing diverse benefits such as enhanced generalization and calibration. Its implications for preserving model privacy, however, have remained unexplored. To fill this gap, we investigate the impact of label smoothing on model inversion attacks (MIAs), which aim to generate class-representative samples by exploiting the knowledge encoded in a classifier, thereby inferring sensitive information about its training data. Through extensive analyses, we uncover that traditional label smoothing fosters MIAs, thereby increasing a model's privacy leakage. Even more, we reveal that smoothing with negative factors counters this trend, impeding the extraction of class-related information and leading to privacy preservation, beating state-of-the-art defenses. This establishes a practical and powerful novel way for enhancing model resilience against MIAs.</description>
