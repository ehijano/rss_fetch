      <title>Deep Brain Ultrasound Ablation Thermal Dose Modeling with in Vivo Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracorporeal needle-based therapeutic ultrasound (NBTU) is a minimally invasive option for intervening in malignant brain tumors, commonly used in thermal ablation procedures. This technique is suitable for both primary and metastatic cancers, utilizing a high-frequency alternating electric field (up to 10 MHz) to excite a piezoelectric transducer. The resulting rapid deformation of the transducer produces an acoustic wave that propagates through tissue, leading to localized high-temperature heating at the target tumor site and inducing rapid cell death. To optimize the design of NBTU transducers for thermal dose delivery during treatment, numerical modeling of the acoustic pressure field generated by the deforming piezoelectric transducer is frequently employed. The bioheat transfer process generated by the input pressure field is used to track the thermal propagation of the applicator over time. Magnetic resonance thermal imaging (MRTI) can be used to experimentally validate these models. Validation results using MRTI demonstrated the feasibility of this model, showing a consistent thermal propagation pattern. However, a thermal damage isodose map is more advantageous for evaluating therapeutic efficacy. To achieve a more accurate simulation based on the actual brain tissue environment, a new finite element method (FEM) simulation with enhanced damage evaluation capabilities was conducted. The results showed that the highest temperature and ablated volume differed between experimental and simulation results by 2.1884{\deg}C (3.71%) and 0.0631 cm$^3$ (5.74%), respectively. The lowest Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for peak temperature was 0.7117, and the lowest Dice coefficient for the ablated area was 0.7021, indicating a good agreement in accuracy between simulation and experiment.</description>

      <title>Personalized and uncertainty-aware coronary hemodynamics simulations: From Bayesian estimation to improved multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of coronary hemodynamics have improved non-invasive clinical risk stratification and treatment outcomes for coronary artery disease, compared to relying on anatomical imaging alone. However, simulations typically use empirical approaches to distribute total coronary flow amongst the arteries in the coronary tree. This ignores patient variability, the presence of disease, and other clinical factors. Further, uncertainty in the clinical data often remains unaccounted for in the modeling pipeline. We present an end-to-end uncertainty-aware pipeline to (1) personalize coronary flow simulations by incorporating branch-specific coronary flows as well as cardiac function; and (2) predict clinical and biomechanical quantities of interest with improved precision, while accounting for uncertainty in the clinical data. We assimilate patient-specific measurements of myocardial blood flow from CT myocardial perfusion imaging to estimate branch-specific coronary flows. We use adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the joint posterior distributions of model parameters with simulated noise in the clinical data. Additionally, we determine the posterior predictive distribution for relevant quantities of interest using a new approach combining multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimation with non-linear, data-driven dimensionality reduction. Our framework recapitulates clinically measured cardiac function as well as branch-specific coronary flows under measurement uncertainty. We substantially shrink the confidence intervals for estimated quantities of interest compared to single-fidelity and state-of-the-art multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods. This is especially true for quantities that showed limited correlation between the low- and high-fidelity model predictions. Moreover, the proposed estimators are significantly cheaper to compute for a specified confidence level or variance.</description>

      <title>A feasible dose-volume estimation of radiotherapy treatment with optimal transport using a concept for transportation of Ricci-flat time-varying dose-volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In radiotherapy, the dose-volume histogram (DVH) curve is an important means of evaluating the clinical feasibility of tumor control and side effects in normal organs against actual treatment. Fractionation, distributing the amounts of irradiation, is used to enhance the treatment effectiveness of tumor control and mitigation of normal tissue damage. Therefore, dose and volume receive time-varying effects per fractional treatment event. However, the difficulty of DVH superimposition of different situations prevents evaluation of the total DVH despite different shapes and receiving dose distributions of organs in each fraction. However, an actual evaluation is determined traditionally by the initial treatment plan because of summation difficulty. Mathematically, this difficulty can be regarded as a kind of optimal transport of DVH. For this study, we introduced DVH transportation on the curvilinear orthogonal space with respect to arbitrary time ($T$), time-varying dose ($D$), and time-varying volume ($V$), which was designated as the TDV space embedded in the Riemannian manifold.Transportation in the TDV space should satisfy the following: (a) the metrics between dose and volume must be equivalent for any fractions and (b) the cumulative characteristic of DVH must hold irrespective of the lapse of time. With consideration of the Ricci-flat condition for the $D$-direction and $V$-direction, we obtained the probability density distribution, which is described by Poisson's equation with radial diffusion process toward $T$. This geometrical requirement and transportation equation rigorously provided the feasible total DVH.</description>

      <title>$\mu$GUIDE: a framework for quantitative imaging via generalized uncertainty-driven inference using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17293v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes $\mu$GUIDE: a general Bayesian framework to estimate posterior distributions of tissue microstructure parameters from any given biophysical model or MRI signal representation, with exemplar demonstration in diffusion-weighted MRI. Harnessing a new deep learning architecture for automatic signal feature selection combined with simulation-based inference and efficient sampling of the posterior distributions, $\mu$GUIDE bypasses the high computational and time cost of conventional Bayesian approaches and does not rely on acquisition constraints to define model-specific summary statistics. The obtained posterior distributions allow to highlight degeneracies present in the model definition and quantify the uncertainty and ambiguity of the estimated parameters.</description>
