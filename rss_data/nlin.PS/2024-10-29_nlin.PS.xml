      <title>The impact of a wind switch on the stability of traveling fronts in a reaction-diffusion model of fire propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For certain values of the wave speed parameter, evolution equations for the temperature of a region of fuel admit traveling wave solutions describing fire fronts. We consider such a system in the form of a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation with a first-order forcing term capturing the combined effects of ambient and fire-induced wind. The fire-induced wind is introduced by way of a piecewise continuous function that ``switches'' in space. We demonstrate that, in the case of a spatially dependent wind, traveling wave solutions corresponding to fire fronts exist for a continuum of wave speeds rather than for a single unique speed. Using geometric methods, we determine the range of allowable speeds, refine this range to only those fronts which will persist in nature, and develop a selection mechanism to identify the specific wind configuration corresponding to the most stable solution. For this spectrally preferred front, we find that the wind switch occurs ahead of the fireline in a manner consistent with the physics of air entrainment. Even when the wind is not coupled to the temperature and is instead imposed as an external forcing, the conditions on the existence and stability of front solutions force the wind term in to a configuration reflective of physical reality.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystals in pattern formation, Part I: Local existence and basic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general mechanism for the existence of quasicrystals in spatially extended systems (partial differential equations with Euclidean symmetry). We argue that the existence of quasicrystals with higher order rotational symmetry, icosahedral symmetry, etc, is a natural and universal consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, bypassing technical issues such as Diophantine properties and hard implicit function theorems. The diffraction diagrams associated with these quasicrystal solutions are not Delone sets, so strictly speaking they do not conform to the definition of a ``mathematical quasicrystal''. But they do appear to capture very well the features of the diffraction diagrams of quasicrystals observed in nature. For the Swift-Hohenberg equation, we obtain more detailed information, including that the $\ell^2$ norm of the diffraction diagram grows like the square root of the bifurcation parameter.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by nonlinear interaction in a coupler supported by fractional diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a one-dimensional model of coupled fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a double-well potential applied to one component. This study examines ground state (GS) solitons, observing spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both the actuated field and the partner component due to linear coupling. Numerical simulations reveal symmetric and asymmetric profiles arising from a slightly asymmetric initial condition. Asymmetry is influenced by nonlinearities, potential depth, and coupling strength, with self-focusing systems favoring greater asymmetry. Fractional diffraction affects the amplitude and localization of symmetric profiles and the stability of asymmetric ones. We identify critical L\'evy index values for generating coupled GS solitons. Stability analysis of unstable, centrally asymmetric GS solitons demonstrates oscillatory dynamics, providing new insights into SSB in fractional systems and half-trapped solitons.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Peaked Stokes waves as solutions of Babenko's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Babenko's equation describes traveling water waves in holomorphic coordinates. It has been used in the past to obtain properties of Stokes waves with smooth profiles analytically and numerically. We show in the deep-water limit that properties of Stokes waves with peaked profiles can also be recovered from the same Babenko's equation. In order to develop the local analysis of singularities, we rewrite Babenko's equation as a fixed-point problem near the maximal elevation level. As a by-product, our results rule out a corner point singularity in the holomorphic coordinates, which has been obtained in a local version of Babenko's equation.</description>

      <title>A steady-state frictional crack in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analogy between frictional cracks, propagating along interfaces in frictional contact, and ordinary cracks in bulk materials is important in various fields. We consider a stress-controlled frictional crack propagating at a velocity $c_{\rm r}$ along an interface separating two strips, each of height $H$, the frictional counterpart of the classical problem of a displacement-controlled crack in a strip, which played central roles in understanding material failure. We show that steady-state frictional cracks in a strip geometry require a nonmonotonic dependence of the frictional strength on the slip velocity and, in sharp contrast to their classical counterparts, feature a vanishing stress drop. Here, rupture is driven by energy flowing to its edge from behind, generated by an excess power of the external stress, and to be accompanied by an increase in the stored elastic energy, in qualitative contrast to the classical counterpart that is driven by the release of elastic energy stored ahead of the propagating edge. Finally, we derive a complete set of mesoscopic and macroscopic scaling relations for frictional cracks in a strip geometry and demonstrate that the stress singularity near their edges is proportional to $(\Delta{v}/c_{\rm r})\sqrt{H}$, where $\Delta{v}$ is the slip velocity rise accompanying their propagation.</description>

      <title>Extending the FDTD GVADE method nonlinear polarization vector to include anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the finite-difference time-domain general vector auxiliary differential equation method [Greene, J. H. and A. Taflove, Opt. Express 14, 8305 (2006)], nonlinear polarization vector, the nonlinear electric dipole moment per unit volume, is extended to include anisotropy, in nonlinear isotropic media at optical frequencies. The theory is presented for extending the method in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and then simulation results are presented for the simplified 2D transverse magnetic case, revisiting the fused silica example introduced in the 2006 paper including the anisotropic part of the nonlinear polarization vector. The simulation results including the anisotropic part of the polarization vector were compared with isotropic polarization vector simulation results.</description>
