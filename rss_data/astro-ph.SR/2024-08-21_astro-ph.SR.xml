      <title>A Study of Stochastic Low-Frequency Variability for Galactic O-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explore how the ubiquitous stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability of O-type stars is related to various stellar characteristics, we compiled a sample of 150 O-type stars observed via ground-based spectroscopic surveys, alongside photometric data obtained from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We analyzed 298 light curves obtained from TESS sectors 1-65 for the stars in our sample. Leveraging the spectroscopic parameters, we used Bonnsai to determine masses, radii, fractional main sequence ages, and mass-loss rates for stars of our sample. Subsequently, we identified possible correlations between the fitted parameters of SLF variability and stellar properties. Our analysis unveiled four significant correlations between the amplitude and stellar parameters, including mass, radius, fractional main sequence ages, and mass-loss rate. For stars with $M \gtrsim 30 M_{\odot}$, we observed a decrease in characteristic frequency and steepness with increasing radius. Finally, we compared various physical processes that may account for the SLF variability with our results. The observed SLF variability may arise from the combined effects of FeCZ and IGWs, with IGWs potentially more dominant in the early stages of stellar evolution, and the contribution of FeCZ becoming more significant as stars evolve. Meanwhile, our results indicate that the SLF variability of O-type stars bears certain signatures of the line-driven wind instability and granulation.</description>

      <title>Anomalously low-mass core-He-burning star in NGC 6819 as a post-common-envelope phase product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise masses of red-giant stars enable a robust inference of their ages, but there are cases where these age estimates are highly precise yet very inaccurate. Examples are core-helium-burning (CHeB) stars that have lost more mass than predicted by standard single-star evolutionary models. Members of star clusters in the ${\it Kepler}$ database represent a unique opportunity to identify such stars, because they combine exquisite asteroseismic constraints with independent age information. In this work we focus on the single, metal-rich, Li-rich, low-mass, CHeB star KIC4937011, which is a member of the open cluster NGC 6819 (turn-off mass of $\approx 1.6 \, M_\odot$, i.e. age of $\approx 2.4$ Gyr). This star has $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ less mass than expected for its age and metallicity, which could be explained by binary interactions or mass-loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). To infer formation scenarios for this object, we perform a Bayesian analysis by combining the binary stellar evolutionary framework $\texttt{binary_c v2.2.3}$ with the dynamic nested sampling approach contained in the $\texttt{dynesty v2.1.1}$ package. We find that this star is likely the result of a common-envelope evolution (CEE) phase during the RGB stage of the primary star in which the low-mass ($&lt;0.71 \, M_\odot$) main sequence companion does not survive. During the CEE phase $\approx 1 \, M_\odot$ of material is ejected from the system, and the final star reaches the CHeB stage after helium flashes as if it were a single star of mass $\approx 0.7 \, M_\odot$, which is what we observe today. Although the proposed scenario is consistent with photometric and spectroscopic observations, a quantitative comparison with detailed stellar evolution calculations is needed to quantify the systematic skewness of radius, luminosity, and effective temperature distributions towards higher values than observations.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing between light curves of ellipsoidal variables with massive dark companions, contact binaries, and semidetached binaries using principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric methods for identifying dark companion binaries - binary systems hosting quiescent black holes and neutron stars - operate by detecting ellipsoidal variations caused by tidal interactions. The limitation of this approach is that contact and semidetached binaries can produce similarly looking light curves. In this work, we address the degeneracy of ellipsoidal light curves by studying the differences between synthetically generated light curves of dark companion, semidetached, and contact binary systems. We inject the light curves with various levels of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise to simulate the effects of instrumental noise and stellar spots. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and Fourier decomposition, we construct low-dimensional representations of the light curves. We find that the first two to five PCA components are sufficient to explain $99\%$ of variance in the data. The PCA representations are generally more informative than the Fourier representation for the same number of coefficients as measured by both the silhouette scores of the representations and the macro recalls of random forest classifiers trained on the representations. The random forest classifiers reach macro recalls from $0.97$ to $0.70$, indicating that the classes remain largely separable even under adverse conditions. We find that instrumental noise significantly impacts the class separation only when its standard deviation exceeds $10^{-3}$ mag, whereas the presence of spots can markedly reduce the class separation even when they contribute as little as $1\%$ of the light curve amplitude. We discuss the application of our method to real ellipsoidal samples, and we show that we can increase the purity of a sample of dark companion candidates by a factor of up to $27$ if we assume a prior purity of $1\%$, significantly improving the cost-efficiency of follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of the photospheric cut-off on the p-mode frequency stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-photospheric acoustic resonators allow for the formation of standing p-mode oscillations by reflecting acoustic waves with frequencies below the acoustic cut-off frequency. We employ the Klein-Gordon equation with a piecewise acoustic potential to study the characteristic frequencies of intermediate-degree p-modes, modified by the cut-off effect. For a perfectly reflective photosphere, provided by the infinite value of the acoustic cut-off frequency, characteristic discrete frequencies of the trapped p-modes are fully prescribed by the width of the acoustic potential barrier. Finite values of the acoustic cut-off frequency result in the reduction of p-mode frequencies, associated with the decrease in the sound speed by the cut-off effect. For example, for a spherical degree of $\ell = 100$, characteristic p-mode frequencies are found to decrease by up to 200 $\mu$Hz and the effect is more pronounced for higher radial harmonics. The frequency separation between two consecutive radial harmonics is shown to behave non-asymptotically with non-uniform spacing in the radial harmonic number due to the cut-off effect. We also show how the 11-yr variability of the Sun's photospheric magnetic field can result in the p-mode frequency shifts through the link between the acoustic cut-off frequency and the plasma parameter $\beta$. Using this model, we readily reproduce the observed typical amplitudes of the p-mode frequency shift and its phase behaviour relative to other 11-yr solar cycle proxies. The use of the developed model for comparison with observations requires its generalisation for 2D effects, more realistic profiles of the acoustic potential, and broad-band stochastic drivers.</description>

      <title>Massive stellar triples on the edge: A numerical study of the evolution and final outcomes of destabilized massive triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars reside predominantly in triples or higher-order multiples. Their lives can be significantly affected by three-body interactions, making it an important area of study in the context of massive star evolution. In this study we provide a statistical overview of the lives and final outcomes of destabilized massive triples. A population of initially stable triples with a massive primary star are evolved from the zero-age main sequence using the code TRES, which combines stellar evolution with orbit-averaged dynamics. The triples that become unstable are transferred to a direct N-body code where they are simulated until the system disintegrates. This excludes systems undergoing mass transfer, such that the instability is caused by stellar winds or supernovae. Two suites of N-body simulations are performed; one with gravity as the only interaction, and one with stellar evolution included. We find that collisions occur in 35 - 40% of systems, with the variation coming from whether stellar evolution is included. The collisions mainly involve two main sequence stars (70 - 78%) or a main sequence and post-main sequence star (13 - 28%). We estimate a Galactic rate of collisions due to massive triple destabilization at 1.1 - 1.3 events per Myr. Furthermore, we find that the process of destabilization often ends in the ejection of one of the stellar bodies, specifically for 31 - 40% of systems. The ejected bodies have typical velocities of around 6 km/s, with a tail stretching to 102 km/s. If we assume that 20% of massive stars are runaway stars, then 0.1% of runaways originate from triple destabilization. Overall, our simulations show that triple instability affects approximately 2% of massive triples. However, we estimate that up to ten times as many systems can become unstable due to mass transfer in the inner binary, and these system may end up ejecting bodies at higher velocities.</description>

      <title>The variable stars population of the extended young globular cluster NGC 1851</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report VI CCD photometry of the globular cluster cluster NGC 1851. We aim to study the membership of the variable stars detected in the field of the cluster as listed in the Catalogue of Variable stars in Globular Clusters (CVSGC; Clement et al. 2001) and reported by the Gaia mission. We cross match the two sets of variables to produce light curves that lead to the estimation of physical parameters. The resulting colour-magnitude diagram (CMD), free of likely field stars, enables to confirm the position of the variables, their type and evolutionary stage. We provide new estimations of the period using data acquired on a long timebase. The Fourier decomposition of cluster member RR Lyrae light curves lead to a mean metalicity and distance of \([Fe/H]_{ZW} = -1.35 \pm 0.22\) dex and \(11.9 \pm 0.6\) kpc. The variability and membership of stars reported by Gaia-DR3 as variables in the field of the cluster is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Three Galactic Wolf-Rayet Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are evolved massive stars in the brief stage before they undergo core collapse. Not only are they rare, but they also can be particularly difficult to find due to the high extinction in the Galactic plane. This paper discusses the discovery of three new Galactic WRs previously classified as H$\alpha$ emission stars, but thanks to Gaia spectra, we were able to identify the broad, strong emission lines that characterize WRs. Using the Lowell Discovery Telescope and the DeVeny spectrograph, we obtained spectra for each star. Two are WC9s, and the third is a WN6 + O6.5 V binary. The latter is a known eclipsing system with a 4.4 day period from ASAS-SN data. We calculate absolute visual magnitudes for all three stars to be between -7 and -6, which is consistent with our expectations of these subtypes. These discoveries highlight the incompleteness of the WR census in our local volume of the Milky Way and suggest the potential for future Galactic WR discoveries from Gaia low-dispersion spectra. Furthermore, radial velocity studies of the newly found binary will provide direct mass estimates and orbital parameters, adding to our knowledge of the role that binarity plays in massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>On the surface distribution of chromium in Ap star HD 152564</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic and photometric variability of magnetic Ap/Bp stars is caused by the surface inhomogeneities of their chemical composition (spots) that affect the structure of the atmosphere and the emergent flux. Interpretation and modeling of the variability of Ap/Bp stars requires careful consideration of the surface distribution of the principal elements which contribute to opacity in a given temperature range. In this paper we present the results of a study of the horizontal distribution of chromium in the atmosphere of Ap star HD 152564 reconstructed with the Doppler Imaging technique. We reveal that the region of increased chromium abundance forms a ring perpendicular to the rotational equator. The passage of these regions across the visible hemisphere of the star should contributes to the observed light variability. Comparison with the previously obtained results shows that the character of the horizontal distribution of chromium in the atmosphere of HD 152564 is different from distribution of other investigated elements, which in turn also possess a significant diversity.</description>

      <title>Coherent radio emission from 'Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters': a new stellar diagnostic to probe 3D magnetospheric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters (MRPs) are magnetic early-type stars that produce coherent radio emission observed in the form of periodic radio pulses. The emission mechanism behind is the Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission (ECME). Amongst all kinds of magnetospheric emission, ECME is unique due to its high directivity and intrinsically narrow bandwidth. The emission is also highly circularly polarized and the sign of polarization is opposite for the two magnetic hemispheres. This combination of properties makes ECME highly sensitive to the three-dimensional structures in the stellar magnetospheres. This is especially significant for late-B and A-type magnetic stars that do not emit other types of magnetospheric emission such as Halpha, the key probe used to trace magnetospheric densities. In this paper, we use ultra-wideband observation (0.4-2 GHz) of a late B-type MRP HD 133880 to demonstrate how we can extract information on plasma distribution from ECME. We achieve this by examining the differences in pulse arrival times ('lags') as a function of frequencies, and qualitatively comparing those with lags obtained by simulating ECME ray paths in hot stars' magnetospheres. This reveals that the stellar magnetosphere has a disk-like overdensity inclined to the magnetic equator with a centrally concentrated density that primarily affects the intermediate frequencies (400-800 MHz). This result, which is consistent with recent density model proposed for hotter centrifugally supported magnetospheres, lends support to the idea of a unifying model for magnetospheric operations in early-type stars, and also provides further motivation to fully characterize the ECME phenomenon in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Microlensing brown-dwarf companions in binaries detected during the 2022 and 2023 seasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on previous works to construct a homogeneous sample of brown dwarfs in binary systems, we investigate microlensing events detected by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey during the 2022 and 2023 seasons. Given the difficulty in distinguishing brown-dwarf events from those produced by binary lenses with nearly equal-mass components, we analyze all lensing events detected during the seasons that exhibit anomalies characteristic of binary-lens systems. Using the same criteria consistently applied in previous studies, we identify six additional brown dwarf candidates through the analysis of lensing events KMT-2022-BLG-0412, KMT-2022-BLG-2286, KMT-2023-BLG-0201, KMT-2023-BLG-0601, KMT-2023-BLG-1684, and KMT-2023-BLG-1743. An examination of the mass posteriors shows that the median mass of the lens companions ranges from 0.02 $M_\odot$ to 0.05 $M_\odot$, indicating that these companions fall within the brown-dwarf mass range. The mass of the primary lenses ranges from 0.11 $M_\odot$ to 0.68 $M_\odot$, indicating that they are low-mass stars with substantially lower masses compared to the Sun.</description>

      <title>Straight outta photosphere: Open solar flux without coronal modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The open solar flux, that is, the total magnetic flux escaping the Sun, is one of the most important parameters connecting solar activity to the Earth. The open solar flux is commonly estimated from photospheric magnetic field measurements by making model assumptions about the solar corona. However, the question in which way the open solar flux is directly related to the distribution of the photospheric magnetic field is still partly unknown. We aim to reconstruct the open solar flux directly from the photospheric magnetic fields without making any assumptions about the corona and without using coronal hole observations, for instance. We modified an earlier vector sum method by taking magnetic field polarities into account and applied the method to the synoptic magnetograms of six instruments to determine the open solar flux from solar cycles 21-24. Results. The modified vector sum method produces a vector of the global solar magnetic field whose magnitude closely matches the open solar flux from the potential field source surface (PFSS) model both by the absolute scale and the overall time evolution for each of the six magnetograms. The latitude of this vector follows the Hale cycle by always pointing toward the dominantly positive-polarity hemisphere, and its longitude coincides with the location of the main coronal holes of the McIntosh Archive. We find multi-year periods during which the longitude of the vector slowly drifts or stays rather stationary in the Carrington frame. These periods are punctuated by times when the longitude moves rapidly in the Carrington frame. By comparing the magnitude of this vector to the open solar flux calculated from the PFSS model with different source surface heights, we find that the best match is produced with a source surface height $R_{ss} = 2.4 - 2.5R_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Variability and stellar pulsation incidence in Am/Fm stars using TESS and Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to study chemically peculiar Am and Fm stars, distinguished by their unique abundance patterns, which are crucial for studying mixing processes in intermediate-mass stars. These stars provide a window into the atomic diffusion in their stellar envelopes, the evolution-dependent changes in mixing, and the resulting effects on pulsation mechanisms. Methods. This study examines the pulsation characteristics of the Am/Fm star group. Our analysis encompasses 1276 stars (available as catalogues on GitHub), utilising data from TESS and Gaia and focusing on stars from the Renson catalogue. Results. In our sample, 51% (649 stars) display no variability, thus categorised as constant stars. Among the remaining, 25% (318 stars) are pulsating Am/Fm and {\rho} Puppis stars, including 20% (261 stars) that are exclusively Am/Fm stars. Additionally, 17% (210 stars) show variability indicative of binarity and/or rotational modulation and 7% (93 stars) are eclipsing binaries. Of the pulsating stars, 10% (32 stars) are {\gamma} Doradus type, 54% (172 stars) {\delta} Scuti type, and 36% (114 stars) are hybrids, underlining a diverse pulsational behaviour of Am/Fm stars. Conclusions. Our findings indicate that pulsating stars predominantly occupy positions near the red edge of the classical instability strip, allowing us to ascertain the incidence of pulsations in this stellar population.</description>

Abstract: The outcome of the formation of massive stars is an important anchor point in their evolution. It provides insight into the physics of the assembly process, and sets the conditions for stellar evolution. We characterize a population of 18 highly reddened O4.5 to B9 stars in the very young massive star-forming region M17. Their properties allow us to identify the empirical location of the ZAMS, and rotation and mass-loss rate of stars there. We performed quantitative spectroscopic modeling of VLT/X-shooter spectra using NLTE atmosphere code Fastwind and fitting approach Kiwi-GA. The observed SEDs were used to determine the line-of-sight extinction. From a comparison of their positions in the HRD with MIST evolutionary tracks, we inferred the stellar masses and ages. We find an age of $0.4_{-0.2}^{+0.6}$ Myr for our sample, however we also identify a strong relation between the age and the mass of the stars. The extinction towards the sources ranges from $A_V = 3.6$ to 10.6. Stars more massive than 10 M$_{\odot}$ have reached the ZAMS. Their projected ZAMS spin rate distribution extends to 0.3 of the critical velocity; their mass-loss rates agree with those of other main-sequence OB stars. Stars with a mass in the range $3 &lt; M/$M$_{\odot} &lt; 7$ are still on the pre-main sequence (PMS). Evolving their $v \sin i$ to the ZAMS yields values up to $\sim 0.6 v_{\rm crit}$. For PMS stars without disks, we find tentative mass-loss rates up to $10^{-8.5}\,$M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$. We constrain the empirical location of the ZAMS for massive ($10 &lt; M/$M$_{\odot} &lt; 50$) stars. The ZAMS rotation rates for intermediate-mass stars are twice as high as for massive stars, suggesting that the angular momentum gain processes differ between the two groups. The relation between the age and mass of the stars suggests a lag in the formation of more massive stars relative to lower mass stars.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Evolution of Plumes</title>

Abstract: Plumes are considered to play an important role in the origin of solar wind. However, an understanding of their thermodynamic evolution is not complete. Here, we perform a detailed study of a plume inside a coronal hole throughout its lifetime, using the observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). We find that the plume's formation is preceded by frequent occurrences of small-scale jets and jet-lets at its base, leading to the gradual development of plume haze. The plume rapidly developed within the first six hours into its well-known morphology. Light curves from all EUV channels exhibit a similar profile, suggesting its multi-thermal nature and intensity modulation over its lifespan. Moreover, the photospheric magnetic field dynamics at the plume's base are highly correlated with its light curve in 171~{\AA}. We calculate outflow velocities, observed prominently in the 171~{\AA} passband and mildly in the 193~{\AA} and 211~{\AA} passbands, with median speeds lower in higher temperature bands but occasionally comparable to the respective sound speeds. When data is averaged over larger spatial scales, the plume appears iso-thermal along its length, with constant temperature throughout its lifetime. However, an analysis of the differential emission measure at full resolution reveals the presence of higher-temperature plasma, indicating internal temperature structures within the plume. These results provide new insights into the formation, dynamics, and thermal properties of coronal plumes, placing tighter constraints on models to understand their thermodynamic evolution and potential role in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>EWOCS-II: X-ray properties of the Wolf-Rayet stars in the young Galactic super star cluster Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most comprehensive and deepest X-ray study to date of the properties of the richest Wolf-Rayet (WR) population observed in a single stellar cluster, Westerlund 1 (Wd1). This work is based on 36 Chandra observations obtained from the "Extended Westerlund 1 and 2 Open Clusters Survey" (EWOCS) project, plus 8 archival Chandra observations. The overall exposure depth (~1.1 Ms) and baseline of the EWOCS observations extending over more than one year enable us to perform a detailed photometric, colour, and spectral analysis, as well as to search for short- and long-term periodicity. In X-rays, we detect 20 out of the 24 known Wolf-Rayet stars in Wd1 down to an observed luminosity of ~7$\times10^{29}$erg s$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 4.23 kpc to Wd1), with 8 WR stars being detected in X-rays for the first time. Nine stars show clear evidence of variability over the year-long baseline, with clear signs of periodicity. The X-ray colours and spectral analysis reveal that the vast majority of the WR stars are hard X-ray sources (kT$\geq$2.0keV). The Fe XXV emission line at ~6.7 keV, which commonly originates from the wind-wind collision zone in binary systems, is detected for the first time in the spectra of 17 WR stars in Wd1. In addition the ~6.4 keV fluorescent line is observed in the spectra of three stars, indicating that dense cold material coexists with the hot gas in these systems. Overall, our X-ray results alone suggest a very high binary fraction ($\geq$80%) for the WR star population in Wd1. When combining our results with properties of the WR population from other wavelengths, we estimate a binary fraction of $\geq$92%, which could even reach unity. This suggests that either all the most massive stars are found in binary systems within Wd1, or that binarity is essential for the formation of such a rich population of WR stars.</description>

      <title>A GTC spectroscopic study of three spider pulsar companions: line-based temperatures, a new face-on redback, and improved mass constraints</title>

Abstract: We present GTC-OSIRIS phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of three compact binary MSPs, or `spiders': PSR J1048+2339, PSR J1810+1744, and (for the first time) PSR J1908+2105. For the companion in each system, the temperature is traced throughout its orbit, and radial velocities are measured. The radial velocities are found to vary with the absorption features used when measuring them, resulting in a lower radial velocity curve semi-amplitude measured from the day side of two of the systems when compared to the night: for J1048 ($K_\mathrm{day} = 344 \pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{night} = 372 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$) and, tentatively, for J1810 ($K_\mathrm{day} = 448 \pm 19$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{night} = 491 \pm 32$ km s$^{-1}$). With existing inclination constraints, this gives the neutron star (NS) and companion masses $M_\mathrm{NS} = 1.50 - 2.04$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.32 - 0.40$ $M_\odot$ for J1048, and $M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 1.7$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.05 - 0.08$ $M_\odot$ for J1810. For J1908, we find an upper limit of $K_2 &lt; 32$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains its mass ratio $q = M_2 / M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 0.55$ and inclination $i &lt; 6.0^\circ$, revealing the previously misunderstood system to be the highest mass ratio, lowest inclination redback yet. This raises questions for the origins of its substantial radio eclipses. Additionally, we find evidence of asymmetric heating in J1048 and J1810, and signs of metal enrichment in J1908. We also explore the impact of inclination on spectroscopic temperatures, and demonstrate that the temperature measured at quadrature ($\phi = 0.25, 0.75$) is essentially independent of inclination, and thus can provide additional constraints on photometric modelling.</description>

      <title>A white dwarf binary showing sporadic radio pulses at the orbital period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed rare, previously unknown flashes of cosmic radio waves lasting from milliseconds to minutes, and with periodicity of minutes to an hour [1-4]. These transient radio signals must originate from sources in the Milky Way, and from coherent emission processes in astrophysical plasma. They are theorised to be produced in the extreme and highly magnetised environments around white dwarfs or neutron stars [5-8]. However, the astrophysical origin of these signals remains contested, and multiple progenitor models may be needed to explain their diverse properties. Here we present the discovery of a transient radio source, ILT J1101+5521, whose roughly minute-long pulses arrive with a periodicity of 125.5 minutes. We find that ILT J1101+5521 is an M dwarf - white dwarf binary system with an orbital period that matches the period of the radio pulses, which are observed when the two stars are in conjunction. The binary nature of ILT J1101+5521 establishes that some long-period radio transients originate from orbital motion modulating the observed emission, as opposed to an isolated rotating star. We conclude that ILT J1101+5521 is likely a polar system where magnetic interaction has synchronised the rotational and orbital periods of the white dwarf [9]. Magnetic interaction and plasma exchange between the two stars may generate the sporadic radio emission. Such mechanisms have been previously theorised [10-13], but not observationally established.</description>

      <title>Survey of Complex Organic Molecules in Starless and Prestellar Cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold ($\sim$10 K) and dense ($\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$) cores of gas and dust within molecular clouds, known as starless and dynamically evolved prestellar cores, are the birthplaces of low-mass ($M$ $\leq$ few M$_\odot$) stars. As detections of interstellar complex organic molecules, or COMs, in starless cores has increased, abundance comparisons suggest that some COMs might be seeded early in the star formation process and inherited to later stages (i.e., protostellar disks and eventually comets). To date observations of COMs in starless cores have been limited, with most detections reported solely in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. It is therefore still a question whether different environments affect abundances. We have surveyed 35 starless and prestellar cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope detecting both methanol, CH$_3$OH, and acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO, in 100% and 49% of the sample, respectively. In the sub-sample of 15 cores where CH$_3$CHO was detected at $&gt;3\sigma$ ($\sim$18 mK) with the ARO 12m, follow-up observations with the Yebes 40m telescope were carried out. Detections of formic acid, $t$-HCOOH, ketene, H$_2$CCO, methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, vinyl cyanide, CH$_2$CHCN, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl ether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, are seen in at least $20\%$ of the cores. We discuss detection statistics, calculate column densities, and compare abundances across various stages of low-mass star formation. Our findings have more than doubled COM detection statistics in cold cores and show COMs are prevalent in the gas before star and planet formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.</description>

      <title>A JWST MIRI MRS View of the $\eta$ Tel Debris Disk and its Brown Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report JWST MIRI MRS observations of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group member, $\eta$ Telescopii ($\eta$ Tel) A and its brown dwarf binary companion, $\eta$ Tel B. Following PSF subtraction, we recover the spatially resolved flux from the debris disk around $\eta$ Tel A, along with the position of the companion exterior to the disk. We present a new 5-26 $\mu$m epoch of spectroscopy for the disk, in which we discover a 20 $\mu$m silicate feature. We also present the first ever 11-21 $\mu$m spectrum of $\eta$ Tel B, which indicates a bare photosphere. We derive a new epoch of relative astrometry for the companion, extending the baseline of measurements to 25 years, and find that its current location is consistent with the apocentre of an eccentric, long-period orbit. The companion's orbit is close enough to the disk that it should significantly perturb the planetesimals within it, resulting in a detectable mid-IR pericentre glow and near-alignment with the companion. Contrary to expectations, however, we find that the disk appears to be axisymmetric and potentially misaligned with the companion in the MIRI MRS data. We posit that this may be due to the presence of an additional, yet-undetected 0.7-30 $M_J$ planet orbiting interior to the disk with a semi-major axis of 3-19 au.</description>

      <title>K2-399 b is not a planet. The Saturn that wandered through the Neptune desert is actually a hierarchical eclipsing binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transit technique has been very efficient in detecting planet candidate signals over the past decades. The so-called statistical validation approach has become a popular way of verifying a candidate's planetary nature. However, the incomplete consideration of false positive scenarios and data quality can lead to the misinterpretation of the results. In this work we revise the planetary status of K2-399\,b, a validated planet with an estimated false positive probability of 0.078% located in the middle of the so-called Neptunian desert, and hence a potential key target for atmospheric prospects. We use radial velocity data from the CARMENES, HARPS and TRES spectrographs, as well as ground-based multi-band transit photometry LCOGT MuSCAT3 and broad band photometry to test the planetary scenario. Our analysis of the available data does not support the existence of this (otherwise key) planet, and instead points to a scenario composed of an early G-dwarf orbited in a $846.62^{+0.22}_{-0.28}$~days period by a pair of eclipsing M-dwarfs (hence a hierarchical eclipsing binary) likely in the mid-type domain. We thus demote K2-399 b as a planet. We conclude that the validation process, while very useful to prioritise follow-up efforts, must always be conducted with careful attention to data quality while ensuring that all possible scenarios have been properly tested to get reliable results. We also encourage developers of validation algorithms to ensure the accuracy of a priori probabilities for different stellar scenarios that can lead to this kind of false validation. We further encourage the use of follow-up observations when possible (such as radial velocity and/or multi-band light curves) to confirm the planetary nature of detected transiting signals rather than only relying on validation tools.</description>

      <title>Embedding Ordinality to Binary Loss Function for Improving Solar Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel loss function aimed at optimizing the binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to $+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts, leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multi-species ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach $E_{max} \sim 0.1$ - $1$ MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio $E_{max} \propto (Q/M)^\alpha$. When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasilinear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that $\alpha \sim 0.4$, which is somewhat smaller than $\alpha \sim 0.7$ observed by PSP.</description>

      <title>Connecting stellar and galactic scales: Energetic feedback from stellar wind bubbles to supernova remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy and momentum feedback from stars is a key element of models for galaxy formation and interstellar medium dynamics, but resolving the relevant length scales to directly include this feedback remain out of reach of current-generation simulations. We aim to constrain the energy feedback by winds, photoionisation and supernovae (SNe) from massive stars. We measure the thermal and kinetic energy imparted to the interstellar medium on various length scales, calculated from high-resolution 1D radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Our grid of simulations covers a broad range of densities, metallicities, and state-of-the-art evolutionary models of single and binary stars. We find that a single star or binary system can carve a cavity of tens-of-pc size into the surrounding medium. During the pre-SN phase, post-main-sequence stellar winds and photoionisation dominate. While SN explosions dominate the total energy budget, the pre-SN feedback is of great importance by reducing the circumstellar gas density and delaying the onset of radiative losses in the SN remnant. Contrary to expectations, the metallicity dependence of the stellar wind has little effect on the cumulative energy imparted by feedback to the ISM; the only requirement is the existence of a sufficient level of pre-SN radiative and mechanical feedback. The ambient medium density determines how much and when feedback energy reaches to distance $\gtrsim 10-20$ pc and affects the division between kinetic and thermal feedback. Our results can be used as a sub-grid model for feedback in large-scale simulations of galaxies. The results reinforce that the uncertain mapping of stellar evolution sequences to SN explosion energy is very important to determining the overall feedback energy from a stellar population.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Supernova 1987A Shock Breakout</title>

Abstract: Shock breakout is the first electromagnetic signal from supernovae (SNe), which contains important information on the explosion energy and the size and chemical composition of the progenitor star. This paper presents the first two-dimensional (2D) multi-wavelength radiation hydrodynamics simulations of SN 1987A shock breakout by using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code with the opacity table, $\texttt{OPAL}$, considering eight photon groups from infrared to X-ray. To investigate the impact of the pre-supernova environment of SN 1987A, we consider three possible circumstellar medium (CSM) environments: a steady wind, an eruptive mass loss, and the existence of a companion star. In sum, the resulting breakout light curve has an hour duration and its peak luminosity of $\sim 4\times 10^{46}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ then following a decay rate of $\sim 3.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ in X-ray. The dominant band transits to UV around 3 hours after the initial breakout, and its luminosity has a decay rate of $\sim 1.5\,\rm{mag\,hour^{-1}}$ that agrees well with the observed shock breakout tail. The detailed features of breakout emission are sensitive to the pre-explosion environment. Furthermore, our 2D simulations demonstrate the importance of multidimensional mixing and its impacts on shock dynamics and radiation emission. The mixing emerging from the shock breakout may lead to a global asymmetry of SN ejecta and affect its later supernova remnant formation.</description>

Abstract: Submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities. In this report we summarise the science that is guiding the design of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). We demonstrate how tranformational advances in topics including star formation in high redshift galaxies, the diffuse circumgalactic medium, Galactic ecology, cometary compositions and solar flares motivate the need for a 50m, single-dish telescope with a 1-2 degree field of view and a new generation of highly multiplexed continuum and spectral cameras. AtLAST will have the resolution to drastically lower the confusion limit compared to current single-dish facilities, whilst also being able to rapidly map large areas of the sky and detect extended, diffuse structures. Its high sensitivity and large field of view will open up the field of submillimeter transient science by increasing the probability of serendipitous detections. Finally, the science cases listed here motivate the need for a highly flexible operations model capable of short observations of individual targets, large surveys, monitoring programmes, target of opportunity observations and coordinated observations with other observatories. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned submillimeter observatories.</description>
