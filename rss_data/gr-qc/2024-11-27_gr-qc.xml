      <title>Gravitational waves driven by Holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the effects of holographic dark energy on the evolution of gravitational waves. The background evolution of gravitational waves in a flat FRW universe is considered and studied in the presence of various holographic dark energy models. The perturbation equations governing the evolution of the gravitational waves have been constructed and solutions are obtained. These solutions are studied in detail to get a proper understanding of the characteristics of the gravitational waves in the presence of holographic dark energy. The work can be a significant tool in studying different dark energy models comparatively using the features of the gravitational wave evolution.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of relativistic dissipative stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous fluids can dissipate and alter the propagation of gravitational waves, as well as modify the relaxation and stability properties of self-gravitating fluids. This is particularly relevant in order to understand the relaxation to equilibrium of neutron stars, and their gravitational wave emission. Here we study the linearized theory of perturbations of spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluids. Dissipative effects are included through the hydrodynamics theory of Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK). This theory has been shown to be causal and stable, despite involving only first order gradients. We show how the problem reduces to two coupled wave equations in the axial sector, one of them associated to a novel viscous mode, and including explicitly dissipative terms. In the polar sector, we reduce the problem to five coupled wave equations and one additional constraint. We comment on their causal structure, and recover the causality bounds of the BDNK theory.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution for the motion of spinning particles in Kerr space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of motion of massive test particles near Kerr black holes are separable in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, as established by Carter. This separability, however, is lost when the particles are endowed with classical spin. We show that separability of the equations of motion can be recovered to linear order in spin by a shift of the worldline derived with the use of the hidden symmetry of Kerr space-time. Consequently, the closed-form solution of the motion is expressed in a way closely analogous to the solution for spinless particles. This finding enriches the understanding of separability and integrability properties of the dynamics of test particles and fields in Kerr space-time, and is particularly valuable for modeling inspirals of rotating compact objects into massive black holes.</description>

      <title>The dynamical response of viscous objects to gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical response of viscous materials to gravitational waves, in the context of a fully relativistic theory of fluid dynamics. For the first time, we calculate oscillation modes and scattering properties of viscous stars. Viscous stars absorb high frequency radiation, following a dispersion relation introduced by Press. In the extremely large viscosity regime, stars would become reflectors of waves, but this regime appears to be forbidden by causality bounds. In the context of black hole mimickers, we show how maximally viscous stars on the threshold of stability mimic the absorption of a black hole with the same mass. Our results suggest that rotating viscous stars will amplify incoming radiation.</description>

      <title>Geodesic motion of a test particle around a noncommutative Schwarzchild Anti-de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive non-commutative corrections to the Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter solution up to the first and second orders of the non-commutative parameter $\Theta$. Additionally, we obtain the corresponding deformed effective potentials and the non-commutative geodesic equations for massive particles. Through the analysis of time-like non-commutative geodesics for various values of $\Theta$, we demonstrate that the circular geodesic orbits of the non-commutative Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole exhibit greater stability compared to those of the commutative one. Furthermore, we derive corrections to the perihelion deviation angle per revolution as a function of $\Theta$. By applying this result to the perihelion precession of Mercury and utilizing experimental data, we establish a new upper bound on the non-commutative parameter, estimated to be on the order of $10^{-66}\,\mathrm{m}^2$.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet dynamical compactification scenarios and their ghosts in the tensor sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a cosmological context, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory contains, in $d+4$ dimensions, a dynamical compactification scenario in which the additional dimensions settle down to a configuration with a constant radion/scale factor. Sadly however this work demonstrates that such a quite appealing framework is plagued by instabilities, either from the background configuration's unsteadiness or the ghostly behaviors of the tensorial perturbations. New and stable solutions are found by relaxing one of the hypotheses defining the original compactification scenario. However, such configurations do not respect the current bounds on the speed of propagation of gravitational waves, and thus have to be discarded. Those results thus advocate for a comprehensive study of compactification scenarios in the Gauss-Bonnet framework, their stability, and the effects of matter inclusion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and cosmic boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detectors have the capability to detect signals from very high redshifts. It is interesting to know if such capability can be used to study the global structure of the cosmic space. In this paper, we focus on one particular question: if there exists a reflective cosmic boundary at the high redshift ($z&gt;15$), is it possible to find it? We find that, with the current level of technology: 1) gravitational waves appear to be the only means with which that signatures from the cosmic boundary can possibly be detected; 2) a large variety of black holes, with masses roughly in the range $(10^3\sim 10^6) {\rm~M_\odot}$, can be used for the task; 3) in the presumably rare but physically possible case that two merger events from the growth history of a massive black hole are detected coincidentally, a detector network like TianQin+LISA is essential in help improving the chance to determine the orientation of the cosmic boundary; 4) the possibility to prove or disprove the presence of the cosmic boundary largely depends on how likely one can detect multiple pairs of coincident gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Probing vector gravitational atom with eccentric intermediate mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter, are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we investigate the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Friedmann-Lema\^itre universes and their metamorphoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre universes taking into account the different roles played by the fluid parameter and the cosmological constant, as well as the degenerate character of the equations. We find that the Friedmann-Lema\^itre system reduces to four qualitatively inequivalent normal forms and write down the sets of all stable perturbations that may result (the `versal unfoldings'). These sets are of small codimension up to three. We then describe all possible parameter-dependent solutions and their transfigurations to other forms during evolution through the bifurcation sets, these are also fully described. This analysis leads to a picture of cosmological evolution determined by new parameters related to codimension which are zero in standard cosmology. The emerging versal solutions are all free of singularities, while other properties of them are also discussed.</description>

      <title>The general property of the tensor gravitational memory effect in theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that based on the linear analysis, as long as a theory of gravity is diffeomorphism invariant and possesses the tensor degrees of freedom propagating at a constant, isotropic speed without dispersion, its asymptotic symmetry group of an isolated system contains the (extended/generalized) Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. The tensor gravitational wave induces the displacement, spin and center-of-mass memory effects. They depend on the asymptotic shear tensor. The displacement memory effect is the vacuum transition and parameterized by a supertranslation transformation. All of these hold even when the Lorentz symmetry is broken by a special timelike direction.</description>

      <title>On turbulence for spacetimes with stable trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting stably trapped null geodesics, such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic (defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.
  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.
  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.</description>

      <title>Lessons for loop quantum gravity from emergent modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the potential physical effects of loop quantum gravity have been derived in effective models that modify the constraints of canonical general relativity in specific forms. Emergent modified gravity evaluates important conditions that ensure the existence of a compatible geometrical space-time interpretation of canonical solutions, as well as phase-space covariance under different choices of canonical variables. This setting, specialized to modifications suggested by loop quantum gravity, is therefore an important contribution to physical evaluations of this approach to quantum gravity. Here, it is shown that emergent modified gravity restricts several ambiguities that existed in previous formulations, rules out several specific candidates, and provides a unified treatment of different types of (holonomy) modifications that had been thought to be physically distinct.</description>

      <title>Inflation with an Anomalyon and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Class $\mathcal{S}$ superconformal indices from maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new gauging of maximal supergravity in five spacetime dimensions with gauge group containing ISO(5), involving the local scaling symmetry of the metric, and admitting a supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum. We show this maximal supergravity to arise by consistent truncation of M-theory on the (non-spherical, non-parallelisable) six-dimensional geometry associated to a stack of $N$ M5-branes wrapped on a smooth Riemann surface. The existence of this truncation allows us to holographically determine the complete, universal spectrum of light operators of the dual four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory of class $\mathcal{S}$. We then compute holographically the superconformal index of the dual field theory at large-$N$, finding perfect agreement with previously known field theory results in specific limits.</description>

      <title>Tidal Resonance in Binary Neutron Star Inspirals: A High-Precision Study in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal resonance of the fundamental ($f$-)mode in spinning neutron stars, robustly tracing the onset of the excitation to its saturation, using numerical relativity for the first time. We performed long-term ($\approx15$~orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the $f$-mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasi-circular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The $f$-mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of $\gtrsim6.3\%$ in the linear regime and much more as $\sim33\%$ during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of $\lesssim40$~radians is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.</description>

      <title>An entropic puzzle in periodic dilaton gravity and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 2d dilaton gravity theories with a periodic potential, with special emphasis on sine dilaton gravity, which is holographically dual to double-scaled SYK. The periodicity of the potentials implies a symmetry under (discrete) shifts in the momentum conjugate to the length of geodesic slices. This results in divergences. The correct definition is to gauge this symmetry. This discretizes the geodesic lengths. Lengths below a certain threshold are null states. Because of these null states, the entropy deviates drastically from Bekenstein-Hawking and the Hilbert space becomes finite dimensional. The spacetimes have a periodic radial coordinate. These are toy models of 2d quantum cosmology with a normalizable wavefunction. We study two limiting dualities: one between flat space quantum gravity and the Heisenberg algebra, and one between topological gravity and the Gaussian matrix integral. We propose an exact density of states for certain classes of periodic dilaton gravity models.</description>

      <title>Tensor global symmetries and the Stueckelberg mechanism for tensor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of tensor global symmetries, featuring conserved currents of mixed symmetry and higher spin Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We develop a Stueckelberg mechanism for mixed symmetry tensor fields at the linearized level, focusing on the massive graviton, the massive $(2,1)$ Curtright field and the massive $(2,2)$ field. Counting degrees of freedom, we identify the set of fields that necessarily appear in the gauge invariant Stueckelberg action in each case. These fields transform under shift symmetries and they are a vector and a scalar in the first case, a graviton, a Kalb-Ramond field and a vector in the second case and a Curtright field and a graviton in the third case. The analysis results in gauge invariant and fully conserved currents of mixed symmetry for the corresponding gauge theories, which are linked to their tensor global symmetries and they can be minimally coupled to suitable background fields. Viewing the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field as Nambu-Goldstone bosons for constant symmetric and antisymmetric shift symmetries, we use a nonminimal coupling to uncover a 't Hooft anomaly in linearized gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The final stage of black hole evaporation is a potent probe of physics beyond the Standard Model: Hawking-Bekenstein radiation may be affected by quantum gravity "memory burden effects", or by the presence of "dark", beyond-the-Standard-Model degrees of freedom in ways that are testable with high-energy gamma-ray observations. We argue that information on either scenario can best be inferred from measurements of the evaporation's lightcurve and by correlating observations at complementary energies. We offer several new analytical insights in how such observations map on the fundamental properties of the evaporating black holes and of the possible exotic particles they can evaporate into.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of the one-dimensional power spectrum of 21-cm forest based on a halo model method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Short-duration gamma-ray bursts from Kerr-Newman black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) mergers are natural sources of gravitational waves (GWs) and are possibly associated with electromagnetic events. Such events from a charged rotating BH with an accretion on to it could be more energetic and ultra-short-lived if the magnetic force dominates the accretion process because the attraction of ionized fluid with a strong magnetic field around the rotating BH further amplifies the acceleration of the charged particle via a gyromagnetic effect. Thus a stronger magnetic field and gravitational pull will provide an inward force to any fluid displaced in the radial direction and move it toward the axis of rotation with an increasing velocity. After many twists during rotation and the existence of restoring agents, Such events could produce a narrow intense jet starts in the form of Poynting flux along the axis of rotation resembling the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We investigated a charged rotating BH and obtained characteristic results (e.g., the remnant mass, magnetic field strength, luminosity, opening angle, viewing angle, and variation of viewing angle on the SGRB luminosity detection) that have a nice coincidence with rare events having GW associated with EM counterparts. This study gives a new insight into events with a strongly magnetized disk dominating the accretion process of energy extraction.</description>

      <title>Constraints on color-flavored locked quark matter in view of the HESS J1731-347 event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the processes within compact stars hinges on astrophysical observations. A recent study reported on the central object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant (SNR), estimating a mass of $M=0.77_{-0.17}^{+0.20} \ M_{\odot}$ and a radius of $R=10.40_{-0.78}^{+0.86} \ \rm{km}$, making it the lightest neutron star ever observed. Conventional models suggest that neutron stars form with a minimum gravitational mass of about $1.17M_{\odot}$, raising the question: is this object a typical neutron star, or could it be our first encounter with an "exotic" star? To explore this, we employ the Color-Flavored Locked (CFL) equation of state (EoS), aiming to constrain it by integrating data from the HESS J1731-347 event with pulsar observations and gravitational wave detections. Additionally, we model hybrid EoS by combining the MDI-APR1 (hadronic) and CFL (quark) EoS, incorporating phase transitions via Maxwell construction. Our analysis indicates that CFL quark matter adequately explains all measurements, including the central compact object of HESS J1731-347. In contrast, hybrid models featuring CFL quark phases fail to account for the masses of the most massive observed pulsars.</description>

The model incorporates classical scale invariance and the irreversible vierbein postulate, which forbid the introduction of dimensionful parameters and a background spacetime at a particular scale.

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. We further analyse the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

Abstract: We show that, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the semiclassical energy-momentum tensor of the neutrino flavor vacuum fulfills the equation of state of dust and cold dark matter. We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes, and we demonstrate that, within the weak field approximation, the flavor vacuum contributes as a Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential. This corrected potential may account for the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. In this perspective, neutrino mixing could contribute to dark matter</description>

      <title>The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameter from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are hosts of surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances. The BINGO project is one such surveys, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield with the main telescope helped by a set of outrigger stations. This paper aims to simulate and estimate the potential of FRBs in constraining our current cosmological model. We present a forecast of the future constraints that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially located BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. Still, they will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs detected by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Hidden Adler zeros and soft theorems for inflationary perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \texttt{PSpectCosmo} is a high-performance \texttt{C++} program developed to investigate early-universe cosmological dynamics, with a specific emphasis on the inflationary epoch. Utilizing a Fourier-space pseudo-spectral method, \texttt{PSpectCosmo} enables the precise evolution of interacting scalar fields and gravitational waves, ensuring accurate representation of the power spectrum during inflation. This approach overcomes key limitations of finite difference methods, particularly in maintaining consistency between effective and lattice wave vectors. The code employs the adaptive step size velocity-Verlet algorithm for time integration, offering a balance of numerical stability and high precision. Additionally, \texttt{PSpectCosmo} incorporates a robust mechanism to compute convergent energy density, effectively resolving the issue of divergent energy density at the onset of inflation. These capabilities establish \texttt{PSpectCosmo} as a reliable and versatile tool for probing non-linear cosmological phenomena and inflationary dynamics with exceptional accuracy.

      <title>Accelerated nested sampling with $\beta$-flows for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for convergence by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows to accelerate nested sampling. Notably, $\beta$-flows successfully recover the same posteriors and evidences as traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extreme mass-ratio binary systems in which a stellar mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole surrounded by a scalar cloud. Scalar clouds can form through superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around spinning black holes and can also serve as a proxy for dark matter halos. Our framework is fully relativistic and assumes that the impact of the cloud on the geometry can be treated perturbatively. As a proof of concept, here we consider a point particle in circular, equatorial motion around a non-spinning black hole surrounded either by a spherically symmetric or a dipolar non-axisymmetric scalar cloud, but the framework can in principle be generalized to generic black hole spins and scalar cloud geometries. We compute the leading-order power lost by the point particle due to scalar radiation and show that, in some regimes, it can dominate over gravitational-wave emission. We confirm the presence of striking signatures due to the presence of a scalar cloud that had been predicted using Newtonian approximations, such as resonances that can give rise to sinking and floating orbits, as well as "sharp features" in the power lost by the particle at given orbital radii. Finally, for a spherically symmetric scalar cloud, we also compute the leading-order corrections to the black-hole geometry and to the gravitational-wave energy flux, focusing only on axial metric perturbations for the latter. We find that, for non-compact clouds, the corrections to the (axial) gravitational-wave fluxes at high frequencies can be understood in terms of a gravitational-redshift effect, in agreement with previous works.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the apparent horizon finding problem with multigrid methods</title>

Abstract: Apparent horizon plays an important role in numerical relativity as it provides a tool to characterize the existence and properties of black holes on three-dimensional spatial slices in 3+1 numerical spacetimes. Apparent horizon finders based on different techniques have been developed. In this paper, we revisit the apparent horizon finding problem in numerical relativity using multigrid-based algorithms. We formulate the nonlinear elliptic apparent horizon equation as a linear Poisson-type equation with a nonlinear source, and solve it using a multigrid algorithm with Gauss-Seidel line relaxation. A fourth order compact finite difference scheme in spherical coordinates is derived and employed to reduce the complexity of the line relaxation operator to a tri-diagonal matrix inversion. The multigrid-based apparent horizon finder developed in this work is capable of locating apparent horizons in generic spatial hypersurfaces without any symmetries. The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\sim 1^\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The McVittie metric does not describe a physical black hole in an expanding universe because the curvature scalar and pressure at its event horizon are infinite. We show that extending this metric to an inhomogeneous scale factor, which depends on both the time and radial coordinate, removes those infinities by imposing the constancy of the Hubble parameter at the horizon. We also show that the Hubble parameters at the event horizons of all centrally symmetric black holes without accreting matter are equal to the same constant $H_\textrm{hor}=(\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$. Because of this equality and the equivalence to the Kottler metric near the horizon, black holes do not grow with the universe expansion. Black holes with accretion are described by this extension with different values of $H_\textrm{hor}$.</description>

      <title>Observational prospects of self-interacting scalar superradiance with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation gravitational-wave observatories may reveal new, ultralight bosons. Through the superradiance process, these theoretical particle candidates can form clouds around astrophysical black holes and result in detectable gravitational-wave radiation. In the absence of detections, constraints$-$contingent on astrophysical assumptions$-$have been derived using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data on boson masses. However, the searches for ultralight scalars to date have not adequately considered self-interactions between particles. Self-interactions that significantly alter superradiance dynamics are generically present for many scalar models, including axion-like dark matter candidates and string axions. We implement the most complete treatment of particle self-interactions available to determine the gravitational-wave signatures expected from superradiant scalar clouds and revisit the constraints obtained in a past gravitational-wave search targeting the black hole in Cygnus X-1. We also project the reach of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to scalar particle parameter space in the mass-coupling plane. We find that while proposed observatories have insufficient reach to self-interactions that can halt black hole spin-down, next-generation observatories are essential for expanding the search beyond gravitational parameter space and can reach a mass and interaction scale of $\sim 10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ eV/c$^2$ and $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in the generalized SU(2) Proca theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generalized SU(2) Proca theory is a vector-tensor modified gravity theory characterized by an action that remains invariant under both diffeomorphisms and global internal transformations of the SU(2) group. This study aims to further explore the physical properties of the theory within astrophysical contexts. Previous investigations have unveiled intriguing astrophysical solutions, including particle-like configurations and black holes. The purpose of this work is to constrain the theory's free parameters by modeling realistic neutron stars. To that end, we have assumed solutions that are static, spherically symmetric, and have adopted the t'Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole configuration for the vector fields. Employing both analytical techniques, such as asymptotic expansions, and numerical methods involving solving boundary value problems, we have obtained neutron star solutions whose baryonic matter is described by realistic equations of state for nuclear matter. Furthermore, we have constructed mass-radius relations which reveal that neutron stars exhibit greater compactness in comparison with general relativity predictions for most of the solutions we have found and for the employed equations of state. Finally, we have found out solutions where the mass of the star is greater than $\sim$ 2.5 $M_\odot$; this result poses an alternative in the exploration of the mass gap of compact stellar objects.</description>

      <title>Neutral particle collisions near Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes after shadow observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole with a magnetic charge (or an electric charge) has noteworthy features that its scalar curvature near the event horizon of the black hole with the almost maximal charge can be extremely large. The large curvature, which is related with the gravity on a finite-sized object or between two points, causes high center-of-mass energy for two neutral particles near the almost maximally charged GMGHS black hole. Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration gave the bound on the charge of black holes from the shadow and mass observations of black holes under an assumption that the diameter of observed rings are proportion to that of photon spheres. The photon sphere would be less related with the curvature, since it is determined by the behavior of one photon or one ray neither two photons nor two rays. Thus, the high-energy neutral particle collision and the black hole shadow observations would be complementary to distinguish the GMGHS black hole from other black hole solutions. In this paper, we investigate a new way to compare the center-of-mass energy for neutral particle collisions in the GMGHS spacetime and other black hole spacetimes. From the shadow observations and the mass observations under the assumptions on the effect of black hole charges, we can put constraints on the center-of-mass energy of the particles. We apply our method to shadow and mass observations of M87* and Sagittarius A*. We find that the center-of-mass energy of neutral particles near the GMGHS black holes cannot be extremely large under the observational constraints, and conclude that the GMGHS spacetimes are hardly distinguishable from the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m spacetimes by the particle collisions if we apply the shadow and mass observations at $1 \sigma$ probability.</description>

Abstract: The Tolman-Ehrenfest criterion of thermal equilibrium for a static fluid in a static spacetime is generalized to stationary heat conduction, in the approximation in which backreaction is negligible. Applying this generalized criterion to the Hawking radiation in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry shows that the two horizons (which act as thermostats) remain in thermal equilibrium. The temperature of the radiation fluid interpolates between the temperatures at the horizons, with a static analytic profile that is given explicitly.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Scattering Theory for Asymptotically de Sitter Vacuum Solutions in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a definitive quantitative nonlinear scattering theory for asymptotically de Sitter solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations in $(n+1)$ dimensions with $n\geq4$ even, which are determined by small scattering data at the spacelike asymptotic boundaries $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+.$ The case of even spatial dimension $n$ poses significant challenges compared to its odd counterpart and was left open by the previous works in the literature. Here, scattering theory is understood to mean existence and uniqueness of scattering states, asymptotic completeness, and the existence of an invertible scattering map with quantitative control on its norm. The existence and uniqueness of scattering states imply that for any small asymptotic data there exists a unique global solution to the Einstein equations, which remains close to the de Sitter metric. Asymptotic completeness is the converse statement, showing that any such solution induces asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and at $\mathscr{I}^+.$ For sufficiently small asymptotic data, we construct the scattering map $\mathscr{S}$ taking data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ to data at $\mathscr{I}^+,$ and we show that the map $\mathscr{S}$ is locally invertible and locally Lipschitz at the de Sitter data, with respect to a Sobolev-type norm.
  The scattering map result is sharp and avoids any "derivative loss", in the sense that we measure the smallness of asymptotic data at $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ using the same Sobolev norm. The proof of the sharp result requires a detailed analysis of the Einstein equations involving a geometric Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the solution, carried out in our companion paper.</description>

      <title>A new rotating Lorentzian wormhole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard Newman-Janis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-A\"inou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a $R=0$ spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features {\em vis-a-vis} the Kerr geometry and available EHT observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection and subsequent inference of binary black hole signals rely heavily on the accuracy of the waveform model employed. In the highly non-linear, dynamic, and strong-field regime near merger, these waveforms can only be accurately modeled through numerical relativity simulations. Considering the precision requirements of next-generation gravitational wave observatories, we present in this paper high-resolution simulations of four non-spinning quasi-circular binary black hole systems with mass ratios of 1, 2, 3, and 4, conducted using the GR-Athena++ code. We extract waveforms from these simulations using both finite radius and Cauchy characteristic extraction methods. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive error analysis to evaluate the accuracy and convergence of the waveforms. This dataset encompasses gravitational waves of the precision (self-mismatch) demanded by upcoming gravitational detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. The waveforms are publicly available on ScholarSphere, and represent the first set of waveforms of the new GR-Athena++ catalog.</description>

      <title>Influence of Observer Inclination and Spacetime Structure on Photon Ring Observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of the near-horizon regions of BHs, particularly the images captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, have greatly advanced our understanding of gravity in extreme conditions. These images reveal a bright, ring-like structure surrounding the central dark area of supermassive BHs, created by the images of unstable photon orbits. As observational capabilities improve, future studies are expected to resolve higher-order rings, providing new opportunities to test gravity through observables such as the Lyapunov exponent, time delay, and azimuthal shift. These observables offer valuable insights into the structure of spacetime, BH properties, and the inclination of the observer. In this study, we employ a non-perturbative and non-parametric framework to examine how these observables change with deviations from the no-hair theorem and varying inclinations. We focus particularly on polar observers, which are highly relevant for the supermassive compact object at the centre of the galaxy M87. Our analysis explores how each of these observables can reveal information about the structure of spacetime and the morphology and existence of the ergosphere and event horizon. Furthermore, we illustrate this characterization for several specific alternative spacetimes, investigating how these current and potential future measurements, including those of the shadow size, can provide direct insights into the spin parameter values for each of these spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On generalized black brane solutions in the model with multicomponent anisotropic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1706</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.1706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of spherically $O(d_0 + 1)$-symmetric solutions in the model with $m$-component anisotropic fluid is obtained. The metrics are defined on a manifold which contains a product of $n-1$ Ricci-flat ``internal'' spaces. The equation of state for any $s$-th component is defined by a vector $U^s = (U^s_i)$ belonging to $R^{n + 1}$ and obeying inequalities $U^s_1 = q_s &gt; 0$, $s = 1, \ldots,m$. The solutions are governed by moduli functions $H_s$ which are solutions to (master) non-linear differential equations with certain boundary conditions imposed. It is shown that for coinciding $q_s = q$ there exists a subclass of solutions with a horizon when $q = 1, 2, \ldots$ and $U^s$-vectors correspond to certain semisimple Lie algebras. An extension of these solutions to block-orthogonal set of vectors $U^s$ with natural parameters $q_s$ coinciding inside blocks is also proposed. $q$-analogues of black brane/hole solutions are presented, e.g. generalising $M_2 \cap M_5$ dyonic solution in $D =11$ supergravity and Myers-Perry charged black hole solution in dimension $D = 2 + d_0$.</description>

      <title>From existing and new nuclear and astrophysical constraints to stringent limits on the equation of state of neutron-rich dense matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through continuous progress in nuclear theory and experiment and an increasing number of neutron-star observations, a multitude of information about the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities is available. To constrain the EOS across its entire density range, this information needs to be combined consistently. However, the impact and model-dependency of individual observations vary. We present a broad compendium of different constraints and apply them individually to a large set of EOS candidates within a Bayesian framework. Specifically, we explore different ways how chiral effective field theory and perturbative quantum chromodynamics can be used to place a likelihood on EOS candidates. We also investigate the impact of nuclear experimental constraints, as well as different radio and X-ray observations of neutron star (NS) masses and radii. This is augmented by reanalyses of the existing data from BNS coalescences, in particular of GW170817, with improved models for the tidal waveform and kilonova light curves, which we also utilize to construct a tight upper limit of 2.39$\,$M$_\odot$ on the TOV mass based on GW170817's remnant. Our diverse set of constraints is eventually combined to obtain stringent limits on NS properties. We organize the combination in a way to distinguish between constraints where the systematic uncertainties are deemed small and those that rely on less conservative assumptions. For the former, we find the radius of the canonical 1.4$\,$M$_\odot$ neutron star to be $R_{1.4}= 12.26_{-0.91}^{+0.80}\,$km and the TOV mass at $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.25_{-0.22}^{+0.42}\,$M$_\odot$ (95% credibility). Including all the presented constraints yields $R_{1.4}= 12.20_{-0.48}^{+0.50}\,$km and $M_{\rm TOV}= 2.30_{-0.20}^{+0.07}\,$M$_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes ($\gamma$) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in $1/\gamma^2$ and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing $\gamma$. Below a critical value of $\gamma$, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite $\gamma$ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition.</description>

      <title>Quantum-corrected anti-de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the back-reaction of a quantum scalar field on anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. The renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a massless, conformally-coupled quantum scalar field on global AdS space-time in four space-time dimensions acts as a source term on the right-hand-side of the Einstein equations for the quantum-corrected metric. We solve the quantum-corrected Einstein equations numerically and find deviations from pure AdS which increase as the temperature of the quantum scalar field state increases. We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectra of black hole X-ray binaries with returning radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the disk-corona model, the X-ray spectrum of a stellar-mass black hole in an X-ray binary is characterized by three components: a thermal component from a thin and cold accretion disk, a Comptonized component from a hot corona, and a reflection component produced by illumination of the cold disk by the hot corona. In this paper, we assume a lamppost corona and we improve previous calculations of the X-ray spectrum of black hole X-ray binaries. The reflection spectrum is produced by the direct radiation from the corona as well as by the returning radiation of the thermal and reflection components and is calculated considering the actual spectrum illuminating the disk. If we turn the corona off, the reflection spectrum is completely generated by the returning radiation of the thermal component, as it may happen for some sources in soft spectral states. After choosing the radial density profile of the accretion disk, the ionization parameter is calculated self-consistently at any radial coordinate of the disk from the illuminating X-ray flux and the local electron density. We show the predictions of our model in different regimes and we discuss its current limitations as well as the next steps to improve it.</description>

      <title>Probe and Prejudice: Classification of compact objects and model comparison using EOS knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear theory and experiments, alongside astrophysical observations, constrain the equation of state (EOS) of supranuclear-dense matter. Conversely, knowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or astrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on the EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the nature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR J0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\gtrsim 84\%$ and $\gtrsim 68\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase to above $95\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV mass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially disfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when combining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot models. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on measurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value predicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other constraints on the EOS.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infer the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we find that PBHs are ruled out within the mass range $\sim[10^{-24},10^{-19}]M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-16}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The model-independent evidence of cosmic acceleration revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the null tests of cosmic accelerated expansion by using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find that the DESI BAO data provide strong evidence that the Universe has undergone accelerated expansion within the redshift range [0, 1.317]. Using Gaussian Process, we reconstruct the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from the DESI BAO $F_{AP}(z)$ data, revealing that accelerated expansion persisted until $z \lesssim 0.7$ with a 99.7\% confidence level. Additionally, to provide insights into the Hubble tension problem, we propose to reconstruct $E(z)$ from the DESI BAO $F_{AP}$ data and then combine the reconstructed $E(z)$ with $D_H/r_d$ data to derive the model independent result $r_d h=100.3\pm 1.5$ Mpc. The result is consistent with that obtained from the measurements on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies using the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also propose a model-independent method for reconstructing $D_M(z)$ from SNe Ia data and combining the result with DESI BAO data of $D_M/r_d$ to constrain the value of $r_d$. We find that the value of $r_d$ derived from this model-independent method is smaller than that obtained from CMB measurements, with a significant discrepancy of at least 4.17$\sigma$. All the conclusions drawn in this paper are independent of cosmological models and gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. In the context of field theory, it is more appropriate to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy through the Wick rotation of the twist operators. It is found that, in certain special cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is related to the commutator of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. To evaluate these commutators, we employ the operator product expansion of the twist operators, revealing that the commutator is generally universal across most scenarios. However, in more general cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy proves to be more complex. We compute the commutator of the twist operators along with its higher-order temporal derivatives. Utilizing these results, we derive a modified formula for the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extend this formula to the case of strip subregion in higher dimensions. Our analysis shows that for the strip geometry, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is solely related to the commutators of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. The findings presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy and its physical significance.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills Field in the $\kappa$-space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>
