      <title>New estimates for numerical radius in $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several numerical radius inequalities in the framework of $C^*$-algebras are proved in this paper. These results, which are based on an extension of Buzano inequality for elements in a pre-Hilbert $C^*$-module, generalize earlier numerical radius inequalities.</description>

      <title>Borel fields and measured fields of Polish spaces, Banach spaces, von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several recent articles in operator algebras make a nontrivial use of the theory of measurable fields of von Neumann algebras $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ and related structures. This includes the associated field $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ of automorphism groups and more general measurable fields of Polish groups with actions on Polish spaces. Nevertheless, a fully rigorous and at the same time sufficiently broad and flexible theory of such Borel fields and measurable fields is not available in the literature. We fill this gap in this paper and include a few counterexamples to illustrate the subtlety: for instance, for a Borel field $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ of von Neumann algebras, the field of Polish groups $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ need not be Borel.</description>

      <title>An extension of Krishnan's central limit theorem to the Brown-Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a central limit theorem, recently established for the Thompson group $F=F_2$ by Krishnan, to the Brown-Thompson groups $F_p$, where $p$ is any integer greater than or equal to $2$. The non-commutative probability space considered is the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[F_p]$, equipped with the canonical trace. The random variables in question are $a_n:= (x_n + x_n^{-1})/\sqrt{2}$, where $\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}$ represents the standard family of infinite generators. Analogously to the case of $F=F_2$, it is established that the limit distribution of $s_n = (a_0 + \ldots + a_{n-1})/\sqrt{n}$ converges to the standard normal distribution.
  Furthermore, it is demonstrated that for a state corresponding to Jones's oriented subgroup $\vec{F}$, such a central limit theorem does not hold.</description>

      <title>Rokhlin Dimension and Inductive Limit Actions on AF-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a separable, AF-algebra A and an inductive limit action on A of a finitely generated abelian group with finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers, we give a local description of the associated crossed product C*-algebra. In particular, when A is unital and $\alpha \in Aut(A)$ is approximately inner and has the Rokhlin property, we conclude that $A \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb{Z}$ is an A$\mathbb{T}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ converges strongly to a family $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ in a $C^*$-algebra if $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x})\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a central role in several recent breakthrough results on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, strong convergence is notoriously difficult to prove and has generally required delicate problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a detailed understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Mond-Pecaric Method with Applications to Hypercomplex Function Sobolev Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mond and Pecaric introduced a method to simplify the determination of complementary inequalities for Jensen's inequality by converting it into a single-variable maximization or minimization problem of continuous functions. This principle has significantly enriched the field of operator inequalities. Our contribution lies in extending the Mond-Pecaric method from single-input operators to multiple-input operators. We commence by defining normalized positive linear maps, accompanied by illustrative examples. Subsequently, we employ the Mond-Pecaric method to derive fundamental inequalities for multivariate hypercomplex functions bounded by linear functions. These foundational inequalities serve as the basis for establishing several multivariate hypercomplex function inequalities, focusing on ratio relationships. Additionally, we present similar results based on difference relationships. Finally, we apply the derived multivariate hypercomplex function inequalities to establish Sobolev embedding via Sobolev inequality for hypercomplex functions with operator inputs.</description>

      <title>Rokhlin Dimension: Permanence Properties and Ideal Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Rokhlin dimension for actions of residually finite groups on C*-algebras. We give a definition equivalent to the original one due to Szabo, Wu and Zacharias. We then prove a number of permanence properties and discuss actions on C_0(X)-algebras and commutative C*- algebras. Finally, we use a theorem of Sierakowski to show that, for an action with finite Rokhlin dimension, every ideal in the associated reduced crossed product C*-algebra arises from an invariant ideal of the underlying algebra.</description>

      <title>A minimal completion theorem and almost everywhere equivalence for Completely Positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A problem of completing a linear map on C*-algebras to a completely positive map is analyzed. It is shown that whenever such a completion is feasible there exists a unique minimal completion. This theorem is used to show that under some very general conditions a completely positive map almost everywhere equivalent to a quasi-pure map is actually equal to that map.</description>

      <title>Non-free almost finite actions for locally finite-by-virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study almost finiteness and almost finiteness in measure of non-free actions. Let $\alpha:G\curvearrowright X$ be a minimal action of a locally finite-by-virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ group $G$ on the Cantor set $X$. We prove that under certain assumptions, the action $\alpha$ is almost finite in measure if and only if $\alpha$ is essentially free. As an application, we obtain that any minimal topologically free action of a virtually $\mathbb{Z}$ group on an infinite compact metrizable space with the small boundary property is almost finite. This is the first general result, assuming only topological freeness, in this direction, and these lead to new results on uniform property $\Gamma$ and $\mathcal{Z}$-stability for their crossed product $C^*$-algebras. Some concrete examples of minimal topological free (but non-free) subshifts are provided.</description>

Abstract: We characterise Geometric Property (T) by the existence of a certain projection in the maximal uniform Roe algebra $C_{u,\max}^*(X)$, extending the notion of Kazhdan projection for groups to the realm of metric spaces. We also describe this projection in terms of the decomposition of the metric space into coarsely connected components.</description>

      <title>Multiplier algebras of $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the multiplier algebra of an approximately unital and nondegenerate $L^p$-operator algebra is again an $L^p$-operator algebra. In this paper we investigate examples that drop both hypotheses. In particular, we show that the multiplier algebra of $T_2^p$, the algebra of strictly upper triangular $2 \times 2$ matrices acting on $\ell_2^p$, is still an $L^p$-operator algebra for any $p$. To contrast this result, we first provide a thorough study of the augmentation ideal of $\ell^1(G)$ for a discrete group $G$. We use this ideal to define a family of non approximately unital degenerate $L^p$-operator algebras, $F_{r,0}^p(\Bbb{Z}/3\Bbb{Z})$, whose multiplier algebras cannot be represented on any $L^q$-space for any $q \in [1, \infty)$ as long as $p \in [1, p_0] \cup [p_0', \infty)$, where $p_0=1.606$ and $p_0'$ is its H\"older conjugate.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>
