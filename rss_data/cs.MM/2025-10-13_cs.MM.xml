      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Driven Edge Management for Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links, and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot image privacy classification with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods. Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image perturbations.</description>

      <title>Iola Walker: A Mobile Footfall Detection System for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01211v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This outing is part of a larger music technology research project. The objective is to find a method for materially enhancing music using hardware and software. There is a strong likelihood that there exists a new medium for experiencing music via a wearable device that ordinary listeners prefer over the current state of the art. If such a medium is discovered, it is a step towards altruistic, prosocial reform in the music industry. A new playback system infrastructure has a chance to soothe some of the societal problems tied to the larger entertainment industry ecosystem. Iola walker is a music playback system that allows musicians to compose music that changes in accordance with the listener's gait.

      <title>AniME: Adaptive Multi-Agent Planning for Long Animation Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present AniME, a director-oriented multi-agent system for automated long-form anime production, covering the full workflow from a story to the final video. The director agent keeps a global memory for the whole workflow, and coordinates several downstream specialized agents. By integrating customized Model Context Protocol (MCP) with downstream model instruction, the specialized agent adaptively selects control conditions for diverse sub-tasks. AniME produces cinematic animation with consistent characters and synchronized audio visual elements, offering a scalable solution for AI-driven anime creation.</description>
