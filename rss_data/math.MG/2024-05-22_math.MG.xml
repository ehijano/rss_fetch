      <title>Directed Metric Structures arising in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are transformer neural networks which are trained to produce a probability distribution on the possible next words to given texts in a corpus, in such a way that the most likely word predicted is the actual word in the training text. In this paper we find what is the mathematical structure defined by such conditional probability distributions of text extensions. Changing the view point from probabilities to -log probabilities we observe that the subtext order is completely encoded in a metric structure defined on the space of texts $\mathcal{L}$, by -log probabilities. We then construct a metric polyhedron $P(\mathcal{L})$ and an isometric embedding (called Yoneda embedding) of $\mathcal{L}$ into $P(\mathcal{L})$ such that texts map to generators of certain special extremal rays. We explain that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is a $(\min,+)$ (tropical) linear span of these extremal ray generators. The generators also satisfy a system of $(\min+)$ linear equations. We then show that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is compatible with adding more text and from this we derive an approximation of a text vector as a Boltzmann weighted linear combination of the vectors for words in that text. We then prove a duality theorem showing that texts extensions and text restrictions give isometric polyhedra (even though they look a priory very different). Moreover we prove that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is the lattice closure of (a version of) the so called, Isbell completion of $\mathcal{L}$ which turns out to be the $(\max,+)$ span of the text extremal ray generators. All constructions have interpretations in category theory but we don't use category theory explicitly. The categorical interpretations are briefly explained in an appendix. In the final appendix we describe how the syntax to semantics problem could fit in a general well known mathematical duality.</description>

      <title>On Lipschitz partitions of unity and the Assouad--Nagata dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the standard partition of unity subordinate to an open cover of a metric space has Lipschitz constant $\max(1,M-1)/\mathcal{L}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lebesgue number and $M$ is the multiplicity of the cover. If the metric space satisfies the approximate midpoint property, such as length spaces do, then the upper bound improves to $(M-1)/(2\mathcal{L})$. These Lipschitz estimates are optimal. We also address the Lipschitz analysis of $\ell^{p}$-generalizations of the standard partition of unity, their partial sums, and their categorical products. Lastly, we characterize metric spaces with Assouad--Nagata dimension $n$ as exactly those metric spaces for which every Lebesgue cover admits an open refinement with multiplicity $n+1$ while reducing the Lebesgue number by at most a constant factor.</description>

      <title>The Quantitative Fractional Helly theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two celebrated extensions of Helly's theorem are the Fractional Helly theorem of Katchalski and Liu (1979) and the Quantitative Volume theorem of B\'ar\'any, Katchalski, and Pach (1982). Improving on several recent works, we prove an optimal combination of these two results. We show that given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $n$ convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that at least $\alpha \binom{n}{d+1}$ of the $(d+1)$-tuples of $\mathcal{F}$ have an intersection of volume at least 1, then one can select $\Omega_{d,\alpha}(n)$ members of $\mathcal{F}$ whose intersection has volume at least $\Omega_d(1)$.
  Furthermore, with the help of this theorem, we establish a quantitative version of the $(p,q)$ theorem of Alon and Kleitman. Let $p\geq q\geq d+1$ and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that among any $p$ elements of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ that have an intersection of volume at least $1$. Then, we prove that there exists a family $T$ of $O_{p,q}(1)$ ellipsoids of volume $\Omega_d(1)$ such that every member of $\mathcal{F}$ contains at least one element of $T$.
  Finally, we present extensions about the diameter version of the Quantitative Helly theoerm.</description>
