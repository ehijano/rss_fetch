      <title>Anti-chiral surface states and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger physics in rutile altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surface states and domain wall bound states in altermagnets using a rutile-lattice tight-binding model of electrons coupled to a N\'eel order. We discover that two symmetry-protected Weyl nodal lines in the bulk band structure can give rise to unconventional anti-chiral surface states -- surface states from opposite surfaces propagate in a \emph{parallel} manner, as opposed to the anti-parallel manner for the more conventional chiral surface states. We also find that the anti-chiral surface states can be turned into chiral surface states upon changing the surface termination. The origin of the surface states, the dependence on the surface termination, and key features of domain wall bound states are explained using a map from the altermagnet to a family of a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) chain and the associated bulk-boundary correspondence. Our work reveals rutile altermagnets as a promising candidate among very few quantum materials that can support anti-chiral surface states.</description>

      <title>The poor man's Majorana tetron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Majorana tetron is a prototypical topological qubit stemming from the ground state degeneracy of a superconducting island hosting four Majorana modes. This degeneracy manifests as an effective non-local spin degree of freedom, whose most paradigmatic signature is the topological Kondo effect. Degeneracies of states with different fermionic parities characterize also minimal Kitaev chains which have lately emerged as a platform to realize and study unprotected versions of Majorana modes, dubbed poor man's Majorana modes. Here, we introduce the ``poor man's Majorana tetron'', comprising four quantum dots coupled via a floating superconducting island. Its charging energy yields non-trivial correlations among the dots, although, unlike a standard tetron, it is not directly determined by the fermionic parity of the Majorana modes. The poor man's tetron displays parameter regions with a two-fold degenerate ground state with odd fermionic parity, that gives rise to an effective Anderson impurity model when coupled to external leads. We show that this system can approach a regime featuring the topological Kondo effect under a suitable tuning of experimental parameters. Therefore, the poor man's tetron is a promising device to observe the non-locality of Majorana modes and their related fractional conductance.</description>

      <title>Towards Advanced Chiral Sensors: Enhanced Helicity-Dependent Photocurrent in Ultrathin Topological Insulator Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, a fundamental property of asymmetric structures, plays a crucial role in pharmaceutical, biological and chemical systems, offering a powerful tool for screening organic compounds. While the conventional optical chirality detectors are often bulky and involuted, the topological insulators (TIs) offer a promising platform for developing compact yet sensitive devices - owing to their inherent chirality. However, the complex interplay of photoresponses in TIs can limit the ultimate accuracy of chirality detection. Therefore, we here analyze the underlying mechanisms governing the photoresponses in TIs and reveal strategies to enhance the helicity-dependent photocurrent (HDPC). By attentively analyzing the symmetries and behavior of competing photoresponses, we show that it is possible to effectively eliminate unwanted contributions and isolate the HDPC. Moreover, we reveal that HDPC is strongly amplified in ultrathin TI films, and can be further enhanced by optimizing the illumination parameters, sensor strain and/or back gating. Our findings thereby provide a roadmap for design and optimization of miniaturized, high-performance TI chirality detectors, with potential to revolutionize chiral analysis in biomedical and material sciences.</description>

      <title>Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D&lt;1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the theory of magnetic Skyrmions in chiral magnets in two dimensions to a higher-dimensional theory with magnetic Skyrmions in three dimensions and an $S^3$ target space, requiring a 4-dimensional magnetization vector. A physical realization of our theory necessitates the use of a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton. Including also the Skyrme term in theory enriches the spectrum to a small metastable Skyrmion, an unstable sphaleron and a large stable Skyrmion.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Coupling Regimes in Oscillator Systems via Tunable Open Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a system comprising two oscillators that are coupled to an open channel at distinct locations. The coupling nature can be adjusted to be coherent, dissipative, or a combination of both, controlled by a tunable phase resulting from wave propagation between the oscillators. This setup allows us to observe characteristic energy level behaviors: level repulsion occurs with coherent coupling, while level attraction is observed with dissipative coupling. In the regime of dissipative coupling, one of the eigenmodes becomes a dark mode, rendering it immune to external perturbations. By leveraging the tunable coupling through the open channel, we introduce a novel method for manipulating this dark mode, achieving both efficient excitation and an extended lifetime. Our results have broad applicability across various physical systems, including optical, acoustic, and magnetic configurations, underscoring the potential for innovative applications in mode storage and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Fractality-induced Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal geometries, characterized by self-similar patterns and non-integer dimensions, provide an intriguing platform for exploring topological phases of matter. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that leverages isospectral reduction to effectively simplify complex fractal structures, revealing the presence of topologically protected boundary and corner states. Our approach demonstrates that fractals can support topological phases, even in the absence of traditional driving mechanisms such as magnetic fields or spin-orbit coupling. The isospectral reduction not only elucidates the underlying topological features but also makes this framework broadly applicable to a variety of fractal systems. Furthermore, our findings suggest that these topological phases may naturally occur in materials with fractal structures found in nature. This work opens new avenues for designing fractal-based topological materials, advancing both theoretical understanding and experimental exploration of topology in complex, self-similar geometries.</description>

      <title>Step meandering: The balance between the potential well and the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive and innovative exploration of how the surface potential energy landscape influences meander formation. Using the Vicinal Cellular Automaton model, which distinguishes surface diffusion from adatom incorporation into the crystal, the research delves into various factors affecting surface pattern dynamics. By isolating the diffusion process within a defined energy potential, the study provides a detailed analysis of how changes in the potential energy well and the barrier at the top of the step contribute to meander formation. Remarkably, the results reveal that the mere presence of a potential well at the step's bottom is sufficient to induce meandering. The role of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier on already-formed meanders is further investigated, and a mechanism for meander formation is proposed to clarify this process. The derived relation accurately captures the meander length patterns observed in the simulations. Ultimately, the findings demonstrate that the shape of the surface energy potential plays a pivotal role in determining surface pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Phase transition from Weyl to knotted semimetal using bi-circular laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi surface topology of a triple non-hermitian (NH) Weyl semimetal (WSM) driven by bi-circularly polarized light is presented in this study. A NH WSM in particular has remarkable outlines. Bi-circular light, however, modifies the symmetry features of non-hermitian triple Weyl and causes an unusual new kind of band swapping. We observe swapping between the imaginary bands (with or without exceptional degenaracies), which causes unique Fermi surfaces in the form of double rings and knots. This is something never discussed before phase transition between Weyl and knotted phases. We also discuss the corresponding changes in the Berry curvature as well.</description>

      <title>MAViS: Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a Modular Automated Virtualization System (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multi-layer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>$\Delta T$-noise in Multiterminal Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of charge current fluctuations (noise) can give useful insights into the properties of nanoscale systems. In this work, the peculiar properties of noise in multiterminal hybrid normal-superconducting systems are explored in the thermal out-of-equilibrium regime, i.e., when temperature biases are present ($\Delta T$-noise). Using the Landauer-B\"uttiker approach, we identify two contributions: background noise and excess noise, analyzing them when both electrical and thermal biases are applied. When temperature biases are present, and superconducting terminals are grounded, we find that the first contribution depends not only on the electrical conductance, as the Johnson-Nyquist at equilibrium, but also on a quantity strictly related to the heat conductance. This is our first main result. On the other hand, the second contribution shows, as expected, additional terms originating from the partitioning of currents into different transport channels, including the ones associated with Andreev reflection processes. However, noise induced by the temperature differences unveil also interference terms that cannot be present either in voltage bias or in the absence of any Andreev processes. Finally, we apply the results obtained to two different specific physical situations. The first is a generic three-terminal normal-superconductor-normal system, and the second is a device based on spin-resolved co-propagating chiral channels in the integer quantum Hall regime with a superconducting region. In these example setups, we investigate mainly the shot-noise regimes, when high-voltage or high-temperature biases are applied. We find remarkable differences between the two limits, which ultimately show the different nature of electrically and thermally induced charge current fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method called the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF) to detect the complex frequency Green's function, $G(\omega\in\mathbb{C})$, in a driven-dissipative system. By utilizing the CFF, we can measure the complex frequency density of states (DOS) and local DOS (LDOS), providing unique insights into the characterization of non-Hermitian systems. By applying our method to systems exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), we demonstrate how to use our theory to detect both the non-Hermitian eigenvalues and eigenstates. This offers a distinctive and reliable approach to identifying the presence or absence of NHSE in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Implementation and performance of a fiber-coupled CMOS camera in an ultrafast reflective high-energy electron diffraction experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of a monolithic fiber-optically coupled CMOS-based TemCam-XF416 camera into our ultra-high vacuum (UHV) ultrafast reflection high-energy electron diffraction setup is reported. A combination of a pumpable gate valve and a self-built cooling collar allows UHV conditions to be reached without the need to remove the heat-sensitive device. The water-cooled collar is mounted to the camera housing and prevents heating of the detector upon bake-out of the UHV chamber. The TemCam provides an one order of magnitude higher spatial resolution than the previously used microchannel plate (MCP) based detector (Burle Chevron 3040FM) which enables a 30% higher resolution in reciprocal space. The low background intensity and the 4$\times$ lager dynamic range enables analysis of the diffuse intensity of the diffraction pattern like Kikuchi lines and bands. A key advantage over the previous MCP detector is the complete absence of the blooming effect, which enables the quantitative spot profile analysis of the diffraction spots. The inherent light sensitivity in an optical pump experiment can be overcome by using photons with h{\nu} &lt; 1.12 eV, i.e., the indirect band gap of silicon, or by shielding any stray light.</description>

      <title>On the microscopics of proximity effects in one-dimensional superconducting hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the microscopic details of the proximity effect is crucial for both key experimental applications and fundamental inquiries into nanoscale devices featuring superconducting elements. In this work, we develop a framework motivated by experiments to study induced superconducting correlations in hybrid nanoscale devices featuring layered superconductor-normal heterostructures using the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions. Following a detailed method for analyzing the induced pair amplitude in a prototypical one-dimensional hybrid, we provide insights into the proximity effect within and outside the Andreev approximation. Our analysis also uncovers a disorder-induced crossover in the correlation patterns of the system. By elucidating the spectral distribution of the induced pair amplitude, we investigate the pair correlations established in a recent experiment [Phys.Rev.Lett.128,127701], providing a theoretical basis for the enhanced Cooper pair injection demonstrated through the lens of the induced pair correlations, thereby establishing the promise of our methods in guiding new experiments in hybrid quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of $A$-type Antiferromagnetism and Chiral Split Magnons in Altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, where ferromagnetic layers couple antiferromagnetically, in the semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a subject of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits a nearest-neighbor in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous ab initio calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this Letter, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals an FM in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain reverses the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction and significantly enhances the spin and chiral splittings of the electronic and magnonic bands, respectively. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for complex spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Reward based optimization of resonance-enhanced piezoresponse spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: Dynamic spectroscopies in Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) are critical for probing material properties, such as force interactions, mechanical properties, polarization switching, and electrochemical reactions and ionic dynamics. However, the practical implementation of these measurements is constrained by the need to balance imaging time and data quality. Signal to noise requirements favor long acquisition times and high frequencies to improve signal fidelity. However, these are limited on the low end by contact resonant frequency and photodiode sensitivity, and on the high end by the time needed to acquire high-resolution spectra, or the propensity for samples degradation under high field excitation over long times. The interdependence of key parameters such as instrument settings, acquisition times, and sampling rates makes manual tuning labor-intensive and highly dependent on user expertise, often yielding operator-dependent results. These limitations are prominent in techniques like Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) that utilize multiple concurrent feedback loops for topography and resonance frequency tracking. Here, a reward-driven workflow is proposed that automates the tuning process, adapting experimental conditions in real time to optimize data quality. This approach significantly reduces the complexity and time required for manual adjustments and can be extended to other SPM spectroscopic methods, enhancing overall efficiency and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear ferroelectric and screw-type antiferroelectric phases in a metal-free hybrid molecular crystal</title>

Abstract: Noncollinear dipole textures greatly extend the scientific merits and application perspective of ferroic materials. In fact, noncollinear spin textures have been well recognized as one of the core issues of condensed matter, e.g. cycloidal/conical magnets with multiferroicity and magnetic skyrmions with topological properties. However, the counterparts in electrical polarized materials are less studied and thus urgently needed, since electric dipoles are usually aligned collinearly in most ferroelectrics/antiferroelectrics. Molecular crystals with electric dipoles provide a rich ore to explore the noncollinear polarity. Here we report an organic salt (H2Dabco)BrClO4 (H2Dabco = N,N'-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) that shows a transition between the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases. Based on experimental characterizations and ab initio calculations, it is found that its electric dipoles present nontrivial noncollinear textures with $60^\circ$-twisting angle between the neighbours. Then the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric transition can be understood as the coding of twisting angle sequence. Our study reveals the unique science of noncollinear electric polarity.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation with dissimilar quantum dots over a hybrid quantum network</title>

Abstract: Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing [1, 2], secure communication [3, 4], and the realization of a global quantum internet [5, 6]. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances [7]. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources [8-11], the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement all-photonic quantum teleportation among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction [12], multi-axial strain [13] and magnetic fields [14] so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a hybrid quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the University campus in the center of Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82+-1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Disordered Hyperuniformity in Confined Fluids and Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement can significantly alter fluid properties, offering potential for specific technological applications. However, achieving precise control over the structural complexity of confined fluids and soft matter remains challenging, as it often requires careful tuning of system parameters. In this study, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of a fluid confined in a slit pore, employing an interaction potential applicable to a broad range of soft matter. Confinement induces the fluid to form two-dimensional (2D) layers, each of which self-assembles into structures of varying complexity. Notably, we observe a suppression of large-scale density fluctuations-akin to crystals-within complex nontrivial fluid-like geometries, leading to the emergence of disordered hyperuniformity. We demonstrate that fluid properties can be precisely adjusted by modifying control parameters. This work provides a foundation for designing experimental protocols to regulate the structure of self-assembling materials, stabilize disordered hyperuniform structures, and facilitate the fabrication of 2D arrays with tailored complexity. Additionally, it offers a new perspective for analyzing biological monolayers, such as epithelial tissues.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the nucleation, dynamics, and stationary configurations of Abrikosov vortices in hybrid superconductor-ferromagnetic nanostructures exposed to inhomogeneous magnetic fields generated by a ferromagnetic nanodot. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations and Maxwell's equations, we observe and provide an explanation for the evolution of curved vortex structures that undergo creep-like deformation while reaching a steady state. Spatial variations in the Lorentz force, along with the interaction between geometric constraints and vortex interactions, give rise to unusual stationary vortex configurations that gradually change with increasing field strength, a behavior not seen in homogeneous magnetic fields. These findings reveal complex pinning mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the optimization and further advancement of nanoscale superconducting systems.</description>

      <title>Optothermally Induced Active and Chiral Motion of the Colloidal Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial soft matter systems have appeared as important tools to harness mechanical motion for microscale manipulation. Typically, this motion is driven either by the external fields or by mutual interaction between the colloids. In the latter scenario, dynamics arise from non-reciprocal interaction among colloids within a chemical environment. In contrast, we eliminate the need for a chemical environment by utilizing a large area of optical illumination to generate thermal fields. The resulting optothermal interactions introduce non-reciprocity to the system, enabling active motion of the colloidal structure. Our approach involves two types of colloids: passive and thermally active. The thermally active colloids contain absorbing elements that capture energy from the incident optical beam, creating localized thermal fields around them. In a suspension of these colloids, the thermal gradients generated drive nearby particles through attractive thermo-osmotic forces. We investigate the resulting dynamics, which lead to various swimming modes, including active propulsion and chiral motion. We have also experimentally validated certain simulated results. By exploring the interplay between optical forces, thermal effects, and particle interactions, we aim to gain insights into controlling colloidal behavior in non-equilibrium systems. This research has significant implications for directed self-assembly, microfluidic manipulation, and the study of active matter.</description>

      <title>How to Recognize Clustering of Luminescent Defects in Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising material platform for near-infrared in-vivo imaging, optical sensing, and single-photon emission at telecommunication wavelengths. The functionalization of SWCNTs with luminescent defects can lead to significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) properties due to efficient trapping of highly mobile excitons and red-shifted emission from these trap states. Among the most studied luminescent defect types are oxygen and aryl defects that have largely similar optical properties. So far, no direct comparison between SWCNTs functionalized with oxygen and aryl defects under identical conditions has been performed. Here, we employ a combination of spectroscopic techniques to quantify the number of defects, their distribution along the nanotubes and thus their exciton trapping efficiencies. The different slopes of Raman D/G+ ratios versus calculated defect densities from PL quantum yield measurements indicate substantial dissimilarities between oxygen and aryl defects. Supported by statistical analysis of single-nanotube PL spectra at cryogenic temperatures it reveals clustering of oxygen defects. The clustering of 2-3 oxygen defects, which act as a single exciton trap, occurs irrespective of the functionalization method and thus enables the use of simple equations to determine the density of oxygen defects and oxygen defect clusters in SWCNTs based on standard Raman spectroscopy. The presented analytical approach is a versatile and sensitive tool to study defect distribution and clustering in SWCNTs and can be applied to any new functionalization method.</description>

      <title>Vanishing conductivity-like Gilbert damping in mirror-symmetric van der Waals ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnetic materials has significantly expanded the realm of magnetic materials and enabled innovative control techniques such as gating and stacking. The dynamical behavior of magnetization is profoundly influenced by the Gilbert damping parameter, a crucial factor for enhancing the speed of magnetic switching and reducing the energy consumption of magnetic devices. Despite its importance, the understanding of Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets remains limited, impeding their technological applications. Here we present a theoretical calculation of Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals metals, focusing on Fe3GaTe2 and Fe3GeTe2 as model systems. We discover that mirror symmetry prohibits intraband contributions, resulting in disappearance of conductivity-like damping. Consequently, at low temperatures, the Gilbert damping in single-layer Fe3GaTe2 and Fe3GeTe2 is remarkably low when the magnetization is perpendicular to the atomic layer, but it increases substantially when the magnetization is reoriented into the atomic plane. Furthermore, topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute significantly to damping mediated by interband transitions and can be effectively modulated by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the distinctive characteristics of Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of low-dimensional spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects are ubiquitous in small-scale systems. They emerge from interactions between accessible and inaccessible degrees of freedom and give rise to evolution equations that are non-local in time. If the characteristic time scales of accessible and inaccessible degrees of freedom are sharply separated, locality can be restored through the standard Markov approximation. Here, we show that this approach can be rigorously extended to a well-defined weak-memory regime, where the relevant time scales can be of comparable order of magnitude. We derive explicit bounds on the error of the local approximation and a convergent perturbation scheme for its construction. Being applicable to any non-local time evolution equation that is autonomous and linear in the variables of interest, our theory provides a unifying framework for the systematic description of memory effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of micro and nanoscale systems in the weak-memory regime: A mathematical framework beyond the Markov approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visible dynamics of small-scale systems are strongly affected by unobservable degrees of freedom, which can belong either to external environments or internal subsystems and almost inevitably induce memory effects. Formally, such inaccessible degrees of freedom can be systematically eliminated from essentially any microscopic model through projection operator techniques, which result in non-local time evolution equations. This article investigates how and under what conditions locality in time can be rigorously restored beyond the standard Markov approximation, which generally requires the characteristic time scales of accessible and inaccessible degrees of freedom to be sharply separated. Specifically, we consider non-local time evolution equations that are autonomous and linear in the variables of interest. For this class of models, we prove a mathematical theorem that establishes a well-defined weak-memory regime, where faithful local approximations exists, even if the relevant time scales are of comparable order of magnitude. The generators of these local approximations, which become exact in the long-time limit, are time independent and can be determined to arbitrary accuracy through a convergent perturbation theory in the memory strength, where the Markov generator is recovered in first order. For illustration, we work out three simple, yet instructive, examples covering coarse grained Markov jump networks, semi-Markov jump processes and generalized Langevin equations.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin magnetic films on heavy metal substrates with strong spin-orbit coupling provide versatile platforms for exploring novel spin textures. So far, structurally open fcc(110) substrates remain largely terra incognita. Here, we stabilize a metastable, unreconstructed Ir(110)-$(1 \times 1)$ surface supporting two layers of Fe. Combining spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we reveal a right-handed N\'eel-type spin spiral along the [$\overline{1}10$] crystallographic direction with a period of 1.27~nm as the magnetic ground state. Our analysis reveals this spiral is of the Yoshimori type, i.e., driven by frustrated Heisenberg interactions, with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction determining its cycloidal nature and handedness.</description>

      <title>Strategies for the alignment of electronic states in quantum-dot tunnel-injection lasers and their influence on the emission dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum-dot tunnel-injection lasers, the excited charge carriers are efficiently captured from the bulk states via an injector quantum well and then transferred into the quantum dots via a tunnel barrier. The alignment of the electronic levels is crucial for the high efficiency of these processes and especially for the fast modulation dynamics of these lasers. In particular, the quantum mechanical nature of the tunneling process must be taken into account in the transition from two-dimensional quantum well states to zero-dimensional quantum dot states. This results in hybrid states, from which the scattering into the quantum-dot ground states takes place. We combine electronic state calculations of the tunnel-injection structures with many-body calculations of the scattering processes and insert this into a complete laser simulator. This allows us to study the influence of the structural design and the resulting electronic states as well as limitations due to inhomogeneous quantum-dot distributions. We find that the optimal electronic state alignment deviates from a simple picture in which the of the quantum-dot ground state energies are one LO-phonon energy below the injector quantum well ground state.</description>

      <title>Fate of surface gaps in magnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, the surface states can exhibit a gap due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Various experiments, while suggesting the existence of the surface gap, have raised questions about its underlying mechanism in the presence of different magnetic orderings. Here, we demonstrate that magnon-mediated electron-electron interactions, whose effects are not limited to the surfaces perpendicular to the magnetic ordering, can significantly influence surface states and their effective gaps. On the surfaces perpendicular to the spin quantization axis, many-body interactions can enhance the band gap to a degree that surpasses the non-interacting scenario. Then, on surfaces parallel to the magnetic ordering, we find that strong magnon-induced fermionic interactions can lead to features resembling a massless-like gap. These remarkable results largely stem from the fact that magnon-mediated interactions exhibit considerable long-range behavior compared to direct Coulomb interactions among electrons, thereby dominating the many-body properties at the surface of magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmions: from lumps to supercompactons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic Skyrmion is described by one control parameter and one length scale. We study the two extreme limits of the control parameter - infinitely large and vanishing - and find that the magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "restricted" magnetic Skyrmion and an O(3) sigma model lump, respectively. Depending on the potential under consideration, the restricted limit manifests differently. In the case of the Zeeman term, the restricted magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "supercompacton" that develops a discontinuity, whereas for the Zeeman term to the power 3/2 it becomes a normal compacton. In both the lump and the restricted limit the solution is given in exact explicit form. We observe that the case of the Zeeman term squared, which can also be understood as a special combination of the Zeeman term and the easy-plane potential - realizable in the laboratory, the analytically exact solution for all values of the coupling - including the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) case - is also of the lump type. Finally, we notice that certain materials (e.g. Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si or Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge) have a rather large control parameter $\epsilon$ of order 100, making the restricted limit a suitable rough approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phenomena in a system of three coupled microcavities. The possibility of observing polariton blockade in a dimer and triple micropillar configuration is discussed. The discovered quantum effects allow using these systems as versatile sources of individual polariton photons. Various manifestations of the quantum blockade can be tuned with the use of the pumping laser frequency. We discovered that the action of an artificial gauge field on a polariton trion causes the effect of a collective quantum blockade -- a phenomenon consisting in blocking of excitation of the state with $n$ particles distributed over multiple coupled modes. We found that when a collective quantum blockade on a non-Hermitain polariton dimer as part of the trion and a blockade on the machine itself with an antibunching effect of a micropillar coupled to the dimer, then a polariton dimer is entangled with that micropillar.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance oscillations in vertical junctions of 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) oscillations serve as a hallmark of intrinsic quantum behavior, traditionally observed only in conducting systems. Here we report the discovery of MR oscillations in an insulating system, the vertical junctions of CrPS$_4$ which is a two dimensional (2D) A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Systematic investigations of MR peaks under varying conditions, including electrode materials, magnetic field direction, temperature, voltage bias and layer number, elucidate a correlation between MR oscillations and spin-canted states in CrPS$_4$. Experimental data and analysis point out the important role of the in-gap electronic states in generating MR oscillations, and we proposed that spin selected interlayer hopping of localized defect states may be responsible for it. Our findings not only illuminate the unusual electronic transport in CrPS$_4$ but also underscore the potential of van der Waals magnets for exploring interesting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Topological vortices in planar S-TI-S Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the Josephson vortices in planar superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) junctions, where the TI section is narrow and long. We are motivated by recent experiments, especially by those in junctions of Corbino ring geometry, where non-zero critical current was observed at low temperatures even if a non-zero phase winding number (fluxoid) was enforced in the ring by the perpendicular magnetic field. In this paper we focus on the "atomic" limit in which the low-energy bound states of different vortices do not overlap. In this limit we can associate the non-vanishing critical current with the irregularities (disorder) in the junction's width. We also discuss the microwave spectroscopy of the Josephson vortices in the atomic limit and observe particularly simple selection rules for the allowed transitions.</description>

      <title>Giant Heat Flux Effect in Non-Chiral Transmission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of heat transport in non-chiral transmission lines (TLs) of quantum Hall edge channels coupled to Ohmic contacts (OCs), where heat transport is driven by charge fluctuations in the heat Coulomb blockade regime. This framework challenges conventional paradigms by revealing a giant heat flux effect-a significant amplification in heat transport arising from non-trivial fluctuation-dissipation relations. Through a Langevin-based approach, we derive the effective noise power in the chiral currents, which underlies this enhanced heat flux. Our findings predict clear experimental signatures unique to non-chiral TLs as well as providing insights into finite-frequency effects, showing crossovers to more conventional diffusive behavior. This work offers a perspective on feedback mechanisms in quasi-1D heat transport with implications for dissipation control in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Sondheimer oscillations of conductivity in thin cadmium crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.</description>

      <title>Features of the Contact Angle Hysteresis at the Nanoscale: A Molecular Dynamics Insight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of a three-phase contact line between gas, liquid, and solid is important for numerous applications. At the macroscale, the three-phase contact line response to an external force action is often characterized by a contact angle hysteresis, and several models are presented in the literature for its description. Yet, there is still a need for more information about such model applications at the nanoscale. In this study, a molecular dynamics approach was used to investigate the shape of a liquid droplet under an external force for different wetting regimes. In addition, an analytic model for describing the droplet shape was developed. It gives us the possibility to evaluate the receding and advancing wetting angle accurately. With our modeling, we found that the interplay between capillary forces and viscous forces is crucial to characterize the droplet shape at the nanoscale. In this frame, the importance of the rolling movement of the interface between liquid and vapor was pointed out. We also demonstrate that in the range of the external forces when capillary forces are most significant compared to others, hysteresis is well described by the macroscale Cox-Voinov model.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices with randomly connected boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices, formed by tessellating the hyperbolic plane with regular polygons, exhibit a diverse range of exotic physical phenomena beyond conventional Euclidean lattices. Here, we investigate the impact of disorder on hyperbolic lattices and reveal that the Anderson localization occurs at strong disorder strength, accompanied by the presence of mobility edges. Taking the hyperbolic $\{p,q\}=\{3,8\}$ and $\{p,q\}=\{4,8\}$ lattices as examples, we employ finite-size scaling of both spectral statistics and the inverse participation ratio to pinpoint the transition point and critical exponents. Our findings indicate that the transition points tend to increase with larger values of $\{p,q\}$ or curvature. In the limiting case of $\{\infty, q\}$, we further determine its Anderson transition using the cavity method, drawing parallels with the random regular graph. Our work lays the cornerstone for a comprehensive understanding of Anderson transition and mobility edges on hyperbolic lattices.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Fermionic transport through a driven quantum point contact: breakdown of Floquet thermalization beyond a critical driving frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum system that consists of two fermionic chains coupled by a driven quantum point contact (QPC). The QPC contains a bond with a periodically varying tunneling amplitude. Initially the left chain is packed with fermions while the right one is empty. We numerically track the evolution of the system and demonstrate that, at frequencies above a critical one, the current through the QPC halts, and the particle imbalance between the chains remains forever. This implies a spectacular breakdown of the Floquet version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which predicts a homogeneous particle density profile at large times. We confirm the effect for various driving protocols and interparticle interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>
