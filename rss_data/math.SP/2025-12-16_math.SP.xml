      <title>The generic canonical form for $^\star$congruence of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we prove that the set of $n\times n$ complex matrices is the closure of a certain open subset whose elements have a very specific canonical form under congruence, which is uniquely determined up to the values of some parameters, but which has a slightly different expression depending on whether $n$ is even or odd. As a consequence, the canonical form under congruence of the elements of this subset can be considered the generic canonical form under congruence of complex $n\times n$ matrices. Second, we prove that the set of $n\times n$ complex matrices is the union of the closures of certain $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ open subsets and that, for each of these subsets, its elements have a very specific canonical form under $^*$congruence, which is uniquely determined up to the values of some parameters. As a consequence, the $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ canonical forms under $^*$congruence of the elements of each of these subsets can be considered the generic canonical forms under $^*$congruence of complex $n\times n$ matrices. So, there is only one generic canonical form under congruence whereas the number of generic canonical forms under $^*$congruence is $\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$ instead, which reveals a strong dichotomy between the relations of congruence and $^*$congruence with respect to generic structures. In other words, we determine in this paper the generic matrix representations of $n\times n$ bilinear and sesquilinear forms in $\mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb{C}^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the Laplacian on two models of random hyperbolic 3-orbifolds, related to the Apollonian group and the super Apollonian group. We determine explicit spectral gaps for these random orbifolds. Moreover, we use our model to investigate the bass note spectrum of the set of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Graining via Lumping: Exact Calculations and Fundamental Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting broken time-reversibility at micro- and nanoscale is often difficult when experiments offer limited state resolution. We introduce a lumping method that builds an effective semi-Markov model able to reproduce exactly the full entropy-production statistics of the microscopic dynamics. The mean entropy production stays accurate even when hidden current-carrying cycles are merged, though higher-order information can be unavoidably lost. In these cases, we capture violations of fluctuation theorems consistent with experiments, opening a path to novel inference strategies out of equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: The density of states of a self-adjoint operator generalizes the eigenvalue distribution of a Hermitian matrix. We prove convergence of the density of states for a tight-binding model with a slowly-varying periodic potential to the density of states of its continuum approximation, a Mathieu-type equation.</description>

      <title>Directional Spectral Analysis: Dimension Reduction for Periodic Elliptic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the limiting absorption principle for elliptic equations with periodic structures is very challenging when the dimension is greater than 1. The fundamental reason for the dimensional barrier is the mismatch between directional physical reality and the direction-independent classic spectral analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new approach which introduce the direction into classic spectral analysis. With the new approach, the solution obtained by the limiting absorption principle can be formulated in a semi-analytic form, which not only gives an explicit representation of the solutions, but also reflects the phenomenon in physics.
  The new approach resolves the mismatch between mathematics and physics, and also breaks the dimensional barriers. It also opens a door to a lot of further possibilities, ranging from the analysis of solutions and numerical simulations for the solutions.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of the magnetic Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirac operator describes the relativistic motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field. Although this operator got a lot of attention in physics many of its fundamental mathematical properties remain unexplored and this article is a first step towards filling this gap. To this end we provide a number of eigenvalue estimates for the magnetic Dirac operator on closed Riemannian manifolds and explicitly compute its spectrum for specific choices of the magnetic field on the flat torus and on the three-dimensional round sphere.</description>

      <title>On quasi-isospectrality of potentials and Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quasi-isospectral operators as a generalization of isospectral operators. The paper contains both expository material and original results. We begin by reviewing known results on isospectral potentials on compact manifolds and finite intervals, and then introduce the notion of quasi-isospectrality. We next investigate the BMT method as a systematic approach to constructing quasi-isospectral Sturm-Liouville operators on a finite interval, and apply it to several boundary value problems. Our main result shows that any two quasi-isospectral closed manifolds of odd dimension are, in fact, isospectral. In addition, we extend classical compactness results for isospectral potentials on low-dimensional manifolds to the quasi-isospectral setting via heat trace asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the perturbed Landau-Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Dirac operator with constant magnetic field in $\mathbb R^2$. Its spectrum consists of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities, known as the Landau-Dirac levels. Under compactly supported perturbations, we study the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues near each Landau-Dirac level. Similarly to the Landau (Schr\"odinger) operator, we demonstrate that a three-terms asymptotic formula holds for the eigenvalue counting function. One of the main novelties of this work is the treatment of some perturbations of variable sign. In this context we explore some remarkable phenomena related to the finiteness or infiniteness of the discrete eigenvalues, which depend on the interplay of the different terms in the matrix perturbation.</description>

      <title>On an infinitesimal Polyakov formula for genus zero polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a genus zero compact polyhedral surface (the Riemann sphere equipped with a flat conical metric $m$). We derive the variational formulas for the determinant of the Laplacian, ${\rm det}\,\Delta^m$, on $X$ under infinitesimal variations of the positions of the conical points and the conical angles (i. e. infinitesimal variations of $X$ in the class of polyhedra with the same number of vertices). Besides having an independent interest, this derivation may serve as a somewhat belated mathematical counterpart of the well-known heuristic calculation of ${\rm det}\,\Delta^m$ performed by Aurell and Salomonson in the 90-s.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <title>Solvability Complexity Index Classification For Koopman Operator Spectra In $L^p$ For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computation of the approximate point spectrum and the approximate point $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum of bounded Koopman operators acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X}, d_{\mathcal{X}})$ with finite Borel measure $\omega$. Building on finite sections in a computable unconditional Schauder basis of $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$, we design residual tests that use only finitely many evaluations of the underlying map and produce compact sets on a planar grid, that converge in the Hausdorff metric to the target spectral sets, without spectral pollution. From these constructions we obtain a complete classification, in the sense of the Solvability Complexity Index. Also we analyze the sufficiency and existence of a Wold-von Neumann decomposition analog, that was used in the special $L^2$-case.
  The main difficulty in extending from the already analyzed Hilbert setting $(p=2)$ to general $L^p$ is the loss of orthogonality and Hilbertian structure: there is no orthonormal basis with orthogonal coordinate projections in general, the canonical truncations $E_n$ in a computable Schauder dictionary need not be contractive (and may oscillate) and the Wold-von Neumann reduction has no directly computable analog in $L^p$. We overcome these obstacles by working with computable unconditional dictionaries adapted to dyadic/Lipschitz filtrations and proving stability of residual tests under non-orthogonal truncations.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resonances, Critical Couplings, and Eigenvalue Bounds for Two-Particle Operators on $\mathbb{Z}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of lattice Schr\"odinger operators $H_{\mu_1\mu_2}(K)$ describing two identical bosons on the three-dimensional cubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^3$, where $K \in \mathbb{T}^3$ is the quasi-momentum, and $\mu_1, \mu_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ are coupling constants corresponding to on-site and nearest-neighbour interactions, respectively.
  We show that the Hilbert space $L^{2,\mathrm{e}}(\mathbb{T}^3)$ decomposes into three mutually orthogonal subspaces, each invariant under $H_{\mu_1\mu_2}(0)$. A detailed spectral analysis of the restriction of $H_{\mu_1\mu_2}(0)$ to one of these subspaces reveals two smooth critical curves in the $(\mu_1, \mu_2)$-plane, separating regions where the number of eigenvalues below the essential spectrum remains constant. For the restrictions to the other two subspaces, we identify a critical point on the $\mu_2$-axis that partitions it into intervals with a constant number of eigenvalues below the essential spectrum.
  Analogously, two additional critical curves and one critical point determine regions and intervals where the number of eigenvalues above the essential spectrum is constant. In particular, for suitable parameter values, $H_{\mu_1\mu_2}(0)$ may possess up to three bound states located either below or above the essential spectrum, with numbers $(\alpha,\beta)$ satisfying $\alpha + \beta &lt; 3$ or $(\alpha,\beta) \in \{(3,0),(0,3)\}$.
  Here, by \emph{eigenvalue bounds} we mean both the possible locations of eigenvalues outside the essential spectrum and the maximum number of such eigenvalues for given coupling parameters. Finally, we extend the analysis to arbitrary quasi-momentum $K \in \mathbb{T}^3$, obtaining general lower bounds for the number of eigenvalues of $H_{\mu_1\mu_2}(K)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the existence of the integrated density of states (IDS) of the magnetic Schr\"{o}dinger operator with a random potential on the Hilbert space \( L^2(\mathbb{R}^d) \), as an analogue of the law of large numbers (LLN) for trace functionals. In this work, we establish an analogue of the central limit theorem (CLT), which describes the fluctuations of the trace functionals of the IDS, for a class of test functions denoted by \( C^1_{d,0}(\mathbb{R}) \). This class consists of real-valued, continuously differentiable functions on \( \mathbb{R} \) that decay at the rate \( O(|x|^{-m}) \) as \( |x| \to \infty \), where \( m &gt; d + 1 \).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

Abstract: We provide a precise description of the bottom of the spectrum in the semiclassical limit of a harmonic-type Schr{\"o}dinger operator with an inverse square potential. By exploiting the connection between the eigenfunctions of these operators and the Kummer and Whittaker functions, we derive accurate localization results for the non-asymptotic zeros of these functions with respect to their first parameter, uniformly with respect to the argument taken large and real. Moreover, our operators are linked to the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with a constant magnetic field, so that our results describe its spectrum. Our spectral analysis relies on a WKB-type approach.</description>
