      <title>The Impact of Degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency on Extended Sources in ACS/WFC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using repeat imaging of a galaxy cluster taken over a seventeen-year baseline, we examine the impact that degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) has on photometric measurements of extended sources using the ACS/WFC on HST. We examine how measured brightnesses depend on time since ACS installation, source location on the WFC detectors, source brightness, and local background level in individual exposures. We find that global brightness measurements using large apertures are generally reliable within $\sim$0.05 magnitudes across the WFC detectors if exposure backgrounds are above $20e^-/{pixel}$ and sources are brighter than $\sim300e^-$ in a single exposure. However, brightness measurements on smaller scales can suffer deficiencies in excess of 0.1 mags (sometimes, significantly more) in recent data unless sources are very close to the CCD serial registers ($\lesssim 512$ pixels), or brighter than $\sim3000\,e^-$ in a single exposure. We also show how degraded CTE can result in artificial asymmetries in galaxy light distributions, which are largely mitigated if backgrounds are $&gt;20e^-/{pixel}$ and targets are not far ($&gt;1536$ pixels) from the serial registers. As expected, brightness measurements in later epoch data are best when using CTE-corrected images (FLC/DRC), but our results imply that the pixel-based CTE correction algorithm employed by the ACS reduction pipeline does not necessarily place charge back into its original location within extended sources. Based on this study, users are advised to keep backgrounds above the already recommended $30e^-/\mathrm{pixel}$, ensure targets will have at least $\sim 300e^-$ in a single exposure, and place targets close to the serial registers if analysis of their spatially resolved properties is needed.</description>

      <title>Variational views for self-supervised learning in radio astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys are producing progressively larger and more complex datasets, making traditional supervised approaches that rely on extensive labelled catalogues increasingly difficult. Consequently, pre-training using self-supervised learning (SSL), which offers a scalable route by extracting structure directly from unlabelled images, is becoming attractive for many downstream applications. In this work we consider the use of coupled self-supervised representation learning approaches for radio galaxy morphology pre-training. In order to account for the more nuanced variations in radio galaxy morphology than are typically included in the augmented views of view-based SSL algorithms, we use a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate views for training a larger view-based self-supervised model. To do this, a $\beta$-VAE was trained on the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset, where moderate regularization ($\beta = 2.3$) was found to provide a good balance between reconstruction quality and disentanglement of generative factors such as source multiplicity and lobe asymmetry. An analysis of the $\beta$-VAE reveals that Fanaroff-Riley class identity manifests as a continuous transition across the latent space, rather than being associated to a single discrete dimension. $\beta$-VAE reconstructions were then incorporated as generative augmentations within a view-based SSL pipeline. Our experiments show that combining these generative views with standard image augmentations improves downstream classification performance, and we present ablation studies clarifying the relative contribution of each augmentation type. These results indicate that generative and contrastive approaches are complementary, and point toward disentanglement-aware self-supervised learning as a promising direction for future radio astronomy surveys.</description>

      <title>The ngVLA Band-4 Water Vapor Radiometry Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ngVLA has adopted a standalone system with a $\sim$~1.5 m diameter antenna and associated ambient temperature receiver and electronics at each antenna as its baseline design for water vapor radiometer (WVR). The WVR is intended to decrease calibration overheads for tropospheric phase correction for the high frequency bands (5 \&amp; 6; 30.5-116 GHz) to levels lower than feasible with fast switched reference gain calibration.
  In this memo, we present an alternative concept utilizing the standard Band-4 science receivers and the main antennas. This would require the Band-4 feed to be placed between those of Bands 5 \&amp; 6 resulting in a beam offset of 0.8 deg, similar to the beam size of the standalone 1.5 m antenna. The main benefits of the Band-4 WVR concept are: (1) sensing water vapor in a region more representative of the Band 5 \&amp; 6 science beams in the lower layers of the troposphere, in the near-field of the 18 m antenna, than the 1.5 m antenna (2) significantly relaxing the stability requirements due to the lower receiver temperature of the standard Band-4 cryogenic receiver and (3) eliminating the procurement, deployment, and maintenance of a large number of standalone units. Given these advantages, it is recommended that the details and the pros and cons of Band-4 WVR implementation compared a standalone system be carefully considered.</description>

      <title>Astrometric properties of reference frame sources as a function of redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies based on the latest realisation of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) have suggested a correlation between astrometric properties (such as the radio-optical offset) and redshift for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We extend these investigations by using a large, all-sky sample of approximately 22,000 compact radio sources from the Radio Fundamental catalogue (RFC) to examine this relationship in a systematic and statistically robust manner. We compiled redshifts for about 10,000 RFC sources over the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 5 by combining data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17/19 with additional datasets from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database. Cross-matching with Gaia Data Release 3 yielded a clean sample of 4,068 RFC objects with reliable spectroscopic redshifts and classifications (galaxies and quasi-stellar objects; QSOs). We analysed the redshift dependence of their radio astrometric properties from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and their optical astrometric properties from Gaia. We find that the VLBI astrometric properties show no significant dependence on redshift within the achieved level of precision. In contrast, several optical astrometric quantities exhibit clear redshift-dependent behaviour. The median absolute radio-optical offsets decrease markedly over 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.5, where galaxies dominate the sample, decline more gradually over 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3, and exhibit a mild increase at z &gt; 1.3, where QSOs dominate. Similar behaviour is observed for several Gaia astrometric quantities, including astrometric uncertainties, proper motions, and G magnitudes. These behaviours can be largely explained by the dependence of Gaia astrometric performance on G magnitude and by the evolution of the G magnitude with redshift.</description>

      <title>Safety Acquisitions: Redundancy for non-repeatable multi-orbit STIS visits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For observations of supernovae, kilonovae, tidal disruption events, and other non-repeatable observations, it is important the science data is taken successfully within a specific time window. Part of obtaining that data is often centering objects in the aperture to a higher accuracy than is available from Hubble Space Telescope's (HST's) blind pointing. On HST STIS the sequence of exposures responsible for this centering is the target acquisition or STIS ACQ sequence, and it is most often placed only at the beginning of a visit. Unfortunately, STIS ACQ sequences will fail if the observatory experiences issues locating guide stars in time for the start of the required exposures. If the guide stars are located at a later point in the visit, the remaining science exposures can be taken but the pointing might not be as accurate as is required. This work discusses both the frequency of this issue and the feasibility of placing redundant or "safety" STIS ACQ sequences in a multi-orbit visit to regain the desired pointing accuracy in an affected visit. To do so we select a subset of all 113 STIS ACQ sequences from September 2018 to September 2023 which have experienced this issue. We find that this problem occurs in ~5% of the total STIS ACQ sequences taken during that time period, with a recent increase in the rate to ~9% from March to September 2023. Since the observatory goes through periods of better or worse pointing performance, this recent increased failure rate is not guaranteed to continue. For those failed visits which span multiple orbits, ~39% never obtain a lock on the guide stars and thus take no data. Of the multi-orbit visits that do recover the guide stars, the majority (~78%) do so before the beginning of science exposures in the second orbit. We also provide advice for users on how to make a risk assessment based on the analysis presented here.</description>

      <title>Photometry of Fireballs using High Frame Rate Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast sampling photometry is essential for characterising fireballs and their fragmentation episodes which link to the meteoroid internal structure. Accurate measurements remain challenging due to the large required dynamic range of up to 10 stellar magnitudes driving up operational complexity and cost. We developed an all-sky camera system operating at up to 500 frames per second featuring a novel Detection Localised Auto-brightness Control. Custom software manages high data throughput via transient detection and region-of-interest saving with real-time photometry. Two field deployments validate photometric accuracy against conventional 30 frames per second cameras and demonstrate the successful capture of a bright magnitude -15 fireball with minimal saturation. The system achieves an effective dynamic range between apparent magnitudes -3 and -17 capturing minimally saturated light curves for most fireballs. A successful semi-empirical fragmentation analysis verifies its ability to provide data for detailed physical modelling. The primary application for this validated system will be as a core component of the Global Fireball Observatory's next-generation instrumentation. The intention is to deploy it in a hybrid observatory, operating alongside a dedicated high-resolution astrometric camera. This configuration will allow the network to simultaneously capture precise trajectory data for orbit and fall-line calculations and acquire complete, unsaturated high dynamic range light curves at high temporal resolution for detailed physical analysis, combining the strengths of both systems.</description>

      <title>Direct comparison of SiPMs and PMTs in operation with a bright background and prospects of using SPADs as truly digital sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) alongside conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) is a remarkable technological development in modern ground-based very high energy gamma-ray astronomy. SiPMs exhibit comparable or even higher photon detection efficiencies (PDEs) than PMTs. The sensitivity of a PMT matches well the spectral shape of Cherenkov radiation from extended air showers. In contrast to a PMT, the sensitivity of a SiPM is shifted toward longer wavelengths, where the intensity of light of night sky (LoNS), considered as unwanted noise, increases significantly. It is obvious that a SiPM with a higher PDE will indeed measure more Cherenkov light than a PMT, but it will also detect significantly higher LoNS noise; the question is which factor will predominate in the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). To compare the performance of a PMT with that of a SiPM, we built SiPM-based modules and installed these and operated in parallel in the imaging camera of the 17 m diameter MAGIC telescope. Our long-term studies show that SiPM, despite their higher PDE, can deliver only a comparable to PMT performance. As already the name SiPM suggests, we use these semiconductor sensors analogously to classical PMTs: We amplify their small signals, digitize, and calibrate the converted amplitudes. Although SiPM is essentially a digital sensor, its common-anode design does not allow one to directly profit from it. Numerous arrays of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are being developed in various laboratories worldwide. Unlike SiPM, SPAD arrays digitize the incident photons from the outset and count their number. We will dwell on the potential further developments of SPADs.</description>

      <title>Multivariate time-series forecasting of ASTRI-Horn monitoring data: A Normal Behavior Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a Normal Behavior Model (NBM) developed to forecast monitoring time-series data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope under normal operating conditions. The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical modeling of liposome congregation in meteorite craters of Early Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.</description>

      <title>Inferring the population properties of galactic binaries from LISA's stochastic foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic binaries are expected to be the most numerous LISA sources and to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave foreground whose spectral shape encodes information about the underlying population. Extracting this information with standard hierarchical methods is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the problem and the computational cost of global-fit analyses. We present a simulation-based inference framework to measure the population properties of galactic binaries directly from the reconstructed foreground. Adopting an astrophysically agnostic parametrization in the observable space -- defined by signal amplitude, frequency, and frequency derivative -- we generate synthetic catalogs and foreground spectra using a global-fit-inspired subtraction algorithm. We then train a neural posterior estimator to map spectra to population parameters. We validate our method on simulated data and recover population parameters with good accuracy, including the total number of binaries. As a by-product, we present a GPU-accelerated version of the subtraction algorithm, which delivers a ~100X speed-up compared to previous implementations in the literature. Our results demonstrate that LISA's stochastic foreground alone carries significant information about the Galactic binary population and provide a practical step toward joint inference from resolved and unresolved sources.</description>

      <title>Variable Red Giants Exploration with MASTER Robotic Net: Main Algorithms and Study of Three Mira-type Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are discussing the capabilities of MASTER network of robotic telescopes to study variable red giant stars. We report the discovery and present archival light curves for three optical transients, connected with long period variable red giants, based on MASTER Robotic Net all-sky survey observations and archival MASTER light curves at Lomonosov database storage. We demonstrate transient detection frames and light curves for three Mira-type variables: MASTER OT $J083717.54-573411.1$, MASTER OT $J190436.33+192828.7$ and MASTER OT $J07010810-6818548$. Spectroscopically validated carbon star MASTER OT $J07010810-6818548$ shows mean magnitude growth but constant pulsation period which may indicate the presence of a long secondary period. As the result of MASTER wide-field images analysis at Lomonosov supercomputer data storage we present the 8-years historical light curves for all three objects with period calculations for all three Mira-type variables. We estimated fundamental astrophysical parameters for all three Mira-type variables: luminosities, radii, and zero age main sequence (ZAMS) masses.</description>

      <title>Tempawral: A Time-Resolved Retrieval Framework for Variable Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs and exoplanets are thought to host complex atmospheric phenomena such as clouds, storms, and chemical heterogeneity, akin to weather patterns on Earth. These features can produce pronounced spectral variability. Time-variability monitoring provides a unique window into surface inhomogeneities that cannot be directly resolved with foreseeable imaging technology. Current time-series analysis techniques have provided qualitative constraints on variability mechanisms but lack the ability to quantitatively estimate the extent of variation on atmospheric properties. We present Tempawral, the first data-driven time-resolved atmospheric retrieval framework that quantitatively retrieving variability in atmospheric parameters via an eigen-spectra inversion technique, leveraging the full spectra dataset. We validate this method on simulated time-series spectra of a variable brown dwarf, demonstrating that it successfully recovers key variability drivers, including inhomogeneous cloud coverage, evolving chemical abundances, and changes in temperature structure. We further showcase the utility of Tempawral by applying it to JWST/NIRISS-SOSS time-series observations of a highly variable T2.5 brown dwarf. The observed variability is best explained by a $\sim$300 K temperature perturbation near the 1-bar, accompanied by variations in the abundances of $\rm H_{2}O$, $\rm CO$, $\rm FeH$, as well as changes in the thickness of the iron cloud deck. This work provides a generalized framework for time-resolved atmospheric retrievals in the JWST era, enabling comprehensive interpretations of dynamic atmospheric processes in substellar objects.</description>

      <title>Improving calibration accuracy with torque coupled gravity field calibrator for sub-Hz gravitational wave observation in CHRONOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in low-frequency gravitational-wave detectors is the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of calibration lines, particularly in torsion-bar systems where the response is governed by rotational dynamics. In this work, we resolve this issue by optimizing the geometrical configuration of a torque-coupled gravity field calibrator (GCal), achieving an improvement in calibration-line SNR by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional layouts.
  For the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed-meter (CHRONOS), the calibration signal appears as a monochromatic line within the $0.1$--$10~\mathrm{Hz}$ band. At $1~\mathrm{Hz}$, the strain-equivalent calibration amplitude reaches $|h_{\rm GCal}| = 1.18 \times 10^{-14}$, corresponding to an SNR density of $|h_{\rm GCal}|/S_h = 4.25 \times 10^{3}$. This demonstrates for the first time that a high-SNR calibration line can be directly injected into the sub-Hz band of a torsion-bar detector.
  A first-order perturbative error propagation analysis yields a total fractional systematic uncertainty of $\delta h_{\rm GCal}/h_{\rm GCal} = 0.24\%$, dominated by geometric alignment uncertainties, while contributions from mass uncertainties and the gravitational constant remain subdominant. The corresponding absolute systematic uncertainty is $\delta h_{\rm GCal} \sim 10^{-17}$ at $1~\mathrm{Hz}$.
  These results establish torque-coupled gravitational calibration as a practical solution to the longstanding low-SNR problem in sub-Hz torsion-bar detectors and provide a robust pathway toward precision absolute calibration in the low-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Exo Skryer: A JAX-accelerated sub-stellar atmospheric retrieval framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheric research relies heavily on retrieval frameworks to recover thermal and chemical properties and perform model comparison in an observational data-driven approach. However, the computational effort required for retrieval modelling has rapidly increased, driven by JWST data that covers large spectral intervals at moderate spectral resolutions, and ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy. To help tackle the computational burden faced by contemporary retrieval requirements, I present a new sub-stellar atmosphere retrieval modelling framework, Exo Skryer, that utilises the JAX library for Python to enable scalable, computationally efficient forward modelling as well as posterior sampling. I present example retrievals for pre- and current JWST era observations for both transmission and emission spectra, finding consistent results to previous retrieval modelling efforts, apart from a WASP-107b test case. In addition, I present a new method to directly retrieve the real and imaginary optical constants (n, k) of suspected aerosol infrared absorption features. Due to its computational expediency, Exo Skryer will be highly suited for future demanding retrieval efforts that incorporate more spatial dimensionality, complex forward models and high-dimensional parameter sets.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Method for Air-Shower Reconstruction using Information Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio detection of extensive air showers provides a powerful method for studying the origin of high-energy cosmic rays. The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) offers unprecedentedly detailed measurements of the radio emission footprint. However, fully exploiting this information requires advanced reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for air shower reconstruction based on Bayesian inference and Information Field Theory (IFT). Our method is built on a fully differentiable forward model of the radio signal, which incorporates a physical emission parameterization and a precise wavefront model. Additionally, we augment this physical model with Gaussian processes to account for systematic uncertainties in both the signal fluence and arrival timing. By leveraging gradient information, our approach enables efficient (three orders of magnitude acceleration w.r.t.\ the legacy method) and robust inference of the underlying physical shower parameters, such as primary energy and the depth of shower maximum, $X_\text{max}$. This work provides not only point estimates but also a rigorous quantification of uncertainties. We achieve a resolution in $X_\text{max}$ of $25\,\mathrm{g/cm^2}$ and a radiation energy resolution of $12\%$ on simulations for LOFAR.</description>

      <title>GPU-Native Compressed Neighbor Lists with a Space-Filling-Curve Data Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a compressed neighbor list for short-range particle-particle interaction based on a space- filling curve (SFC) memory layout and particle clusters. The neighbor list can be constructed efficiently on GPUs, supporting NVIDIA and AMD hardware, and has a memory footprint of only 4 bytes per particle to store approximately 200 neighbors. Compared to the highly-optimized domain-specific neighbor list implementation of GROMACS, a molecular dynamics code, it has a comparable cluster overhead and delivers similar performance in a neighborhood pass. Thanks to the SFC-based data layout and the support for varying interaction radii per particle, our neighbor list performs well for systems with high density contrasts, such as those encountered in many astrophysical and cosmological applications. Due to the close relation between SFCs and octrees, our neighbor list seamlessly integrates with octree-based domain decomposition and multipole-based methods for long-range gravitational or electrostatic interactions. To demonstrate the coupling between long- and short-range forces, we simulate an Evrard collapse, a standard test case for the coupling between hydrodynamical and gravitational forces, on up to 1024 GPUs, and compare our results to the analytical solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HelioSpectrotron~5000 (HS5000) is an interactive, multi-resolution solar spectral atlas designed to facilitate direct comparison between high-resolution reference spectra and observations obtained with a wide range of ground-based instruments. Based on the Hamburg FTS atlas, the HS5000 provides both absolute intensity and continuum-normalized spectra at arbitrary spectral ranges and resolutions, as well as curated line identifications and optional telluric contamination. This framework enables rapid wavelength calibration, line identification, and context image generation.</description>

      <title>Development of a Cherenkov-Based Time-of-Flight Detector Using Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to develop high precision Time-of-Flight (TOF) devices based on high refractive index solid Cherenkov radiators read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Cherenkov light is prompt and therefore ideal for reaching the intrinsic timing limits of TOF systems. By utilizing a thin, high-refractive-index radiator a nearly instantaneous signal is generated by particles exceeding the Cherenkov threshold. In order to achieve the ultimate time resolution, we carried out a rigorous optimization of the radiator material and geometry, alongside the efficiency of the optical coupling to the SiPM sensors. The key factors limiting the time resolution were characterized by comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, subsequently validated against experimental beam test data. We assembled small-scale prototypes instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM arrays sensors with pitches ranging from 1.3 to 3 mm coupled with various window materials, such as fused silica and MgF2, featuring various thickness values. The prototypes were successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN-PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on either the Petiroc 2A or the Radioroc 2 interfaced to a picoTDC to measure charges and times. By comparing the time measurements with two SiPM arrays we were able to measure a time resolution better than 33.2 ps at the full system level with a charged particle detection efficiency of 100%. Our results demonstrate the expected performance benchmarks for the charged particle detection efficiency and time resolution and highlight the potential of the developed Cherenkov-based TOF detectors for next-generation particle identification systems.</description>

      <title>From particles to precision. Simulating subsonic turbulence with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has traditionally been hampered by zeroth-order (E0) errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive numerical dissipation. We demonstrate that the recently developed SPH-EXA code can overcome these challenges, producing results similar to those of other state-of-the-art non-SPH codes, such as AREPO and GIZMO. We show that SPH-EXA accurately reproduces the Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in the subsonic regime with increasing resolution, closely matching state-of-the-art non-SPH methods. This is an outstanding result given the important role of SPH codes in astrophysics and cosmology, and the ubiquity of turbulent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Skykatana: a scalable framework to construct sky masks for the Vera Rubin Observatory and large astronomical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern wide-field surveys require robust spatial masks to excise bright-star halos, bleed trails, poor-quality regions, and user-defined geometry at scale. We present Skykatana, an open source pipeline that builds and combines boolean HEALPix/HEALSparse maps into science-ready masks and engineered for low-memory operation. Skykatana can efficiently construct, visualize multi-order coverage maps and generate random points in high-resolution masks over half of the celestial sphere with very limited resources and leveraging the hierarchical partition of data the HATS/LSDB framework. We demonstrate two end-to-end applications: (1) a Subaru HSC-WISE composite mask; and (2) Rubin star masks generated on demand in the Rubin Science Platform by querying HATS/LSDB Gaia data and assigning radii from empirical fits to Rubin DP1 data. We release full bright-star masks for various regions of the Rubin footprint and describe performance and scaling. The code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at https://github.com/samotracio/skykatana, and the LSST masks can be obtained from https://osf.io/r5vw6</description>

      <title>The Numerics of VMEC++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the Vela pulsar's rotational behaviour using approximately 100 months of observational data spanning from September 2016 to January 2025, during which four glitches were identified. Here, we demonstrate the post-glitch recovery of these glitches within the framework of the vortex creep model. We further present the investigation of vortex residuals (the discrepancy between observed values and those predicted by the vortex creep model) by interpreting them in the context of the vortex bending model. In addition, we report a positive correlation between the glitch magnitude and the time to the next glitch, applicable only for the large glitch events observed in the Vela pulsar. Furthermore, we estimate the braking index of the Vela pulsar to be 2.94 $\pm$ 0.55.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Disks With Self-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can a disk orbiting a central body be eccentric, when the disk feels its own self-gravity and is pressureless? Contradictory answers appear in the literature. We show that such a disk can be eccentric, but only if it has a sharply truncated edge: the surface density $\Sigma$ must vanish at the edge, and the $\Sigma$ profile must be sufficiently steep at the point where it vanishes. If either requirement is violated, an eccentric disturbance leaks out of the bulk of the disk into the low density edge region, and cannot return. An edge where $\Sigma$ asymptotes to zero but never vanishes, as is often assumed for astrophysical disks, is insufficiently sharp. Similar results were shown by Hunter &amp; Toomre (1969) for galactic warps. We demonstrate these results in three ways: by solving the eigenvalue equation for the eccentricity profile; by solving the initial value problem; and by analyzing a new and simple dispersion relation that is valid for any wavenumber, unlike WKB. As a byproduct, we show that softening the self-gravitational potential is not needed to model a flat disk, and we develop a softening-free algorithm to model the disk's Laplace-Lagrange-like equations. The algorithm is easy to implement and is more accurate than softening-based methods at a given resolution by many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Characterization of an MPPC-Based Scintillator Telescope and Measurement of Cosmic Muon Angular Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents the design, characterization, and application of a high-sensitivity optical detection system based on plastic scintillators coupled to Multi-Pixel Photon Counters (MPPCs). The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\bm{\cos^n(\theta)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\bm{n = 1.44 \pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the MPPC-scintillator coupling for precise photon counting and timing applications in high-energy physics instrumentation.</description>
