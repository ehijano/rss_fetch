      <title>Properties for ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate properties of ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions. First, we discuss the the coefficient estimates for ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions. In particular, we obtain Heinz's inequality for ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions, propose a coefficient bound for normalized univalent ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions and prove that this holds for the subclass that consists of starlike functions. Furthermore, by utilizing the relationship between ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions and harmonic functions, we obtain Rad\'{o}'s theorem, Koebe type covering theorems and area theorem. Finally, we show growth estimates and distortion estimates for ($\alpha,\beta$)-harmonic functions by using the $L^p$ norms of the boundary functions.</description>

      <title>Bohr-Rogosinski Inequalities for bounded analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze refined and improved versions of the classical Bohr inequality for the function class $\mathcal{B}$, which consists of analytic self- mappings defined on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$. We improve the Bohr-Rogosinski inequality for the class $\mathcal{B}$ of analytic self-maps by incorporating the area measure of sub-disks $\mathbb{D}_r$ in $\mathbb{D}$.</description>

      <title>On Weinstein domains in symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Weinstein domain symplectically embedded in a closed symplectic manifold always admits symplectic hypersurfaces in its complement, possibly after a deformation. As a consequence, we obtain an obstruction for a closed 3-dimensional manifold to arise as the boundary of a Weinstein domain in a class of symplectic 4-manifolds that includes many symplectic rational surfaces. A particular application is that no Brieskorn homology sphere bounds a Weinstein domain symplectically embedded in a rational surface diffeomorphic to $S^2\times S^2$ or to ${\mathbb C} P^2\# k \overline{{\mathbb C}P}^2$, for any $k\leq 7$, despite the fact that many Brieskorn spheres bound Stein domains holomorphically embedded in these rational surfaces. Several families of Brieskorn spheres are obtained that do not bound a Weinstein domain in any 4-manifold with a ``positive'' symplectic structure. Such Weinstein domains do exist in certain positive symplectic rational surfaces when $k\geq 8$, though their topology is significantly constrained.</description>

      <title>Characterization of multipliers on vector-valued Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work characterizes the multipliers on vector-valued Hardy spaces over the infinite polydisk and the infinite polytorus, as well as in the context of Dirichlet series. Unlike the scalar-valued setting, where these frameworks are completely analogous reformulations of one another, there are significant differences in the vector-valued context. We prove that while the space of multipliers on the infinite polydisk is $H_\infty(\mathbb{D}^\infty_2, B(X))$, the situation on the infinite polytorus is distinct; assuming $X$ is separable, the multiplier space can be identified as $H_\infty^{sot}(\mathbb{T}^\infty, B(X))$, consisting of essentially bounded SOT-measurable functions. These spaces coincide when $X$ possesses the analytic Radon-Nikodym property. Finally, we extend these results to the associated Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series, $\mathcal{H}_p^+(X)$ and $\mathcal{H}_p(X)$, providing characterizations for their respective multiplier spaces.</description>

      <title>Infinity of solutions to initial-boundary value problems for linear constant-coefficient evolution PDEs on semi-infinite intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short communication, we announce an algorithmic procedure for constructing non-uniqueness counter-examples of classical solutions to initial-boundary-value problems for a wide class of linear evolution partial differential equations, of any order and with constant coefficients, formulated in a quarter-plane. Our approach relies on analysis of regularity and asymptotic properties, near the boundary of the spatio-temporal domain, of closed-form integral-representation formulae derived via complex-analytic techniques and rigorous implementation of the modern PDE technique known as Fokas unified transform method. In order to elucidate the novel idea and demonstrate the proposed technique in a self-contained fashion, we explicitly present its application to two concrete examples, namely the heat equation and the linear KdV equation with Dirichlet data. New uniqueness theorems for these two models are also presented herein.</description>

      <title>Octonionic Para-linear Self-Adjoint Operators and Spectral Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a groundbreaking advancement in the theory of operators defined on octonionic Hilbert spaces, successfully resolving a fundamental challenge that has persisted for over six decades. Due to the intrinsic non-associative nature of octonions, conventional linear operator theory encounters profound structural difficulties. We make use of an original conceptual framework termed para-linearity, an innovative generalization of linearity that naturally accommodates the octonionic algebraic structure. Within this newly established paradigm, we systematically develop an appropriate algebraic setting by defining a carefully designed operator algebra and an adjoint operation which, together, recapture essential analytic properties previously inaccessible in this context. We identify a geometric structure, the slice cone, as the fundamental object encoding spectral properties typically derived through sesquilinear forms. We obtain a rigorous characterization of self-adjointness which indicates how to introduce a new notion of strong eigenvalues. For every compact, para-linear, self-adjoint operator with strong eigenvalues, we can establish the spectral decomposition theorem and functional calculi.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the canonical Brownian motion in non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the canonical Brownian motion on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ (which is the range of parameter values in which loops of the CLE$_\kappa$ can intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary). More precisely, we show that there is a unique diffusion process on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket whose law depends locally on the CLE$_\kappa$ and satisfies certain natural properties such as translation-invariance and scale-invariance (modulo time change). We characterize the diffusion process by its resistance form and show in particular that there is a unique resistance form on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket that is locally determined by the CLE$_\kappa$ and satisfies certain natural properties such as translation-invariance and scale-covariance. We conjecture that the CLE$_\kappa$ Brownian motion describes the scaling limit of simple random walk on statistical mechanics models in two dimensions that converge to CLE$_\kappa$. In future work the results of this paper will be used to show that this is the case with $\kappa=6$ for critical percolation on the triangular lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12362v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of regularized integrals introduced by Li-Zhou that aims to assign finite values to divergent integrals on configuration spaces of Riemann surfaces. We then give cohomological formulations for the extended notion using the tools of current cohomology and mixed Hodge structures. We also provide practical ways of constructing representatives of the corresponding cohomology classes in terms of smooth differential forms.</description>

      <title>On elliptic and quasiregularly elliptic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his book "Metric structures for Riemannian and non-Riemannian spaces", Gromov defined two properties of Riemannian manifolds, ellipticity and quasiregular ellipticity, and suggested that there may be a connection between the two. Since then, groups of researchers working independently have proved strikingly similar results about these two concepts. We obtain new topological obstructions to the two properties: most notably, we show that closed manifolds of both types must have virtually abelian fundamental group. We also give the first examples of open manifolds which are elliptic but not quasireguarly elliptic and vice versa. Whether there is a direct connection between these properties -- and, in particular, whether they are equivalent for closed manifolds -- remains elusive.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the canonical geodesic metric on the gasket of conformal loop ensembles (CLE$_\kappa$) in the regime $\kappa \in (4,8)$ where the loops intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary. Previous work of the authors and V. Ambrosio showed that the subsequential limits associated with certain approximation procedures for such a metric exist and are non-trivial. In this work, we show that the limit exists by proving that there is at most one geodesic metric on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket which satisfies certain properties. Further, we obtain that the limit is conformally covariant. This paper is the foundation of future work which show that the metric for $\kappa=6$ is the continuum scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for critical percolation in two dimensions. We further conjecture that for $\kappa \in (4,8)$, the geodesic CLE$_\kappa$ metric is the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric associated with discrete models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$.</description>
