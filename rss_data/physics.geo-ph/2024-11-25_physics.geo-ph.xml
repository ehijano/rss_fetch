      <title>Hydrodynamics of fault gouges from constitutive modelling to the physics of friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of rate- and state-dependent friction laws offered important insights into the key physical mechanisms of the frictional behaviour of fault gouges and their seismic cycle. However, past approaches were specifically tailored to address the problem of fault shearing, leaving questions about their ability to comprehensively represent the gouge material under general loading conditions. This work establishes an alternative approach for developing a physical friction law for fault gouges that is grounded on the rigour of the hydrodynamic procedure with two-scale temperatures through Terracotta, a thoroughly robust constitutive model for clay in triaxial loading conditions. By specifying the model for direct shearing, the approach yields an alternative friction law that readily captures the frictional dynamics of fault gouges, including explicit dependencies on gouge layer thickness, normal stress, and solid fraction. Validated against available laboratory experiments, the friction law retains the original predictive capabilities of Terracotta in triaxial conditions and explains the rate- and state-dependent, dilatational behaviour of fault gouges in direct shear conditions. Finally, when the Terracotta friction law is connected to a spring-dashpot representation of the host rock, the combined model predicts an elastic buildup precursor to the onset of and subsequent seismicity, with results closely reflecting experimental evidence and field observations. While this study focuses on clay-rich gouges, the approach and findings are expected to offer much wider implications to a variety of materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoretic transport of colloids in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how colloids move in crowded environments is key for gaining control over their transport in applications such as drug delivery, filtration, contaminant/microplastic remediation and agriculture. The classical models of colloid transport in porous media rely on geometric characteristics of the medium, and hydrodynamic/non-hydrodynamic equilibrium interactions to predict their behavior. However, chemical gradients are ubiquitous in these environments and can lead to the non-equilibrium diffusiophoretic migration of colloids. Here, combining microfluidic experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical modeling we demonstrate that diffusiophoresis leads to significant macroscopic changes in the dispersion of colloids in porous media. We displace a suspension of colloids dispersed in a background salt solution with a higher/lower salinity solution and monitor the removal of the colloids from the medium. While mixing weakens the solute gradients, leading to the diffusiophoretic velocities that are orders of magnitude weaker than the background fluid flow, we show that the cross-streamline migration of colloids changes their macroscopic transit time and dispersion through the medium by an order of magnitude compared to the control case with no salinity gradients. Our observations demonstrate that solute gradients modulate the influence of geometric disorder on the transport, pointing to the need for revisiting the classical models of colloid transport in porous media to obtain predictive models for technological, medical, and environmental applications.</description>
