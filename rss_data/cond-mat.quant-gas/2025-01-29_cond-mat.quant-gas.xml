      <title>Induced Interactions and Bipolarons in Spin-Orbit Coupled Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can interact indirectly through the exchange of Bogoliubov excitations. These impurities, which form dressed quasiparticles known as Bose polarons due to their interaction with the BEC, can pair up to form a bound state called bipolarons, via an induced interaction. Previous studies on induced interactions have primarily focused on cases with an isotropic excitation spectrum. In this work, we investigate the properties of induced interactions and bipolarons mediated by anisotropic Bogoliubov excitations using field theory. Taking a BEC with spin-orbit coupling as an example, we show that the induced interaction becomes anisotropic. Notably, a double-minima feature appears in the induced interaction in momentum space due to the exchange of roton excitations. Additionally, we calculate the binding energy and wave functions of these bipolarons induced by anisotropic interactions. Unlike previously studied bipolarons formed through the exchange of isotropic phonon excitations, we identify a new type of bipolarons whose wave functions feature a double-peak structure under strong impurity-boson interactions. Our work extends the theory of induced interactions from isotropic to anisotropic systems, and reveals the novel features in both the induced interactions and bipolarons arising from BEC with an unconventional excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Strongly Repulsive 1D Gases at Higher Branches: Spin-Charge Correlation and Coupled Spin-Chain Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the higher repulsive branches of one-dimensional (1D) bosonic and fermionic quantum gases beyond the super-Tonks-Girardeau regime, utilizing the Bethe-Ansatz method and exact diagonalization of small trapped clusters. In contrast to the well-studied lowest branches that are characterized by spin-charge separation, we demonstrate the emergence of strong spin-charge correlation in all higher branches with hard-core interactions. This manifests in distinct quasi-momentum distributions and energy spectra for bosons and spin-1/2 fermions, despite their fermionization. Furthermore, trapped fermions in higher branches exhibit novel spin textures, intricately linked to charge excitations, necessitating a coupled multi-chain description beyond single effective spin-chain models. Our findings unveil a rich interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom in highly excited 1D systems, opening avenues for exploring novel quantum phenomena beyond the conventional paradigm of low-lying states.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum many-body dynamics using subsystem Loschmidt echos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo - the probability of a quantum many-body system to return to its initial state following a dynamical evolution - generally contains key information about a quantum system, relevant across various scientific fields including quantum chaos, quantum many-body physics, or high-energy physics. However, it is typically exponentially small in system size, posing an outstanding challenge for experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the subsystem Loschmidt echo, a quasi-local observable that captures key features of the Loschmidt echo while being readily accessible experimentally. Utilizing quantum gas microscopy, we study its short- and long-time dynamics. In the short-time regime, we observe a dynamical quantum phase transition arising from genuine higher-order correlations. In the long-time regime, the subsystem Loschmidt echo allows us to quantitatively determine the effective dimension and structure of the accessible Hilbert space in the thermodynamic limit. Performing these measurements in the ergodic regime and in the presence of emergent kinetic constraints, we provide direct experimental evidence for ergodicity breaking due to fragmentation of the Hilbert space. Our results establish the subsystem Loschmidt echo as a novel and powerful tool that allows paradigmatic studies of both non-equilibrium dynamics and equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum many-body systems, applicable to a broad range of quantum simulation and computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Self-induced Josephson oscillations and self-trapping in a supersolid dipolar quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson effect characterizes superfluids and superconductors separated by a weak link, the so-called Josephson junction. A recent experiment has shown that Josephson oscillations can be observed also in a supersolid, where the weak link is not due to an external barrier, but is self-induced by interparticle interactions. Here we show theoretically that supersolids -- despite their self-induced character -- feature all the standard properties of bosonic Josephson junction arrays, including macroscopic quantum self-trapping. We focus on the harmonically trapped dipolar supersolids of interest for current experiments, and show that they can be described with a generalized Josephson model that takes into account spatial inhomogeneities. Our work shades new light on the dynamics of supersolids and opens the way to the study of a novel class of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced fragmentation and dissipative time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general protocol for engineering dissipative time crystals in quantum open systems through symmetry-induced fragmentation and ergodicity breaking. Building upon a U(1)-symmetry-induced Liouville-space fragmentation, we devise a generic Liouvillian possessing a series of non-dissipative eigenmodes with purely imaginary eigenvalues, which give rise to long-time oscillations breaking both ergodicity and time-translation symmetry. Illustrating our proposal using a dissipative lattice model, we show that, even when the U(1) symmetry is broken, a prethermal time-crystal behavior survives, with distinct oscillation frequencies at different times of the steady-state approaching dynamics. The richly structured prethermal dynamics derive from Fermi statistics and the Liouvillian skin effect of our model, under which excitations above the boundary-localized dark states can be mapped to the irreducible representations of the permutation group. The branching rules of the permutation group then dictate that the Liouvillian gaps acquired by the non-dissipative eigenmodes should be higher-order powers of the symmetry-breaking perturbation, protecting the prethermal time crystal.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Boson-fermion pairing and condensation in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mixture of bosons and spin-polarized fermions in two dimensions at zero temperature with a tunable Bose-Fermi attraction. By adopting a diagrammatic T-matrix approach, we analyze the behavior of several thermodynamic quantities for the two species as a function of the density ratio and coupling strength, including the chemical potentials, the momentum distribution functions, the boson condensate density, and the Tan's contact parameter. By increasing the Bose-Fermi attraction, we find that the condensate is progressively depleted and Bose-Fermi pairs form, with a small fraction of condensed bosons surviving even for strong Bose-Fermi attraction. This small condensate proves sufficient to hybridize molecular and atomic states, producing quasi-particles with unusual Fermi liquid features. A nearly universal behavior of the condensate fraction, the bosonic momentum distribution, and Tan's contact parameter with respect to the density ratio is also found.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>
