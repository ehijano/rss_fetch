      <title>CTA and SWGO can Discover Higgsino Dark Matter Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal higgsino dark matter (DM), with a mass near 1.1 TeV, is one of the most well-motivated and untested DM candidates. Leveraging recent hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that give DM density profiles in Milky Way analogue galaxies we show that the line-like gamma-ray signal predicted from higgsino annihilation in the Galactic Center could be detected at high significance with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) for all but the most pessimistic DM profiles. We perform the most sensitive search to-date for the line-like signal using 15 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, coming within an order one factor of the necessary sensitivity to detect the higgsino for some Milky Way analogue DM density profiles. We show that H.E.S.S. has sub-leading sensitivity relative to Fermi for the higgsino at present. In contrast, we analyze H.E.S.S. inner Galaxy data for the thermal wino model with a mass near 2.8 TeV; we find no evidence for a DM signal and exclude the wino by over a factor of two in cross-section for all DM profiles considered. In the process, we identify and attempt to correct what appears to be an inconsistency in previous H.E.S.S. inner Galaxy analyses for DM annihilation related to the analysis effective area, which may weaken the DM cross-section sensitivity claimed in those works by around an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Probing CP Violation and Mass Hierarchy in Neutrino Oscillations in Matter through Quantum Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve from a given initial state to a final state. In this work, we investigate CP violation and the mass hierarchy problem of neutrino oscillations in matter using the QSL time as a key analytical tool. We examine the QSL time for the unitary evolution of two- and three-flavor neutrino states, both in vacuum and in the presence of matter. Two-flavor neutrino oscillations are used as a precursor to their three-flavor counterparts. We further compute the QSL time for neutrino state evolution and entanglement in terms of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities, which are experimentally measurable quantities in neutrino experiments. A difference in the QSL time between the normal and inverted mass hierarchy scenarios, for neutrino state evolution as well as for entanglement, under the effect of a CP violation phase is observed. Our results are illustrated using energy-varying sets of accelerator neutrino sources from experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and DUNE. Notably, three-flavor neutrino oscillations in constant matter density exhibit faster state evolution across all these neutrino experiments in the normal mass hierarchy scenario. Additionally, we observe fast entanglement growth in DUNE assuming a normal mass hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Expansion by regions meets angular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the small-mass asymptotic behavior of so-called angular integrals, appearing in phase-space calculations in perturbative quantum field theory. For this purpose we utilize the strategy of expansion by regions, which is a universal method both for multiloop Feynman integrals and various parametric integrals. To apply the technique to angular integrals, we convert them into suitable parametric integral representations, which are accessible to existing automation tools. We use the the code \texttt{asy.m} to reveal regions contributing to the asymptotic expansion of angular integrals. To evaluate the contributions of these regions in an epsilon expansion we apply the method of Mellin-Barnes representation. Our approach is checked against existing results on angular integrals revealing a connection between contributing regions and angular integrals constructed from an algebraic decomposition. We explicitly calculate the previously unknown asymptotics for angular integrals with three and four denominators and formulate a conjecture for the leading asymptotics and the pole part for a general number of denominators and masses.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing Matter through a Long-Range Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a long-range force, mediated by an ultralight scalar, which can give rise to violation of baryon number. This would lead to very different lifetimes for nucleons in different astrophysical environments. Possible signals of this scenario include a flux of O(10 MeV) solar neutrinos or anomalous heating of old neutron stars; we find the latter to yield the strongest current bounds, which could be improved in the coming years. The ultralight scalar employed here can potentially be a good dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal angular correlations in lepton pair production in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent photons induced by relativistic heavy ions are highly linearly polarized, in close analogy to the linear polarization of gluons in a large nucleus. We proposed to measure the photon polarization through azimuthal asymmetries in dilepton production in ultra-peripheral collisions. Our prediction for the asymmetries were soon confirmed by the STAR experiment with high precision. We refined our analysis recently by including the final state soft photon radiation effect beyond the double leading logarithm approximation. The azimuthal asymmetries and acoplanarity at relatively high transverse momentum provide unique opportunities to test the resummation formalism thanks to the extremely high photon flux in UPCs. Our results clearly show the feasibility to access the sub-leading resummation effects in UPCs at the RHIC and LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four 3-loop two-point functions are studied analytically and numerically using a simplified sector decomposition method. The coefficients of the ultraviolet divergent part are determined analytically, and those of the finite part are computed numerically.

      <title>How Viable Is a QCD Axion near 10 MeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been an attempt to revive the visible QCD axion at the 10 MeV scale assuming that it exclusively couples to the first-generation quarks and the electron. This variant of the QCD axion is claimed to remain phenomenologically viable, partly due to a clever model construction that induces tree-level pion-phobia and exploits uncertainties inherent in the chiral perturbation theory. We confront this model with the cosmological domain wall problem, the quality issue and constraints arising from the electron electric dipole moment. It is also pointed out that the gluon loop-generated axion-top coupling can provide a very large contribution to rare $B$-meson decays, such that the present LHCb data for $B^0 \to K^{*0} e^+ e^-$ rule out the model for the axion mass larger than 30 MeV. There is a strong motivation for pushing the experimental analysis of $B \to K^{(*)} e^+ e^-$ to a lower $e^+ e^-$ invariant mass window, which will conclusively determine the fate of the model, as its contribution to this branching ratio significantly exceeds the Standard Model prediction.</description>

      <title>Search for single vector-like $B$ quark production in hadronic final states at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discovery potential of a Vector-Like $B$ quark (VLB) via the process $pp \to B(\to bZ)j\to b(Z \to \nu_l\bar{\nu_l})j$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV. In the framework of a simplified model, we perform a scan over its parameter space and test its viability following a Monte Carlo analysis developed to include all production and decay dynamics. We use cut-and-count combined with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) methods to classify the signal and background events in order to improve the efficiency of signal identification and background rejection. We find that this approach can reduce background events significantly while the signal retention rate is much higher than that of traditional methods, thereby improving the VLB discovery potential. We then calculate the exclusion and discovery capabilities for VLBs and find that the advantages of the cut-and-count plus XGBoost method especially lie in the high-mass region, i.e., $m_B &gt; 1500\text{ GeV}$. We finally obtain the following LHC results in terms of the coupling and chiral structure of a singlet heavy VLB interactions: (i) for $g^{\ast}$=0.2 and $R_L=0$ with 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the $B$ quark mass can be be excluded (discovered) up to 3000 GeV (2500 GeV); (ii) for $g^{\ast}$=0.2 and $R_L=0.5$ with 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the exclusion (discovery) region can reach up to 4750 GeV (4250 GeV).</description>

      <title>Minimal eclectic flavor group $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ and neutrino mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the minimal eclectic flavor group $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ which is isomorphic to $GL(2,3)$, and all its irreducible representations are induced from the irreducible representations of $Q_{8}$ and $S_{3}$. The consistency conditions between EFG and generalized CP (gCP) symmetry are revisited, and we find the gCP symmetry compatible with the minimal EFG $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$. The most general forms of K\"ahler potential and superpotential based on $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ are discussed, and the corresponding fermion mass matrices are presented. A concrete lepton model invariant under $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ and gCP is constructed, in which the experimental data of all six lepton masses and six mixing parameters can be successfully described through seven real input parameters. The model predicts a vanishing effective mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Equivariant neural networks for robust $\textit{CP}$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the usage of equivariant neural networks in the search for violations of the charge-parity ($\textit{CP}$) symmetry in particle interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We design neural networks that take as inputs kinematic information of recorded events and that transform equivariantly under the a symmetry group related to the $\textit{CP}$ transformation. We show that this algorithm allows to define observables reflecting the properties of the $\textit{CP}$ symmetry, showcasing its performance in several reference processes in top quark and electroweak physics. Imposing equivariance as an inductive bias in the algorithm improves the numerical convergence properties with respect to other methods that do not rely on equivariance and allows to construct optimal observables that significantly improve the state-of-the-art methodology in the searches considered.</description>

      <title>Model-independent extrapolation of MUonE data with Pad\'e and D-Log approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment is designed to extract the hadronic contribution to the electromagnetic coupling in the space-like region, $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$, from elastic $e\mu$ scattering. The leading order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon $g-2$, $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP, \,LO}}$, can then be obtained from a weighted integral over $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$. This, however, requires knowledge of $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$ in the whole domain of integration, which cannot be achieved by experiment. In this work, we propose to use Pad\'e and D-Log Pad\'e approximants as a systematic and model-independent method to fit and reliably extrapolate the future MUonE experimental data, extracting $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,\,LO}}$ with a conservative but competitive uncertainty, using no, or very limited, external information. The method relies on fundamental analytic properties of the two-point correlator underlying $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,\,LO}}$ and provides lower and upper bounds for the result for $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,\,LO}}$. We demonstrate the reliability of the method using toy data sets generated from a model for $\Delta \alpha_{\rm had}(t)$ reflecting the expected statistics of the MUonE experiment.</description>

      <title>TMD Relations: Insights from a Light-Front Quark-Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have established the relations between the T-even proton transverse momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs) at all twist levels up to twist-4 using the light-front quark diquark model (LFQDM). From the parameterization equations of TMDs, we have found that there are multiple ways by which a particular TMD can be expressed in terms of the helicities of the proton in the initial and final states. For the first time, we have presented a parameterization table that can be applied to the derivation and recognition of proton TMDs based on their helicity. We have constructed the linear and quadratic relationships of TMDs at the intra-twist and inter-twist levels within the same model. We have also looked at the inequality relations that TMDs follow. Additionally, to provide an easy access to the calculations, amplitude matrices have been expressed in the form of TMDs over all the possible helicities of the diquark.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes my personal appreciation for some of the great research achievements of Mitya Diakonov, Vitya Petrov, and Maxim Polyakov and how my own research career has followed the paths they opened. Among the topics where they have been the most influential have been the pursuit and study of the exotic pentaquark. The search for exotics may require a complementary approach, such as experimental and theoretical activity. Here, I would like to focus on a story of $N(1680)$ in which I was involved.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated and improved global fit analysis of precision and flavor observables so as to derive constraints on deviations from unitarity in the leptonic mixing matrix. We focus on the case in which these deviations are sourced by heavy neutrinos, such that our results can also be interpreted as bounds on their mixing with the active flavors. Our analysis is motivated by new results on key observables, such as $M_W$, $|V_{ud}|$ and $\Gamma_{\text{inv}}$.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of unpolarized quark Transverse Momentum Distributions from a global fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extraction of the unpolarized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions that takes into account possible differences between quark flavors and final-state hadrons. The extraction is based on experimental measurements from Drell-Yan processes and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, whose combination is essential to distinguish flavor differences. The analysis is carried out at N$^3$LL accuracy. The extracted flavor-dependent distributions give a very good description of the data ($\chi^2/N_{\rm dat} = 1.08$). The resulting uncertainties take fully into account also the uncertainties in the determination of the corresponding collinear distributions.</description>

      <title>Resonant Conversion of Wave Dark Matter in the Ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider resonant wave-like dark matter conversion into low-frequency radio waves in the Earth's ionosphere. Resonant conversion occurs when the dark matter mass and the plasma frequency coincide, defining a range $m_{ \text{DM} } \sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$ eV where this approach is best suited. Owing to the non-relativistic nature of dark matter and the typical variational scale of the Earth's ionosphere, the standard linearized approach to computing dark matter conversion is not suitable. We therefore solve a second-order boundary-value problem, effectively framing the ionosphere as a driven cavity filled with a positionally-varying plasma. An electrically-small dipole antenna targeting the generated radio waves can be orders of magnitude more sensitive to dark photon and axion-like particle dark matter in the relevant mass range. The present study opens up a promising way of testing hitherto unexplored parameter space which could be further improved with a dedicated instrument.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Heavy Particles during and after Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational production of a scalar field $\chi$ with a mass exceeding the Hubble scale during inflation $m_\chi \gtrsim H_I$, employing both analytical and numerical approaches. We demonstrate that the steepest descent method effectively captures the epochs and yields of gravitational production in a compact and simple analytical framework. These analytical results align with the numerical solutions of the field equation. Our study covers three spacetime backgrounds: de Sitter, power-law inflation, and the Starobinsky inflation model. Within these models, we identify two distinct phases of particle production: during and after inflation. During inflation, we derive an accurate analytic expression for the particle production rate, accounting for a varying Hubble rate. After inflation, the additional burst of particle production depends on the inflaton mass around its minimum. When this mass is smaller than the Hubble scale during inflation, $H_I$, there is no significant extra production. However, if the inflaton mass is larger, post-inflation production becomes the dominant contribution. Furthermore, we explore the implications of gravitationally produced heavy fields for dark matter abundance, assuming their cosmological stability.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Non-flow Contributions to the Elliptic Flow Parameter ($v_{_2}$) in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the elliptic flow parameter, $v_{_2}$, in proton-proton (p-p) collisions using PYTHIA8 event generator simulations. The typical Event Plane (EP) method $v_{_2}$(EP) besides the algorithm used for the real data analysis has been adopted to measure the $v_{_2}$ of particles composed of different quark flavors. The $v_{_2}$ of the aforementioned particles was measured at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{S_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV and $\sqrt{S_{_{NN}}}$ = 13 TeV. The pseudorapidity gap techniques, theoretically defined as $|\Delta\eta| = |\eta_{_{particle}} - \eta_{_{EP}}|$, between the particle of interest and the soft particles, $p_{_{t}}$ $\leq$ 2 GeV/c, used for the event plane determinations, have been implemented in the current measurements. The $v_{_2}^{\pi^{^\pm,}\pi^{^0}}$, $v_{_2}^{J/\psi,\Upsilon, K, D, B}$, and the $v_{_2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ show similar pattern dependence on the transverse momentum for the same $|\Delta\eta|$, at both $\sqrt{S_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV and $\sqrt{S_{_{NN}}}$ = 13 TeV. At each center-of-mass energy, the $v_{_2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ $\le$ $v_{_2}^{J/\psi, \Upsilon, K, D, B}$ $\le$ $v_{_2}^{\pi^{^\pm,}\pi^{^0}}$ for similar $|\Delta\eta|$. The measured $v_{_2}$ shows slightly higher values at smaller $\sqrt{S_{_{NN}}}$ for particles of similar $|\Delta\eta|$, particularly at small $|\Delta\eta|$. The measured $v_{_2}$ for all particles shows systematic decreases with increasing the $|\Delta\eta|$ gaps as expected. Since PYTHIA8 does not include final state interactions, the reported $v_{_2}$(EP) is mainly due to the non-flow contributions which should be subtracted from the signal in the real data analysis that uses the same event plane determination algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pion gravitational form factors in the QCD instanton vacuum I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pion form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor (EMT) are studied in the instanton liquid model (ILM) of the QCD vacuum. In this approach the breaking of conformal symmetry is encoded in the form of stronger-than-Poisson fluctuations in the number of instantons. For the trace of the EMT, it is shown that the gluonic trace anomaly term contributes half the pion mass, with the other half coming from the quark-mass-dependent sigma term. The $Q^2$ dependence of the form factors is governed by glueball and scalar meson exchanges. For the traceless EMT, the spin-0 and 2 form factors are computed at next-to-leading order in the instanton density using effective quark operators. Relations between the gluon and quark contributions to the EMT form factors are derived. The form factors are also expressed in terms of the pion light-front wave functions in the ILM. The results at the low resolution scale of the inverse instanton size are evolved to higher scales using the renormalization group equation. The ILM results compare well with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Flavino Dark Matter in a Non-Abelian Discrete Flavor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a relic density of the flavino dark matter in modified Altarelli and Feruglio $A_4$ model which is respecting the $SU(2)_L\times A_4\times Z_3\times U(1)_R$ symmetry. We calculate the Lagrangian from the superpotential in the model. In estimating relic density, we consider the relevant interactions from the Lagrangian that realize the vacuum expectation value alignments and charged lepton masses where we assume that the supersymmetry breaking effects are small for flavon sector. As a result, we find the degenerate masses between the lightest ``flavon'' and ``flavino'', and only two parameters in the potential determines the relic density. Then allowed parameter space of these parameters are estimated from relic density calculation taking a constraint from lepton flavor violation into account. We also briefly discuss other dark matter physics such as direct detection, indirect detection and collider search.</description>

      <title>Strangelets at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of strangelets at finite temperature $T$, employing an equivparticle model that incorporates both linear confinement and leading-order perturbative interactions with density-dependent quark masses. The shell effects are analyzed by solving the Dirac equations for quarks within the mean-field approximation. As temperature increases, these effects weaken due to the occupation probability of single-particle levels being governed by the Fermi-Dirac statistics, a phenomenon known as shell dampening. Surprisingly, the surface tension, derived from a liquid-drop formula, does not decrease with temperature but instead rises until it peaks at $T \approx 20-40$ MeV. At this temperature, shell corrections become negligible, and the formula provides a reasonable approximation for the free energy per baryon of strangelets. However, the curvature term decreases with $T$ despite the presence of shell effects. The neutron and proton emission rates are determined microscopically by the external nucleon gas densities that are in equilibrium with strangelets. These emission rate generally increases with $T$ for stable strangelets, but decrease for those that are unstable to nucleon emission at $T$ = 0. The other properties of $\beta$-stable strangelets obtained with various parameter sets are presented as well. The results indicated in this work are useful for understanding the products of binary compact star mergers and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Explore the properties of $\Lambda(1670)$ in the Cabibbo-favored process $\Lambda^+_c \to p K^- \pi^+$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Belle and LHCb Collaborations have measured the $\Lambda^+_c \to p K^- \pi^+$ decay and reported the $p K^-$ invariant mass distribution, which shows a clear cusp structure around the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold. In this work, we have analyzed this process by considering the triangle mechanism and the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach, which dynamically generate the $\Lambda(1670)$. Our results are in good agreement with the Belle measurements, which implies that the cusp structure around $\eta\Lambda$ threshold could be associated with the $\Lambda(1670)$ with the molecular nature.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Signal from $Z_{N\geq 3}$ Dark Matter-Companion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Guo:2021rre}, we proposed to replace the final dark matter (DM) particle in the semi-annihilation mode $\rm DM+DM\to antiDM+Higgs~boson$ with its $Z_{N\geq 3}$ companion, thus reducing DM number density without DM-nucleon scattering. In this work, we study the indirect detection signals from DM annihilation, the Higgs boson pair with one of them from the companion decay being on- or off- shell, depending on the DM-companion mass splitting. We generate the photon spectrum by using PYTHIA8 and study the properties of the spectrum, to find that the hard part of the spectrum in our model is mainly shaped by the direct Higgs boson and thus does not differ much from that of the conventional semi-annihilation mode. Using the Fermi-LAT data of white dwarfs, we derive the current limit of the DM annihilation cross section for ${\rm DM+DM\to companion^*+Higgs~ boson}$, and for the relatively light DM, it reaches the typical thermal cross section. However, for the TeV scale DM, we have to rely on the Cherenkov Telescope Array, which is able to rule out the whole parameter space except for the coannihilation region.</description>

      <title>Thermal Wash-in Leptogenesis via Heavy Higgs Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conceptually simple model to generate asymmetries that are not directly related to baryon nor lepton charges. The model employs a three-Higgs doublet framework, wherein the other two Higgs fields are significantly heavier than the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field. The decay of these heavier Higgs fields generates asymmetry for approximately conserved charges in the Standard Model at a high temperature. These asymmetries will be converted into baryon/lepton asymmetry through $B-L$ violating interactions associated with right-handed neutrinos via the wash-in mechanism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update and extend a previous N$^3$LL$^\prime$+${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$ strong coupling determination from thrust data. In particular, we carry out a fit with data fully restricted to the dijet region seeking to minimize the potential impact of power corrections that go beyond dijet configurations. In addition, we parametrize deviations from the dijet power correction in order to add an additional source of uncertainty in the result for $\alpha_s(m_Z)$. We also show that the inclusion of resummation is important to achieve stability with respect to varying the fit region.</description>

      <title>Hadronic molecules with four charm or beauty quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the extended local hidden gauge formalism to study the meson-meson interactions with the quark constituents $cc\bar c\bar c$, $cc\bar c\bar b/\bar c\bar c cb$, $cc\bar b\bar b/\bar c\bar c bb$, $bb\bar c\bar b/\bar b\bar b cb$, and $bb\bar b\bar b$, where the exchanged mesons can only be the fully-heavy vector mesons $J/\psi$, $B_c^*$, and $\Upsilon$. We solve the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation to derive two poles in the $bb\bar c\bar b$ system and two poles in the $cc\bar c\bar b$ system (with four charge-conjugated poles in the $\bar b\bar b cb$ and $\bar c\bar c cb$ systems): one pole existing in the $bb\bar c\bar b$ system corresponds to the sub-threshold bound state when setting the cutoff momentum $\Lambda &gt; 850$ MeV, while it causes the threshold effect with $\Lambda &lt; 850$ MeV; the other pole existing in this system corresponds to the sub-threshold bound state with $\Lambda &gt; 1100$ MeV; the two poles existing in the $cc\bar c\bar b$ system correspond to the sub-threshold bound states only when setting $\Lambda &gt; 1550$ MeV and $\Lambda &gt; 2650$ MeV, making them difficult to be identified as deeply-bound hadronic molecules. We propose to investigate the two poles of the $bb\bar c\bar b$ system in the $\mu^+\mu^-B_c^-$ channel at LHC.</description>

      <title>Progress in implementing the kinematical constraint into the small-x JIMWLK evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most complete high-energy evolution of Wilson line operators is described by the set of equations called Balitsky-JIMWLK evolution equations. It is known from the studies of the linear - the BFKL - evolution equation that the leading corrections come from the kinematically enhanced double collinear logarithms. A method for resumming such logarithmic corrections to all orders for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation is known under the name of kinematical constraint. In this work, we discuss the progress in implementing these corrections into the Langevin formulation of the JIMWLK equation. In particular, we introduce a set of correlation functions which are nonlocal in the rapidity variable. They appear in the construction of the kinematical constraint, however, their behavior with rapidity has not been investigated numerically so far. We derive their large-$N$ evolution equations, solve them numerically, and comment on their implications for the implementation of the full kinematical constraint.</description>

      <title>Testing the CKM unitarity at high energy via the $W^+W^-$ production at the LHC and future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel test to assess the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, $V_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm CKM}}$, at present and future collider experiments. Our strategy makes use of the $W^+W^-$ production cross section to directly probe the $V_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm CKM}}^{\dagger} V_{\scriptscriptstyle{\rm CKM}}$ product, which regulates the high-energy behavior of the observable. The violation of unitarity is signalled by an anomalous behavior of the cross section that grows quadratically with the $W^+W^-$ invariant mass with respect to the Standard Model prediction. By using the recent ATLAS measurements of the $W^+W^-$ cross section we are able to constrain the maximal unitarity violation allowed by current data, producing a bound complementary to the results of flavor physics experiments. Forecasts for the high luminosity phase of the LHC and for the future 100 TeV hadron collider are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the phenomenology of a simplified dark matter model within the dark minimal flavor violation framework, extending the standard model with a Majorana fermion flavor triplet and colored scalar mediator. We explore the allowed parameter space considering constraints from flavor observables, direct and indirect dark matter detection, and the relic density measurement. Our analysis reveals previously unexplored scenarios such as conversion-driven freeze-out within the model. We study limits from the LHC and discuss new signatures of the model, highlighting its richer phenomenology compared to single flavor dark matter.</description>

      <title>Blade: A package for block-triangular form improved Feynman integrals decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present the package Blade as the first implementation of the block-triangular form improved Feynman integral reduction method. The block-triangular form has orders of magnitude fewer equations compared to the plain integration-by-parts system, allowing for strictly block-by-block solutions. This results in faster evaluations and reduced resource consumption. We elucidate the algorithms involved in obtaining the block-triangular form along with their implementations. Additionally, we introduce novel algorithms for finding the canonical form and symmetry relations of Feynman integrals, as well as for performing spanning-sector reduction. Our benchmarks for various state-of-the-art problems demonstrate that Blade is remarkably competitive among existing reduction tools. Furthermore, the Blade package offers several distinctive features, including support for complex kinematic variables or masses, user-defined Feynman prescriptions for each propagator, and general integrands.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is devoted to dilaton generation in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in a galactic magnetic field. It is shown that in this process it's necessary to take into account the presence of a reflective index of matter distributed in the galaxy. According to obtained estimates influence of the gravitational field of pulsars and magnetars on radiation of magnetic dipole waves is negligible and tends to a small change of their amplitude, near about 1 per cent. That's why in this study one can neglect the impact of gravitational field on process of dilaton generation.
  Exact solution of the dilaton equation is found and angular distribution of dilaton radiation is obtained in propagation of magnetic dipole waves of pulsar in galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Expanding Microscopic Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two interesting hypotheses about black holes have been proposed. The older one states that microscopic black holes can be accountable for the observed dark matter density. The newer one states that black holes are coupled to the expansion of the universe. Here, we combine those ideas and investigate the behaviour of expanding microscopic black holes. We observe two temperatures at which the radiation balances the expansion. While one of the balance points might be important in the analysis of primordial scenarios, the other would lead to a strong diffuse gamma radiation background, which is contradicted by the lack of observations. This establishes another indirect evidence disfavouring the hypothesis of cosmological coupling of black holes.</description>

      <title>LISA double white dwarf binaries as Galactic accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are among the guaranteed sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) detector. Most DWDs in the LISA band are far from merging and emit quasimonochromatic GWs. As these sources are distributed throughout the Milky Way, they experience different accelerations in the Galactic gravitational potential, and therefore each DWD exhibits an apparent GW frequency chirp due to differential acceleration between the source and LISA. We examine how Galactic acceleration influences parameter estimation for these sources; and investigate how LISA observations could provide insight into the distribution of matter in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physics with the Lyman-alpha forest: constraints on the growth of structure and neutrino masses from SDSS with effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) approach to extract fundamental cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations as an alternative to the standard simulation-based techniques. As a first application, we re-analyze the publicly available one-dimensional Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum (FPS) data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our analysis relies on informative priors on EFT parameters which we extract from a combination of public hydrodynamic simulation and emulator data. Assuming the concordance cosmological model, our one-parameter analysis yields a $2\%$ measurement of the late time mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.841\pm 0.017$, or equivalently,the structure growth parameter $S_8 = 0.852\pm 0.017$, consistent with the standard cosmology. Combining our EFT likelihood with Planck + baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find a new constraint on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;$ 0.08 eV (at 95\% CL). Our study defines priorities for the development of EFT methods and sets the benchmark for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Accelerating universe at early and late times in extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scenario that can explain the early-time inflation and the late-time dark energy within a unified framework. A scalar potential combining power-law and exponential type in a context of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity is critically important for this realization. A realistic scenario can be achieved in a two-field model in which one directional motion in field space realizes the slow-roll inflation. The inflaton ends up with oscillatory period and turns its direction to another direction that is identified as the quintessence field, giving rise to the dark energy at late times. The inflaton oscillation is expected to realize efficient heating if parametric amplification works. Along the quintessence direction, the present universe is on the way to reach the asymptotic fixed point. We search for successful parameter region, taking potential function in the form of low-order field powers times decreasing exponential in two dimensional field space.</description>

      <title>Induced Isotensor Interactions in Heavy-Ion Double-Charge-Exchange Reactions and the Role of Initial and Final State Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of initial state (ISI) and final state (FSI) ion-ion interactions in heavy-ion double-charge-exchange (DCE) reactions $A(Z,N)\to A(Z\pm 2,N\mp 2)$ are studied for double single-charge-exchange (DSCE) reactions given by sequential actions of the isovector nucleon-nucleon (NN) T-matrix. In momentum representation, the second-order DSCE reaction amplitude is shown to be given in factorized form by projectile and target nuclear matrix elements and a reaction kernel containing ISI and FSI. Expanding the intermediate propagator in a Taylor series with respect to auxiliary energy allows us to perform the summation in the leading-order term over intermediate nuclear states in closure approximation. %Please ensure meaning has been retained - corrected HL. The nuclear matrix element attains a form given by the products of two-body interactions directly exciting the $n^2p^{-2}$ and $p^2n^{-2}$ DCE transitions in the projectile and the target nucleus, respectively. %Please ensure meaning has been retained - corrected HL. A surprising result is that the intermediate propagation induces correlations between the transition vertices, showing that DSCE reactions are a two-nucleon process that resembles a system of interacting spin-isospin dipoles. Transformation of the DSCE NN T-matrix interactions from the reaction theoretical t-channel form to the s-channel operator structure required for spectroscopic purposes is elaborated in detail, showing that, in general, a rich spectrum of spin scalar, spin vector and higher-rank spin tensor multipole transitions will contribute to a DSCE reaction. Similarities (and differences) to two-neutrino double-beta decay (DBD) are discussed. ISI/FSI distortion and absorption effects are illustrated in black sphere approximation and in an illustrative application to data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the Higgs boson discovery in 2012, the experiments at the LHC are continuing to study this particle and look for physics beyond the standard model. Some of the Higgs boson properties, such as the mass, has been measured with sub-percent level accuracy. Yet the present integrated luminosity is still a limiting factor for measuring the Higgs boson self-coupling or the first generation Yukawa couplings. The current constraints on the Higgs boson couplings would still allow for a sizeable branching fraction into undetected final states, which motivates the direct searches for rare and exotic decay modes. This presentation discusses several new results from these searches utilizing advanced online selection methods or analysis techniques with the entire Run 2 data.</description>

      <title>Theory of Majorana-Type Heavy Ion Double Charge Exchange Reactions by Pion--Nucleon Isotensor Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of heavy ion double charge exchange (DCE) reactions proceeding by effective rank-2 isotensor interactions is presented. Virtual pion--nucleon charge exchange interactions are investigated as the source for induced isotensor interactions, giving rise to the Majorana DCE (MDCE) reaction mechanism. MDCE is of a generic character, proceeding through pairs of complementary ($\pi^\pm,\pi^\mp$) reactions in the projectile and target nucleus. The dynamics of the elementary processes is discussed, where the excitation of pion--nucleon resonances are of central importance. Investigations of initial and final state ion--ion interactions show that these effects are acting as vertex renormalizations. In closure approximation, well justified by the finite pion mass, the second-order transition matrix elements reduce to pion potentials and effective two-body isotensor DCE interactions, giving rise also to two-body correlations in either of the participating nuclei. Connections to neutrinoless Majorana double beta decay (MDBD) are elucidated at various levels of the dynamics, from the underlying fundamental electro-weak and QCD scales to the physical scales of nuclear MDBD and MDCE physics. It is pointed out that heavy ion MDCE reactions may also proceed by competing electro-weak charge exchange processes, leading to lepton MDCE by electrons, positrons, and neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in the applications of quantum information science in astrophysical settings, especially for the neutrino transport in compact objects where three-flavors of neutrinos need to be mapped on qutrits, we review properties of one- and two-qudit systems. We contrast two-qubit and two-qudits systems by pointing out how some of the properties of two-qubit systems generalize to higher dimensions and explore emerging new properties for dimensions three or higher. One example is provided by the Werner states: when the density operator is written in the fundamental representation, we show that only two-qubit Werner states can be pure states, but not two-qudit Werner states when the qudit dimension is larger than two.</description>

      <title>Natural Inflation with Exponentially Small Tensor-To-Scalar Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that "natural inflation", also known as "axion inflation", can be compatible with Planck 2018 measurements of the cosmic microwave background, while predicting an exponentially small tensor-to-scalar ratio, e.g., $r\sim 10^{-15}$. The strong suppression of $r$ arises from dynamics of the radial component of the complex scalar field, whose phase is the axion. Such tiny values of $r$ remain well below the threshold for detection by CMB-S4 or Simons Observatory B-mode searches. The model is testable with the running $\alpha_s$ of the spectral index, which is within reach of next-generation CMB and large-scale structure experiments, motivating the running as a primary science goal for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting linear stability of black hole odd-parity perturbations in Einstein-Aether gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Einstein-Aether gravity, we revisit the issue of linear stabilities of black holes against odd-parity perturbations on a static and spherically symmetric background. In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.</description>

      <title>Impact of gauge fixing precision on the continuum limit of non-local quark-bilinear lattice operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the gauge fixing precision dependence of some non-local quark-blinear lattice operators interesting in computing parton physics for several measurements, using 5 lattice spacings ranging from 0.032 fm to 0.121 fm. Our results show that gauge dependent non-local measurements are significantly more sensitive to the precision of gauge fixing than anticipated. The impact of imprecise gauge fixing is significant for fine lattices and long distances. For instance, even with the typically defined precision of Landau gauge fixing of $10^{-8}$, the deviation caused by imprecise gauge fixing can reach 12 percent, when calculating the trace of Wilson lines at 1.2 fm with a lattice spacing of approximately 0.03 fm. Similar behavior has been observed in $\xi$ gauge and Coulomb gauge as well. For both quasi PDFs and quasi TMD-PDFs operators renormalized using the RI/MOM scheme, convergence for different lattice spacings at long distance is only observed when the precision of Landau gauge fixing is sufficiently high. To describe these findings quantitatively, we propose an empirical formula to estimate the required precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compile a \emph{Fermi} sample of the \emph{long} GRBs from \emph{Fermi} observations with 15 years of the Fermi-GBM catalogue with identified redshift, in which the GOLD sample contains 123 long GRBs at $z\le5.6$ and the FULL sample contains 151 long GRBs with redshifts at $z\le8.2$. The Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p,i}$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation) are calibrated at $z&lt;1.4$ by a Gaussian Process from the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) with the cosmic chronometers method to obtain GRBs at high-redshift $z\ge1.4$ which can be used to constrain cosmological models via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. With the cosmology-independent GRBs with the GOLD sample at $z\ge1.4$ and the Pantheon sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at $0.01&lt;z\leq2.3$, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.354\pm0.018, H_0 = 73.05\pm0.002$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model; $w_0 = -1.22^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$ for the flat $w$CDM model; and $w_{a} = -1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.83}$ for the flat Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level. Our results with the GOLD and FULL sample are almost identical, which are more stringent than the previous results with GRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last few decades have provided abundant evidence for physics beyond the two standard models of particle physics and cosmology. As is now known, the by far largest part of our universe's matter/energy content lies in the `dark' and consists of dark energy and dark matter. Despite intensive efforts on the experimental as well as the theoretical side, the origins of both are still completely unknown. Screened scalar fields have been hypothesized as potential candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Among these, some of the most prominent models are the chameleon, symmetron, and environment-dependent dilaton. In this article, we present a summary containing the most recent experimental constraints on the parameters of these three models. For this, experimental results have been employed from the qBOUNCE collaboration, neutron interferometry, and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR), among others. In addition, constraints are forecast for the Casimir And Non Newtonian force EXperiment (CANNEX). Combining these results with previous ones, this article collects the most up-to-date constraints on the three considered screened scalar field models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting scientific understanding from particle-physics experiments requires solving diverse learning problems with high precision and good data efficiency. We propose the Lorentz Geometric Algebra Transformer (L-GATr), a new multi-purpose architecture for high-energy physics. L-GATr represents high-energy data in a geometric algebra over four-dimensional space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations, the symmetry group of relativistic kinematics. At the same time, the architecture is a Transformer, which makes it versatile and scalable to large systems. L-GATr is first demonstrated on regression and classification tasks from particle physics. We then construct the first Lorentz-equivariant generative model: a continuous normalizing flow based on an L-GATr network, trained with Riemannian flow matching. Across our experiments, L-GATr is on par with or outperforms strong domain-specific baselines.</description>

      <title>New limits on neutrino decay from high-energy astrophysical neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since neutrinos have mass differences, they could decay into one another. But their lifetimes are likely long, even when shortened by new physics, so decay likely impacts neutrinos only during long trips. This makes high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, traveling for up to billions of light-years, sensitive probes of decay. However, their sensitivity must be tempered by reality. We derive from them thorough bounds on the neutrino lifetimes accounting for critical astrophysical unknowns and the nuances of neutrino detection. Using the diffuse neutrino flux, we disfavor lifetimes $\tau \lesssim 20$-450 s $(m/{\rm eV})$, based on present IceCube data, and forecast factor-of-10 improvements by upcoming detectors. Using, for the first time, neutrinos from the active galaxy NGC 1068, extant unknowns preclude placing lifetime bounds today, but upcoming detectors could disfavor $\tau \sim 100$-5000 s $(m/{\rm eV})$.</description>

Abstract: The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. We comment on higher dimensional cases for which we argue that in generic situations the replica wormhole configuration is off-shell due to the Witten-Yau theorem. This necessitates the inclusion of smooth constrained saddles into the gravitational path integral for appropriate questions.</description>

Abstract: The soft emission factor is a central ingredient in the factorization of generic $n$-particle gauge theory amplitudes with one soft gluon in the external state. We present the complete two-loop soft factor, capturing the leading power behavior in the soft-gluon momentum. At two loops, the color structure and the kinematic dependence of the soft factor become nontrivial as the soft gluon can couple to three hard partons for the first time (tripole terms). The nontrivial kinematic dependence of the tripole terms is of uniform, maximal transcendental weight, and can be expressed (in a "Euclidean" region) in terms of single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. Our results are consistent with the behavior of the recently computed symbol of the two-loop five-particle amplitude in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. In the limit where the outgoing soft gluon is also collinear with an incoming hard parton, potentially dangerous factorization-violating terms can arise, but they cancel after summing over colors.</description>

      <title>Understanding parton evolution in matter from renormalization group analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a renormalization group (RG) analysis of collinear hadron production in deep inelastic scattering on nuclei. We consider the limit where the parent parton energy $E$ is large, while the medium opacity $L/\lambda_g$ remains small. We identify the fixed order and leading $\ln(E/\xi^2 L)$ enhanced medium contributions to the semi-inclusive cross sections and derive RG equations that resum multiple emissions near the endpoints of the splitting functions at first order in opacity. These evolution equations treat the same type of radiation enhancement in matter as the modified Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi approach, but differ in the way one regulates the collinear divergences. They provide a unique analytic insight into the problem of resummation and a faster and more efficient path to phenomenology. The new RG evolution framework is applied to study fragmentation in $e$A reactions.</description>

      <title>Improving NLO QCD event generators with high-energy EW corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present a new approach for the combination of electroweak (EW) corrections at high energies, the so-called EW Sudakov logarithms (EWSL), and next-to-leading-order QCD predictions matched to parton-shower simulations (NLO+PS). Our approach is based on a reweighting procedure of NLO+PS events. In particular, both events with and without an extra hard emission from matrix elements are consistently reweighted via the inclusion of the corresponding EWSL contribution. We describe the technical details and the implementation in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. Via a completely automated procedure, events at this new level of accuracy can be obtained for a vast class of hadroproduction processes. As a byproduct we provide results for phenomenologically relevant physical distributions from top-quark pair and Higgs boson associated production ($t\overline{t}H$) and from the associated production of three $Z$ gauge bosons ($ZZZ$).</description>

      <title>The automation of SMEFT-Assisted Constraints on UV-Complete Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ongoing Effective Field Theory (EFT) program at the LHC and elsewhere is motivated by streamlining the connection between experimental data and UV-complete scenarios of heavy new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This connection is provided by matching relations mapping the Wilson coefficients of the EFT to the couplings and masses of UV-complete models. Building upon recent work on the automation of tree-level and one-loop matching in the SMEFT, we present a novel strategy automating the constraint-setting procedure on the parameter space of general heavy UV-models matched to dimension-six SMEFT operators. A new Mathematica package, match2fit, interfaces Matchmakereft, which derives the matching relations for a given UV model, and SMEFiT, which provides bounds on the Wilson coefficients by comparing with data. By means of this pipeline and using both tree-level and one-loop matching, we derive bounds on a wide range of single- and multi-particle extensions of the SM from a global dataset composed by LHC and LEP measurements. Whenever possible, we benchmark our results with existing studies. Our framework realises one of the main objectives of the EFT program in particle physics: deploying the SMEFT to bypass the need of directly comparing the predictions of heavy UV models with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Heavy neutral leptons from kaons in effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the low-energy effective theory containing in addition to the Standard Model fields heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), we compute the decay rates of neutral and charged kaons into HNLs. We consider both lepton-number-conserving and lepton-number-violating four-fermion operators, taking into account also the contribution of active-heavy neutrino mixing. Assuming that the produced HNLs are long-lived, we perform simulations and calculate the sensitivities of future long-lived-particle (LLP) detectors at the high-luminosity LHC as well as the near detector of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE-ND) to the considered scenario. When applicable, we also recast the existing bounds on the minimal mixing case obtained by NA62, T2K, and PS191. Our findings show that while the future LHC LLP detectors can probe currently allowed parameter space only in certain benchmark scenarios, DUNE-ND should be sensitive to parameter space beyond the current bounds in almost all the benchmark scenarios and for some of the effective operators considered it can even probe new-physics scales in excess of 3000 TeV.</description>

      <title>New Directions for ALP Searches Combining Nuclear Reactors and Haloscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose reactoscope, a novel experimental setup for axion-like particle (ALP) searches. Nuclear reactors produce a copious number of photons, a fraction of which could convert into ALPs via Primakoff process in the reactor core. The generated flux of ALPs leaves the nuclear power plant and its passage through a region with a strong magnetic field results in the efficient conversion to photons which can be detected. Such magnetic field is the key component of axion haloscope experiments. Adjacent nuclear reactor and axion haloscope experiment exist in Grenoble, France. There, the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) research reactor is situated only $\sim 700$ m from GrAHal, the axion haloscope platform designed to offer several volume and magnetic field (up to 43 T) configurations. We derive sensitivity projections for photophilic ALP searches with ILL and GrAHal, and also scrutinize analogous realizations, such as the one comprising of CAST experiment at CERN and Bugey nuclear power plant. The results that we obtain complement and extend the reach of existing laboratory experiments, e.g. light-shining-through-walls. While the derived sensitivities are not competitive when compared to the astrophysical limits, our analysis is free from the assumptions associated to those.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exclusive $J/\psi$ production at the future Electron-ion collider in China by utilizing the eSTARlight event generator. We model the cross-section and kinematics by fitting to the world data of $J/\psi$ photoproduction. Projected statistical uncertainties on $J/\psi$ production are based on the design of a central detector, which consists of a tracker and vertex subsystem. The precision of the pseudo-data allows us to probe the near-threshold mechanism, e.g. the re-scattering effect. The significance of the forward amplitudes is discussed as well. The design and optimization of the detector enhance the potential for exploring the near-threshold region and the realm of high four-momentum transfer squared, which is of particular interest on several physics topics..</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stable dark matter particles may arise as pseudo-Goldstone bosons from the confinement of dark quarks interacting via a non-Abelian gauge force. Their relic abundance is determined not by annihilations into visible particles but by dark pion number-changing processes within the dark sector, such as $3 \pi_D \to 2 \pi_D$. However, if the dark vector mesons $\rho_D$ are light enough for $3 \pi_D \to \pi_D \rho_D$ annihilations to be kinematically allowed, this process dominates and significantly delays freeze-out. As a result, the preferred dark matter mass scale increases and bounds from the Bullet Cluster can be evaded.</description>

We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermal Relic Right-Handed Neutrino Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that two heavy Majorana right-handed neutrinos are sufficient to generate the baryon asymmetry in the present universe. Thus, it is interesting to identify the third right-handed neutrino $N$ with the dark matter. We impose a new discrete symmetry $Z_2$ on this dark matter neutrino to stabilize it. However, the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson $A'$ couples to the right-handed neutrino $N$. If the $B-L$ breaking scale $V_{B-L}$ is sufficiently low, the dark matter neutrino $N$ can be in the thermal bath. We find that the thermal relic $N$ can explain the dark matter abundance for the $B-L$ breaking scale $ V_{B-L} \sim O(10)\,$TeV. After considering all the constraints from the existing experiments, a narrow mass region of the thermal produced right-handed neutrino dark matter $N$ is still surviving.</description>

      <title>Single production of an exotic vector-like $Y$ quark at future high energy $pp$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector-like quarks have been predicted in various new physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM). In a simplified modelling of a $(B,Y)$ doublet including a vector-like quark $Y$, with charge $-\frac{4}{3}$e, there are only two free parameters: the $Y$ coupling $\kappa_{Y}$ and mass $m_Y$. In the five flavor scheme, we investigate the single production of the $Y$ state decaying into $Wb$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run-III and High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operating at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, the possible High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) with $\sqrt{s}$ = 27 TeV as well as the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh) with $\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV. Through detailed signal-to-background analyses and detector simulations, we assess the exclusion capabilities of the $Y$ state at the different colliders. We find that this can be improved significantly with increasing collision energy, especially at the HE-LHC and FCC-hh, both demonstrating an obvious advantage with respect to the HL-LHC in the case of high $m_Y$. Assuming a 10\% systematic uncertainty on the background event rate, the exclusion capabilities are summarized as follows: (1) the LHC Run-III can exclude the correlated regions of $\kappa_{Y} \in [0.06,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \in [1500\text{ GeV},3800\text{ GeV}]$ with integrated luminosity $L = 300\text{ fb}^{-1}$; (2) the HL-LHC can exclude the correlated regions of $\kappa_{Y} \in [0.05,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \in [1500\text{ GeV},3970\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$; (3) the HE-LHC can exclude the correlated regions of $\kappa_Y \in [0.06,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \in [1500\text{ GeV} , 6090\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$; (4) the FCC-hh can exclude the correlated regions of $\kappa_{Y} \in [0.08,0.5]$ and $m_{Y} \in [1500\text{ GeV} , 10080\text{ GeV}]$ with $L = 3$ ab$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: We search for indirect signals of $\mathscr{O}$(keV) dark matter annihilating or decaying into $\mathscr{O}$(eV) dark photons. These dark photons will be highly boosted and have decay lengths larger than the Milky Way, and can be absorbed by neutrino or dark matter experiments at a rate dependent on the photon-dark photon kinetic mixing parameter and the optical properties of the experiment. We show that current experiments can not probe new parameter space, but future large-scale gaseous detectors with low backgrounds (i.e. CYGNUS, NEXT, PANDAX-III) may be sensitive to this signal when the annihilation cross section is especially large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple setup which can stabilize a modulus field of the finite modular symmetry by the Coleman-Weinberg potential. Our scenario leads to a large hierarchy suppressing instanton-like corrections $e^{2\pi i\tau}$ and to a light axion identified as $\mathrm{Re} \tau$, where $\tau$ is the modulus field. This stabilization mechanism provides the axion solution to the strong CP problem. The potential has a minimum at a large $\mathrm{Im}\tau$ which suppresses explicit $U(1)_{\mathrm{PQ}}$ violation terms proportional to $e^{-2\pi {\mathrm{Im}\tau}}$, and hence the quality of the axion is ensured by the residual symmetry associated with the $T$-transformation, $\tau \to \tau +1$, around the fixed point $\tau \sim i\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Kondo effect for a single heavy quark in quark matter composed of light quarks with chiral symmetry breaking. Introducing several spinor structures in QCD Kondo condensates, i.e., particle-projected condensate, antiparticle-projected condensate, and normal condensate without projection, we calculate the attractive energy gained by the heavy quark within the mean-field approximation in the path-integral formalism. We show that the normal condensate is favored at low density and the particle-projected condensate is favored at high density, when the light quark has a nonzero mass. We interpret such a density-dependent transition between the two condensates in terms of the Kondo resonances.</description>

      <title>Constraints on new physics with (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New physics contributions to the (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering process can be constrained by precision measurements, with controlled Standard Model uncertainties. In a large class of new physics models, interactions involving charged leptons of different flavor can be related, and the large muon flavor component of accelerator neutrino beams can mitigate the lepton mass suppression that occurs in other low-energy measurements. We employ the recent high-statistics measurement of the cross section for $\bar{\nu}_\mu p \to \mu^+ n$ scattering on the hydrogen atom by MINERvA to place new confidence intervals on tensor and scalar neutrino-nucleon interactions: $\mathfrak{Re} C_T = -1^{+14}_{-13} \times 10^{-4}$, $|\mathfrak{Im} C_T| \le 1.3 \times 10^{-3}$, and $|\mathfrak{Im} C_S| = 45^{+13}_{-19} \times 10^{-3}$. These results represent a reduction in uncertainty by a factor of $2.1$, $3.1$, and $1.2$, respectively, compared to existing constraints from precision beta decay.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis consequences of trimaximal mixing and $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry in the most minimal seesaw model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14441v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the realizations of the popular TM1 neutrino mixing and neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which are well motivated from the neutrino oscillation data and lead to interesting phenomenological consequences) in the most minimal seesaw model with a pseudo-Dirac pair of right-handed neutrinos, and their consequences for leptogenesis. In order to realize the low-scale resonant leptogenesis scenario, we have considered two possible ways of generating the tiny mass splitting between the two right-handed neutrinos: one way is to modify their Majorana mass matrix to a form as shown in Eq. (25); the other way is to consider the renormalization-group corrections for their masses. For the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, in order for leptogenesis to work, we have further considered the flavor-dependent conversion efficiencies from the lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry during the sphaleron processes, and its breaking via the renormalization-group corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We forecast high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) from preheating hosting gravitational dark matter (GDM) as the indirect probe of such GDM. We use proper lattice simulations to handle resonance, and to solve GW equation of motion with the resonance induced scalar field excitations as source term. Our numerical results show that Higgs scalar excitations in Higgs preheating model give rise to magnitudes of GW energy density spectra of order $10^{-10}$ at frequencies $10-10^{3}$ MHz depending on the GDM mass, whereas inflaton fluctuation excitations in inflaton self-resonant preheating model yield magnitudes of GW energy density spectrum up to $10^{-9}~(10^{-11})$ at frequencies near $30~(2)$ MHz for the index $n=4~(6)$ with respect to the GDM mass of $1.04~(2.66)\times 10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>PeV-Scale SUSY and Cosmic Strings from F-term Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider F-term hybrid inflation (FHI) and SUSY breaking in the context of a B-L extension of MSSM which largely respects a global U(1) R symmetry. The hidden sector Kaehler manifold enjoys an enhanced SU(1,1)/U(1) symmetry with the scalar curvature determined by the achievement of a SUSY-breaking de Sitter vacuum without ugly tuning. FHI turns out to be consistent with data, provided that the magnitude of the emergent soft tadpole term is confined in the range (1.2-100) TeV, and it is accompanied with the production of B-L cosmic strings. If these are metastable they interpret the present observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with dimensionless tension Gmu~(1-9.2)x10^-8. The mu parameter of MSSM arises by appropriately adapting the Giudice-Masiero mechanism and facilitates the out-of-equilibrium decay of the R saxion at a reheat temperature lower than about 71 GeV. Due to the prolonged matter dominated era the gravitational wave signal is suppressed at high frequencies. The SUSY mass scale turns out to lie in the PeV region.</description>

Abstract: How to describe loop corrections is a fundamental challenge in the quantization of Einstein gravity. In this paper, we give it a try in UV-free scheme, and the result seems to be effective for graviton loops. This indicates that both loops of the renormalizable Standard Model and the non-renormalizable Einstein gravity can be described by the method of UV-free scheme.</description>

      <title>Image Classification in High-Energy Physics: A Comprehensive Survey of Applications to Jet Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the fields of high-energy physics (HEP) in its both parts experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using different DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics of various particle physics types and sets up guidelines for assessing particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed classification is provided for representing the jet images that are reconstructed in high energy collisions mainly with proton-proton collisions at well defined beam energies, covering various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HLC) such as high luminosity LHC (HL-HLC) and future circular collider-hadron-hadron (FCC-hh). Next, the authors explore a number of AI models analysis designed specifically for images in HEP. We additionally undertake a closer look at the classification associated with images in hadron collisions, with an emphasis on Jets. In this review, we look into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL, examining their implications for HEP demands. More precisely, this discussion tackles various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes with an analysis of the current state of HEP, using DL methodologies. It covers the challenges and potential areas for future research that will be illustrated for each application.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the next-to-leading-power $\gamma\gamma \to h $ and $gg\to h$ soft quark functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate directly in position space the one-loop renormalization kernels of the soft operators $O_\gamma$ and $O_g$ that appear in the soft-quark contributions to, respectively, the subleading-power $\gamma\gamma\to h$ and $gg\to h$ form factors mediated by the $b$-quark. We present an IR/rapidity divergence-free definition for $O_g$ and demonstrate that with a correspondent definition of the collinear function, a consistent factorization theorem is recovered. Using conformal symmetry techniques, we establish a relation between the evolution kernels of the leading-twist heavy-light light-ray operator, whose matrix element defines the $B$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), and $O_\gamma$ to all orders in perturbation theory. Application of this relation allows us to bootstrap the kernel of $O_\gamma$ to the two-loop level. We construct an ansatz for the kernel of $O_g$ at higher orders. We test this ansatz against the consistency requirement at two-loop and find they differ only by a particular constant.</description>

      <title>Semi-leptonic $W$ decay to $B$ meson with lepton pairs in HQET factorization upto $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of heavy-light meson production within the framework of heavy quark effective theory (HQET) factorization, we extend the factorization formalism for rather a complicated process $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ in the limit of non-zero invariant squared-mass of dilepton, $q^2$, at the lowest order in $1/m_b$ up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$. The purpose of the current study is to extend the HQET factorization formula for the $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process and subsequently compute the form factors for this channel up to next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections in $\alpha_s$. We explicitly show the amplitude of the $W^+\to B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process can also be factorized into a convolution between the perturbatively calculable hard-scattering kernel and the non-perturbative yet universal light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) defined in HQET. The validity of HQET factorization depends on the assumed scale hierarchy $m_W \sim m_b \gg \Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$. Within the HQET framework, we evaluate the form factors associated with the $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ process, providing insights into its phenomenology. In addition, we also perform an exploratory phenomenological study on $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ by employing an exponential model for the LCDAs for $B^+$ meson. Our findings reveal that the branching ratio for $W^+ \rightarrow B^+\ell^+\ell^-$ is below $10^{-10}$. Although the branching ratios are small, this channel in high luminosity LHC experiments may serve to further constraints the value of $\lambda_B$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Four Fermion Contact Couplings of a Dark Fermion and an Electron at Hadron Colliders and Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both the collider searches and direct detections are promising approaches to probe a fermionic dark matter. In this paper we study signatures of the four fermion contact operators involving a dark fermion, an electron and a quark pair. We show that the mono-electron production channel at hadron collider can provide strong constraints. Associated productions of a charged electron with a photon/jet with missing energy are also studied. Using the current LHC data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$\,TeV, the lower bound on the energy scale of the (axial-)vector operator can reach to $12$\,TeV for a massless dark fermion. It can be further improved to about $24$\,TeV at the HE-LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 25$\,TeV and a total luminosity $20\,{\rm ab}^{-1}$. For the direct detections, the signal operators can generate induced $\beta^\pm$ decays. For the induced $\beta^-$ decay, we show that the constraints are weaker than the ones from the collider searches in almost all of the parameter space, and the accessible parameter space is already excluded by the current LHC data. In case of a relative heavy dark fermion (a few MeV), the induced $\beta^+$ decay is more sensitive than the collider search. Despite the advantage of the collider search that a much wider range of the dark fermion mass can be investigated, it can also provide a complementarity to the detect detections.</description>

      <title>The non-perturbative Sudakov Form Factor and the role of soft gluons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of soft gluons in inclusive collinear parton densities as well as in Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton densities is discussed. Applying the Parton-Branching (PBM) method, the so-called non-perturbative Sudakov form factor could be identified with the integration range $z \to 1$, which is neglected in collinear parton shower approaches.
  The importance of soft gluons could be shown by investigating the transverse momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs, leading to a width of the intrinsic-$k_T$ distribution which is independent on $\sqrt{s}$ , in contrast to what is observed in parton shower approaches. The reason for this behavior is traced back to the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor. The role of soft gluons for observable hadron spectra is discussed and shown to be negligible.

      <title>String-based parametrization of nucleon GPDs at any skewness: a comparison to lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a string-based parametrization for nucleon quark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) effective across all skewness values. The conformal moments of the GPDs are expressed as sums of the spin-j nucleon A-form factor, and the skewness-dependent spin-j nucleon D-form factor. This representation, which fulfills the polynomiality condition and does not rely on model-specific assumptions, is derived from t-channel string exchanges in AdS spaces. The spin-j nucleon D-form factor is closely related to the the spin-j nucleon A-form factor. We use the Mellin moments from empirical parton distributions to model the spin-j nucleon A-form factors. Using only five Regge slope parameters, fixed from the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, our string-based parametrization generates accurate singlet, non-singlet, isovector, and flavor-separated nucleon quark GPDs, along with symmetric nucleon gluon GPDs from their Mellin-Barnes integral representations. Our isovector nucleon quark GPD is in agreement with existing lattice data. Our string-based parametrization should enhance the empirical extraction and global analysis of nucleon GPDs in exclusive processes, bypassing the de-convolution problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the holographic model, which incorporates the equation of state (EoS) and baryon number susceptibility for different flavors, we calculate the drag force, jet quenching parameter, and diffusion coefficient of the heavy quark at finite temperature and chemical potential. The holographic results for the diffusion coefficient align with lattice data for $N_f = 0$ and $N_f = 2+1$, falling within their error margins. The holographic diffusion coefficient for heavy quark in the systems of different flavors agrees with the fitting results of ALICE data well. The jet quenching parameter in our model demonstrates strong consistency with the results from both RHIC and LHC for different flavors. By comparing the experimental data with other models, we can confirm the validity of our holographic model calculation. The work reinforces the potential of bottom-up holographic model in advancing our understanding of transport properties of hot and dense quark-gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the properties and physical phase of the dense strongly interacting matter present in the cores of neutron stars or created in their binary mergers remains one of the most prominent open problems in nuclear astrophysics. While most microscopic analyses have historically relied on solvable phenomenological models of nuclear and quark matter, in recent years a model-independent approach utilizing only controlled ab-initio calculations and astrophysical observations has emerged as a viable alternative.
  In these lecture notes, I review recent progress in first-principles weak-coupling calculations within high-density quark matter, shedding light on its thermodynamic and transport properties. I cover the most important technical tools used in such calculations, introduce selected highlight results, and explain how this information can be used in phenomenological studies of neutron-star physics. The notes do not offer a self-consistent treatment of the topics covered, but rather aim at filling gaps in existing textbooks on thermal field theory and at connecting the dots in a story developed in several recent research articles, to which the interested reader is directed for further technical details.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational positivity bounds provide consistency conditions for effective field theories with gravity. They turn out to be phenomenologically useful by providing lower bounds in parameters of new physics beyond the Standard Models (BSM). In this paper, we derive constraints on millicharged fermion dark matter models with massless dark photon using gravitational positivity bounds. Combining them with upper bounds from cosmological and astrophysical observations, we can severely constrain the parameter space of the model. In particular, we show that when the dark matter mass is lighter than the solar core temperature, most of the parameter region is excluded by combining gravitational positivity bounds and the stellar bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve successful hilltop inflation in which the inflaton is identified as the modulus field in a modular invariant theory. The dilaton plays a crucial role in shaping the potential. Modular invariant gaugino condensation provides the mechanism for the modulus stabilisation after inflation. The inflationary trajectory lies on the lower boundary of the fundamental domain of the modulus field $\tau$. Inflation starts near the fixed point $\tau ={\rm i}$, and ends at a point near $\tau = \omega$, which is the global de Sitter vacuum. We investigate the allowed parameter space for successful modular invariant hilltop inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start from a recently favored picture in which the $\Lambda_c(2940)$ and $\Lambda_c(2910)$ correspond mostly to $ND^*$ bound states with $J^P = 1/2^-,\, 3/2^-$ and then add a $D$ as a third particle, looking for the possible binding of the $DND^*$ three body system within the framework of the Fixed Center Approximation. We find that the system is bound with respect to the corresponding $\Lambda_c^* D$ threshold with a binding of about $60$ MeV and a width of about $90$ MeV. Alternatively we assume a cluster of $ND$ and a $D^*$ meson interacting with the cluster and we find similar results. The observation of these states of $J^P = 1/2^+,\, 3/2^+$ would provide new and valuable information concerning the $DN$ and $D^* N$ interaction, an issue of current debate.</description>

Since neutrinos and photons have the same geodesic equation around black holes, we can estimate the radius where the neutrinos will be released by obtaining a series of trajectory curves with various correction values $\xi$. The black hole shadow radius is influenced by the correction parameter $\xi$. The black hole shadow radius decreases with increasing the $\xi$. The ratio $\dfrac{\dot{Q}}{\dot{Q}_{Newt}}$ corresponding to the energy deposition per unit time over that in the Newtonian case is derived and calculated. We find that the quantum corrections to the black hole spacetime affect the emitted energy rate ratio for the annihilation. It is interesting that the more considerable quantum effect reduces the ratio value slightly. Although the energy conversion is damped because of the quantum correction, the energy deposition rate is enough during the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation. The corrected annihilation process can become a source of gamma ray burst. We also investigate the derivative $\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\dot{Q}}{\mathrm{d}r}$ relating to the star's radius $r$ to show that the quantum effect for the black hole will drop the ratio. The more manifest quantum gravity influence leads the weaker neutrino pair annihilation.</description>

      <title>Wilson Loop Duality and OPE for Super Form Factors of Half-BPS Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dual Wilson loop description for the MHV super form factors of half-BPS operators in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. In this description, the local operators are represented by on-shell states, made out of zero-momentum particles, that are absorbed by a null periodic super Wilson loop. We present evidence for this duality at weak coupling, by performing an explicit calculation of the Wilson loop matrix elements through one loop. At tree level, the interactions localize at the cusps of the loop, revealing a simple connection between the super form factors and the $m=2$ tree amplituhedron. At loop level, we show that the Wilson loop calculation reproduces the known results for the super form factors. Inspired by this duality, we extend the OPE program developed for the form factors of the Lagrangian to the super form factors of the higher-charge operators. We introduce non-perturbative axioms and conjectures for the main building blocks that govern the exchange of the lightest flux-tube excitations. These blocks appear as simple refinements of the form factor transitions introduced in earlier OPE studies. They are expressed at any value of the 't Hooft coupling in terms of the tilted Beisert-Eden-Staudacher kernel. We carry out checks of our conjectures up to two loops at weak coupling for three- and four-point form factors of half-BPS operators of various lengths, finding perfect agreement with perturbative data.</description>

Abstract: Complexity will be more and more essential in high-energy physics. It is naturally extended into the very early universe. Considering the universe as a quantum chaotic system, the curvature perturbation of the scalar field is identified with the two-mode squeezed state. By solving the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation, one can obtain the numerical solutions of the angle parameter and squeezing parameter. The solution of the squeezing parameter mainly determines the evolution of complexity. Our numeric indicates that the complexity of the modified dispersion relation will have a non-linear pattern after the horizon exits. Meanwhile, its corresponding Lyapunov index is also larger compared with the standard case. During the inflationary period, the complexity will irregularly oscillate and its scrambling time is also shorter compared with the standard case. Since the modified dispersion relation can be dubbed as the consequences of various frameworks of quantum gravity, it could be applicable to these frameworks. Finally, one can expect the framework of quantum gravity will lead to the fruitful evolution of complexity, which guides us in distinguishing various inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Production of doubly charmed hadron $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $T_{cc}^+$ in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity for studying the properties of exotic hadrons with two charm quarks. The production of $T_{cc}^+$ is significantly enhanced in nuclear collisions compared to proton-proton collisions due to the creation of multiple charm pairs. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation in combination with the Instantaneous Coalescence Model (LICM) to investigate the production of $T_{cc}^+$ and $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ which consists of two charm quarks. We consider $T_{cc}^+$ as molecular states composed of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The Langevin equation is used to calculate the energy loss of charm quarks and $D$ mesons in the hot medium. The hadronization process, where charm quarks transform into each $D$ state as constituents of $T_{cc}^+$ production, is described using the coalescence model. The coalescence probability between $D$ and $D^*$ is determined by the Wigner function, which encodes the information of the $T_{cc}^+$ wave function. Our results show that the $T_{cc}^+$ production varies by approximately one order of magnitude when different widths in the Wigner function, representing distinct binding energies of $T_{cc}^+$, are considered. This variation offers valuable insights into the nature of $T_{cc}^+$ through the analysis of its wave function. The $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ is treated as a hadronic state produced at the hadronization of the deconfined matter. Its production is also calculated as a comparison with the molecular state $T_{cc}^+$.</description>

      <title>Fate of Chiral Symmetries in the Quark-Gluon Plasma from an Instanton-Based Random Matrix Model of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way of understanding how chiral symmetry is realized in the high temperature phase of QCD. Based on the finding that a simple free instanton gas precisely describes the details of the lowest part of the spectrum of the lattice overlap Dirac operator, we propose an instanton-based random matrix model of QCD with dynamical quarks. Simulations of this model reveal that even for small quark mass the Dirac spectral density has a singularity at the origin, caused by a dilute gas of free instantons. Even though the interaction, mediated by light dynamical quarks creates small instanton-antiinstanton molecules, those do not influence the singular part of the spectrum, and this singular part is shown to dominate Banks-Casher type sums in the chiral limit. By generalizing the Banks-Casher formula for the singular spectrum, we show that in the chiral limit the chiral condensate vanishes if there are at least two massless flavors. Our model also indicates a possible way of resolving a long-standing debate, as it suggests that for two massless quark flavors the $U(1)_{A}$ symmetry is likely to remain broken up to arbitrarily high finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in dark matter superfluids: The evolution of black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of superfluid dark matter is characterized by self-interacting sub-eV particles that thermalize and condense to form a superfluid core in galaxies. Massive black holes at the center of galaxies, however, modify the dark matter distribution and result in a density enhancement in their vicinity known as dark matter spikes. The presence of these spikes affects the evolution of binary systems by modifying their gravitational wave emission and inducing dynamical friction effects on the orbiting bodies. In this work, we assess the role of dynamical friction for bodies moving through a superfluid core enhanced by a central massive black hole. As a first step, we compute the dynamical friction force experienced by bodies moving in a circular orbit. Then, we estimate the gravitational wave dephasing of the binary, showing that the effect of the superfluid drag force is beyond the reach of space-based experiments like LISA, contrarily to collisionless dark matter, therefore providing an opportunity to distinguish these dark matter models.</description>

      <title>A Comparison Between Invariant and Equivariant Classical and Quantum Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis, greatly motivate the development of alternative fast and efficient computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, one can leverage the fundamental symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and equivariant layers. In this paper, we perform a fair and comprehensive comparison between classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their AUC scores, the quantum networks were shown to outperform the classical networks. However, seeing the computational advantage of the quantum networks in practice may have to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated APIs.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Image Blurring from Transversely Correlated Quantum Gravity Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in spacetime can, in some cases, lead to distortion in astronomical images of faraway objects. In particular, a stochastic model of quantum gravity predicts an accumulated fluctuation in the path length $\Delta L$ with variance $\langle \Delta L^2\rangle\sim l_pL$ over a distance $L$, similar to a random walk, and assuming no spatial correlation above length $l_p$; it has been argued that such an effect is ruled out by observation of sharp images from distant stars. However, in other theories, such as the pixellon (modeled on the Verlinde-Zurek (VZ) effect), quantum fluctuations can still accumulate as in the random walk model while simultaneously having large distance correlations in the fluctuations. Using renormalization by analytic continuation, we derive the correlation transverse to the light propagation, and show that image distortion effects in the pixellon model are strongly suppressed in comparison to the random walk model, thus evading all existing and future constraints. We also find that the diffraction of light rays does not lead to qualitative changes in the blurring effect.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the stochastic QCD axion window: departure from equilibrium during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If dark matter is made of QCD axions, its abundance is determined by the vacuum expectation value acquired by the axion field during inflation. The axion is usually assumed to follow the equilibrium distribution arising from quantum diffusion during inflation. This leads to the so-called stochastic window under which the QCD axion can make up all the dark matter. It is characterised by $10^{10.4}\mathrm{GeV}\leq f\leq 10^{17.2}\mathrm{GeV}$ and $H_{\mathrm{end}}&gt;10^{-2.2}\mathrm{GeV}$, where $f$ is the axion decay constant and $H_{\mathrm{end}}$ is the Hubble expansion rate at the end of inflation. However, in realistic inflationary potentials, we show that the axion never reaches the equilibrium distribution at the end of inflation. This is because the relaxation time of the axion is much larger than the typical time scale over which $H$ varies during inflation. As a consequence, the axion acquires a quasi-flat distribution as long as it remains light during inflation. This leads us to reassessing the stochastic axion window, and we find that $ 10^{10.3}\mathrm{GeV}\leq f\leq 10^{14.1}\mathrm{GeV}$ and $H_{\mathrm{end}}&gt;10^{-13.8}\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>A double take on early and interacting dark energy from JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The very first light captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a population of galaxies at very high redshifts more massive than expected in the canonical $\Lambda$CDM model of structure formation. Barring, among others, a systematic origin of the issue, in this paper, we test alternative cosmological perturbation histories. We argue that models with a larger matter component $\Omega_m$ and/or a larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ can substantially improve the fit to JWST measurements. In this regard, phenomenological extensions related to the dark energy sector of the theory are appealing alternatives, with Early Dark Energy emerging as an excellent candidate to explain (at least in part) the unexpected JWST preference for larger stellar mass densities. Conversely, Interacting Dark Energy models, despite producing higher values of matter clustering parameters such as $\sigma_8$, are generally disfavored by JWST measurements. This is due to the energy-momentum flow from the dark matter to the dark energy sector, implying a smaller matter energy density. Upcoming observations may either strengthen the evidence or falsify some of these appealing phenomenological alternatives to the simplest $\Lambda$CDM picture.</description>

Abstract: Throughout the cosmic history, primordial black holes may experience an efficient phase of baryonic mass accretion from the surrounding medium. While the realm of accretion physics is marked by numerous uncertainties, and a comprehensive understanding remains elusive, recent investigations have delved into this area, exploring its implications for the cosmological evolution of these compact objects. Notably, primordial black holes could experience characteristic growths of their masses and spins, accompanied by the emission of radiation, ultimately responsible for feedback effects that could weaken the efficiency of the process. In this chapter we review the basic formalism to describe the accretion rate, luminosity function and feedback effects, in order to provide distinctive predictions for the evolution of the primordial black hole mass and spin parameters.</description>

      <title>Saturation of nuclear matter in the relativistic Brueckner Hatree-Fock approach with a leading order covariant chiral nuclear force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear saturation is a crucial feature in nuclear physics that plays a fundamental role in understanding various nuclear phenomena, ranging from properties of finite nuclei to those of neutron stars. However, a proper description of nuclear saturation is highly nontrivial in modern nonrelativistic~\textit{ab initio}~studies because of the elusive three-body forces. In this letter, we calculate the equation of state for nuclear matter in the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) framework with the leading order covariant chiral nuclear force. We show that a simultaneous description of the nucleon-nucleon scattering data and the saturation of the symmetric nuclear matter can be achieved. In this regard, the relativistic effects nicely explain the saturation of nuclear matter. As a result, the present study based on the covariant chiral nuclear force shows that in the RBHF framework, one can achieve saturation with a leading order covariant chiral nuclear force with only two-body forces, in contrast to the vast majorities of studies in the non-relativistic framework, where the next-to-next-to-leading order two-body and three-body chiral forces are needed. This study sets the foundation for studying nuclear saturation with the covariant chiral force in the RBHF framework, which allows for a systematic understanding of one of the key features of nuclear physics more microscopically.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have systematically investigated the Krylov complexity of curvature perturbation for the modified dispersion relation in inflation, using the algorithm in closed system and open system. Our analysis could be applied to the most inflationary models. Following the Lanczos algorithm, we find the very early universe is an infinite, many-body, and maximal chaotic system. Our numerics shows that the Lanczos coefficient and Lyapunov index of the standard dispersion relation are mainly determined by the scale factor. As for the modified case, it is nearly determined by the momentum. In a method of the closed system, we discover that the Krylov complexity will show irregular oscillation before the horizon exits. The modified case will present faster growth after the horizon exists. Since the whole universe is an open system, the approach of an open system is more realistic and reliable. Then, we construct the exact wave function which is very robust only requiring the Lanczos coefficient proportional to $n$ (main quantum number). Based on it, we find the Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy could nicely recover in the case of a closed system under the weak dissipative approximation, in which our analysis shows that the evolution of Krylov complexity will not be the same with the original situation. We also find the inflationary period is a strong dissipative system. Meanwhile, our numerics clearly shows the Krylov complexity will grow during the whole inflationary period. But for the small scales, there will be a peak after the horizon exits. Our analysis reveals that the dramatic change in background (inflation) will significantly impact the evolution of Krylov complexity. Since the curvature perturbation will transit from the quantum level to the classical level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, as well as microscopic expressions for all of its transport coefficients, from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. In contrast to reference Phys. Rev. D 98(7) 2018, where a single component gas was considered, we perform our derivation for a locally neutral fluid composed of two massless particle species with opposite charges. We demonstrate that the magnetohydrodynamical equations of motion become dramatically different for this more realistic system. The shear-stress tensor no longer obeys a single differential equation; it breaks into three non-degenerate components with respect to the magnetic field, each evolving according to different dynamical equations. For large magnetic fields, we further show that the solution of this theory displays oscillatory behaviour that can no longer be described by an Israel-Stewart-like theory. Finally, we investigate the derived equations in a Bjorken flow scenario.</description>

      <title>Stairway to equilibrium entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy in the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 1RCBH model, which has a critical point in its conformal phase diagram defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. We also evaluate the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. We disclose a new feature (not present in the Bjorken flow dynamics analyzed in previous works), which is observed for all the analyzed initial data: the formation of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus in the form of a stairway for the entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the period of plateau formation in the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode of the system, which is therefore strongly tied to the late time dissipative dynamics of the system associated to the irreversibility of entropy production. For the particular case of the purely thermal SYM plasma at zero density and vanishing scalar condensate, we find that the period of the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode associated to the late time equilibration of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid, while at finite chemical potential the slowest quasinormal mode of the system is associated to the late time equilibration of the scalar condensate.</description>

      <title>Electroweak three-body decays in the presence of two- and three-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, formalism has been derived for studying electroweak transition amplitudes for three-body systems both in infinite and finite volumes. The formalism provides exact relations that the infinite-volume amplitudes must satisfy, as well as a relationship between physical amplitudes and finite-volume matrix elements, which can be constrained from lattice QCD calculations. This formalism poses additional challenges when compared with the analogous well-studied two-body equivalent one, including the necessary step of solving integral equations of singular functions. In this work, we provide some non-trivial analytical and numerical tests on the aforementioned formalism. In particular, we consider a case where the three-particle system can have three-body bound states as well as bound states in the two-body subsystem. For kinematics below the three-body threshold, we demonstrate that the scattering amplitudes satisfy unitarity. We also check that for these kinematics the finite-volume matrix elements are accurately described by the formalism for two-body systems up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Finally, we verify that in the case of the three-body bound state, the finite-volume matrix element is equal to the infinite-volume coupling of the bound state, up to exponentially suppressed errors.</description>

      <title>Detailed Report on the Measurement of the Positive Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment to 0.20 ppm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present details on a new measurement of the muon magnetic anomaly, $a_\mu = (g_\mu -2)/2$. The result is based on positive muon data taken at Fermilab's Muon Campus during the 2019 and 2020 accelerator runs. The measurement uses $3.1$ GeV$/c$ polarized muons stored in a $7.1$-m-radius storage ring with a $1.45$ T uniform magnetic field. The value of $ a_{\mu}$ is determined from the measured difference between the muon spin precession frequency and its cyclotron frequency. This difference is normalized to the strength of the magnetic field, measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The ratio is then corrected for small contributions from beam motion, beam dispersion, and transient magnetic fields. We measure $a_\mu = 116 592 057 (25) \times 10^{-11}$ (0.21 ppm). This is the world's most precise measurement of this quantity and represents a factor of $2.2$ improvement over our previous result based on the 2018 dataset. In combination, the two datasets yield $a_\mu(\text{FNAL}) = 116 592 055 (24) \times 10^{-11}$ (0.20 ppm). Combining this with the measurements from Brookhaven National Laboratory for both positive and negative muons, the new world average is $a_\mu$(exp) $ = 116 592 059 (22) \times 10^{-11}$ (0.19 ppm).</description>

      <title>Kinetic temperature and radial flow velocity estimation using identified hadrons and light (anti-)nuclei produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the investigation of the kinetic freeze-out properties of identified hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar p)$) along with light (anti-)nuclei $d (\bar d)$, $t (\bar t)$ and ${}^{3}He$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. A simultaneous fit is performed with the Blast-Wave (BW) model to the transverse momentum ({\ppt}) spectra of identified hadrons together with light (anti-)nuclei produced in $Au+Au$ collisions at {\sqrtsNN} = 7.7 -- 200 GeV at the RHIC and in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The energy and centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters, i.e., kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{kin}$) and collective flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ has been studied. It is observed that light (anti-)nuclei also participate in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision when included in a common fit with the light hadrons. We observe a marginal rise in $T_{kin}$ and a slight decrease in $\langle \beta \rangle$ when compared to the values obtained from the fit to light hadrons. A similar $\langle \beta \rangle$ and significantly larger $T_{kin}$ is observed when a fit is performed to only protons and light (anti-)nuclei. Both, $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$ show a weak energy dependence at most collision energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent data for the masses of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons determined using methods of lattice QCD for several values of the charm quark mass different from its physical mass are analysed in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. Nonperturbative parameters are extracted that arise at order ${\cal O}(1/m_c)$ in the heavy-quark mass expansion of a heavy-light meson mass. The determined parameters are used to establish the charm quark masses corresponding to the employed lattice sets.</description>

      <title>Dark Radiation with Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI 2024 and the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of extra relativistic degrees of freedom in the early Universe, contributing to the effective number of neutrinos $N_\text{eff}$, as $\Delta N_\text{eff}\equiv N_\text{eff}-3.044\geq 0$, in light of the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the DESI collaboration. We analyze one-parameter extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model where dark radiation (DR) is free streaming or behaves as a perfect fluid, due to self-interactions. We report a significant relaxation of upper bounds on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, with respect to previous BAO data from SDSS+6dFGS, when additionally employing Planck data (and supernovae data from Pantheon+), setting $\Delta N_\text{eff}\leq 0.39$ ($95\%$ C.L.) for free streaming DR, and a very mild preference for fluid DR, $\Delta N_\text{eff} = 0.221^{+0.088}_{-0.18}$ ($\leq 0.46$, $95\%$ C.L.). Applying constraints from primordial element abundances leads to slightly tighter constraints on $\Delta N_\text{eff}$, but they are avoided if DR is produced after Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For fluid DR we estimate the tension with the SH$_0$ES determination of $H_0$ to be less than $3\sigma$ and as low as $2\sigma$, and for free-streaming DR the tension is below $3\sigma$ if production occurs after BBN. This lesser degree of tension motivates a combination with SH$_0$ES in these cases, resulting in a $4.4\sigma-5\sigma$ evidence for dark radiation with $\Delta N_\text{eff}\simeq 0.6$ and large improvements in $\chi^2$ over $\Lambda$CDM, $-18\lesssim \Delta \chi^2\lesssim -25$.</description>

      <title>Color confinement due to spontaneous breaking of magnetic $U(1)_m^8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity is equal to 8 Abelian monopole currents of the Dirac type satisfying Abelian conservation rules kinematically. There exist magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries in non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. When the magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries are broken spontaneously, only states which are invariant under all $U(1)_e$ subgroups of $SU(3)$ can exist as a physical state. Such states are $SU(3)$ singlets. The QCD vacuum in the confinement phase is characterized by one long percolating monopole loop running over the whole lattice volume in both quenched and full QCD. The long loop in full QCD is on average a few times longer in comparison with that in quenched QCD case. Surprisingly, the monopole behaviors in full QCD seem independent of the bare quark mass suggesting irrelevance of Abelian monopoles to the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism.
  Existence of such Abelian magnetic monopoles in the continuum limit is studied in detail in $SU(3)$ by means of a block spin transformation of monopoles and the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The monopole density $\rho$ and the infrared effective monopole action $S(k)$ of $n$ blocked monopoles are determined for $a(\beta)=(0.04\sim 2)$fm and $n=1\sim 12$ blockings on $48^4$ lattice in quenched QCD and for $a(\beta)=0.0846(7)$fm and $n=1\sim 24$ on $96^4$ in full QCD at $m_\pi=146$MeV. Originally $\rho$ and $S(k)$ are a two-point function of $a(\beta)$ and the number of times of the blocking transformation $n$. However, both are found to be a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone in the quenched QCD which suggests the existence of the continuum limit. In the full QCD, the renormalization flow is observed similarly but the scaling is not yet proved. The distributions of the long loops show that monopole condensation occurs due to the entropy dominance over the energy for all $b$ considered.</description>

      <title>The Convergence Problem Of Gradient Expansion In The Relaxation Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>
