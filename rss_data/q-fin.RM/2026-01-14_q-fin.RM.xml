      <title>Systemic Risk in DeFi: A Network-Based Fragility Analysis of TVL Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systemic risk refers to the overall vulnerability arising from the high degree of interconnectedness and interdependence within the financial system. In the rapidly developing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, numerous studies have analyzed systemic risk through specific channels such as liquidity pressures, leverage mechanisms, smart contract risks, and historical risk events. However, these studies are mostly event-driven or focused on isolated risk channels, paying limited attention to the structural dimension of systemic risk. Overall, this study provides a unified quantitative framework for ecosystem-level analysis and continuous monitoring of systemic risk in DeFi. From a network-based perspective, this paper proposes the DeFi Correlation Fragility Indicator (CFI), constructed from time-varying correlation networks at the protocol category level. The CFI captures ecosystem-wide structural fragility associated with correlation concentration and increasing synchronicity. Furthermore, we define a Risk Contribution Score (RCS) to quantify the marginal contribution of different protocol types to overall systemic risk. By combining the CFI and RCS, the framework enables both the tracking of time-varying systemic risk and identification of structurally important functional modules in risk accumulation and amplification.</description>

      <title>Regime Discovery and Intra-Regime Return Dynamics in Global Equity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial markets alternate between tranquil periods and episodes of stress, and return dynamics can change substantially across these regimes. We study regime-dependent dynamics in developed and developing equity indices using a data-driven Hilbert--Huang-based regime identification and profiling pipeline, followed by variable-length Markov modeling of categorized returns. Market regimes are identified using an Empirical Mode Decomposition-based Hilbert--Huang Transform, where instantaneous energy from the Hilbert spectrum separates Normal, High, and Extreme regimes. We then profile each regime using Holo--Hilbert Spectral Analysis, which jointly resolves carrier frequencies, amplitude-modulation frequencies, and amplitude-modulation energy (AME). AME, interpreted as volatility intensity, declines monotonically from Extreme to High to Normal regimes. This decline is markedly sharper in developed markets, while developing markets retain higher baseline volatility intensity even in Normal regimes. Building on these regime-specific volatility signatures, we discretize daily returns into five quintile states $\mathtt{R}_1$ to $\mathtt{R}_5$ and estimate Variable-Length Markov Chains via context trees within each regime. Unconditional state probabilities show tail states dominate in Extreme regimes and recede as regimes stabilize, alongside persistent downside asymmetry. Entropy peaks in High regimes, indicating maximum unpredictability during moderate-volatility periods. Conditional transition dynamics, evaluated over contexts of length up to three days from the context-tree estimates, indicate that developed markets normalize more effectively as stress subsides, whereas developing markets retain residual tail dependence and downside persistence even in Normal regimes, consistent with a coexistence of continuation and burst-like shifts.</description>

      <title>Systemic Risk Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following several episodes of financial market turmoil in recent decades, changes in systemic risk have drawn growing attention. Therefore, we propose surveillance schemes for systemic risk, which allow to detect misspecified systemic risk forecasts in an "online" fashion. This enables daily monitoring of the forecasts while controlling for the accumulation of false test rejections. Such online schemes are vital in taking timely countermeasures to avoid financial distress. Our monitoring procedures allow multiple series at once to be monitored, thus increasing the likelihood and the speed at which early signs of trouble may be picked up. The tests hold size by construction, such that the null of correct systemic risk assessments is only rejected during the monitoring period with (at most) a pre-specified probability. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the good finite-sample properties of our procedures. An empirical application to US banks during multiple crises demonstrates the usefulness of our surveillance schemes for both regulators and financial institutions.</description>
