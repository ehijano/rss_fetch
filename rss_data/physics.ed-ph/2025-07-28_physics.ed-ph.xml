      <title>Informal Education is Essential to Physics: Findings of the 2024 JNIPER Summit and Recommendations for Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to reach the full civic and scientific potential of physics, this white paper calls for a culture change in physics to recognize informal physics education (also referred to as public engagement or outreach) as an essential disciplinary practice. That is, engaging in informal physics education (IPE) is part of what it means to ''do physics.'' In June 2024, we hosted a summit with forty-two members of the Joint Network for Informal Physics Education and Research (JNIPER) to discuss concrete steps for fostering this cultural shift in physics. We present key findings from the Summit to motivate this culture change: IPE makes the work of physicists relevant; fosters trust and supports a society where everyone benefits from science and technology advances; serves as a gateway for entering into the physics discipline, and for staying once there; and improves physicists' skills and research. We identify three levers for promoting the culture change: structures supporting IPE; engagement of interested, influential, and/or impacted parties; and integration of research-based IPE practices. Each lever is accompanied by associated recommendations for action directed at individuals, departments and institutions, topical groups such as JNIPER, and funders and (inter)national organizations. Our clarion call is for members and supporters of the IPE community to choose one recommendation per lever to prioritize and to set forth a roadmap for implementation. Together, we can establish IPE as a central physics practice, ultimately leading to a deeper connection between physics and society, strengthening our mutual potential and impact for good.</description>

      <title>Framing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Through Physics-Based Quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a substantial curricular overlap between calculus and physics, yet introductory physics students often struggle to connect the two. We introduce a quantity-based framing of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) to help unify learning across both disciplines. We propose a consistent approach to teaching definite integrals, including shared vocabulary and symbolism, to help students recognize how concepts like change, rate, and accumulation show up in both calculus and physics. We argue that the typical interpretation of the FTC in calculus, focusing on antiderivatives in closed form, doesn't align well with how physicists use or conceptualize integration. We advocate for an additional focus on Riemann sums and the underlying ideas of change, rate, products, and accumulation, which are fundamental in both fields. This approach can help students build a deeper, more coherent understanding of both mathematics and physics quantity. By aligning learning objectives across the disciplines, we argue that students can develop a stronger understanding of foundational mathematical principles.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula at the university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>
