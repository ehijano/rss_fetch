      <title>Nondestructive quantitative estimation of cross-sectional corrosion degree of rebar using self-magnetic flux leakage field variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately assess the structural performance of corroded reinforced concrete structures, obtaining precise information on the corrosion range and corrosion degree of rebar is crucial. In this study, based on a comprehensive analysis of extensive high-precision magnetic field and three-dimensional structural light scanning data of 21 corroded rebars, it was found that the self-magnetic flux leakage can accurately identify the corrosion range, with an error not exceeding 3%. A proposed quantitative index NHx of the self-magnetic flux leakage amplitude exhibits a linear correlation with the cross-sectional corrosion degree of rebar, whose probability density distribution can be accurately described using the Weibull distribution function. Utilizing the Weibull distribution function of NHx and a Bayesian model, automatically rapid quantification of the rebar's cross-sectional corrosion degree based on the non-destructive testing-derived NHx values can be conveniently realized. This self-magnetic flux leakage-based novel method for quantifying rebar's cross-sectional corrosion degree is accurate, efficient, and well-suited for practical engineering applications, providing robust support for a precise assessment of the structural performance of corroded reinforced concrete structures.</description>

      <title>The Third Generation of Nanogenerators: The Irreplaceable Potential Source Enabled by the Flexoelectric Nanogenerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electroneutrality assumption has long been adopted by scholars; however, this assumption may lead to an oversight of certain physical effects. Using derivations from a discontinuous medium, we have obtained an expression for the potential and energy of a many-body unipolar charge system, which corresponds well to its counterpart in a continuous medium. The compressed form of this expression suggests that compressing a macroscale charged body to the nanoscale can yield an enormous electric potential and energy, thereby establishing a concrete research framework for third-generation nanogenerators. This effect may serve as a crucial reference for understanding anomalous spatial electromagnetic distributions and divergent energy fields.</description>

      <title>Wireless and passive pressure detection using magneto-mechanical resonances in process engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A custom-developed magneto-mechanical resonator (MMR) for wireless pressure measurement is investigated for potential applications in process engineering. The MMR sensor utilises changes in the resonance frequency caused by pressure on a flexible 3D printed membrane. The thickness of the printed membrane plays a crucial role in determining the performance and sensitivity of MMRs, and can be tailored to meet the requirements of specific applications. The study includes static and dynamic measurements to determine the pressure sensitivity and temporal resolution of the sensor. The results show a minimum sensitivity of $0.06~\text{Hz mbar}^{-1}$ and are in agreement with theoretical calculations and measurements. The maximum sensor readout frequency is $2~\text{Hz}$ in this study. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the sensor is investigated, revealing a significant dependence of the resonance frequency on temperature. The developed MMR offers a promising and versatile method for precise pressure measurements in process engineering environments.</description>

      <title>Unilateral vibration transmission in mechanical systems with bilinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unilateral transmission refers to the scenario in which the waves transmitted through a system remain in pure tension or pure compression. This transmission phenomenon may occur in systems that exhibit different effective elasticity in compression and tension; i.e. bilinear elasticity. We present a computational investigation of unilateral transmission in the steady-state response of harmonically driven mechanical systems with bilinear coupling. Starting with two bilinearly coupled oscillators, we find that breaking the mirror symmetry of the system, in either elastic or inertial properties, facilitates unilateral transmission by allowing it to occur near a primary resonance. This asymmetry also enables nonreciprocal transmission to occur. We then investigate the nonreciprocal dynamics of the system, including linear stability analysis, with a focus on unilateral transmission. We also extend our discussion to a bilinear periodic structure, for which we investigate the influence of the number of units and energy dissipation on unilateral transmission. We report on the existence of stable nonreciprocal unilateral transmission near primary and internal resonances of the system, as well as other nonreciprocal features such as period-doubled and quasiperiodic response characteristics.</description>

      <title>Temporal Interface in Dispersive Hyperbolic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial inhomogeneity, temporal modulation, and engineered anisotropy of parameters of electromagnetic media offer numerous opportunities for manipulating light-matter interaction over the past decades. Here, we investigate a scenario in which we deal with the temporal interface, hyperbolic anisotropy in the form of layered structures, and frequency dispersion. We theoretically investigate how a monochromatic uniform plane wave - propagating in an unbounded, homogeneous, isotropic dielectric medium - undergoes changes due to the rapid temporal variation of such medium into a hyperbolic dispersive medium formed by the stack of thin metal-dielectric bilayers, in which the metal follows the lossless Drude dispersion and the dielectric is assumed to be dispersionless. We corroborate our analytical results by numerical simulations. We observe several interesting phenomena, such as the conversion of the original frequency into three pairs of frequencies, resulting in three sets of forward (FW) and backward (BW) waves. We present the amplitudes and the time-average Poynting vectors for such FW and BW waves and discuss some of the salient features of such temporal interface.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Polarization Switching in Al0.92Sc0.08N/GaN Heterostructures Grown by Sputter Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectric nitride thin films such as Al1-xScxN onto GaN templates could enable enhanced functionality in novel high-power transistors and memory devices. This requires a detailed understanding of the ferroelectric domain structures and their impact on the electric properties. In this contribution, the sputter epitaxy of highly coherent Al0.92Sc0.08N thin films grown on GaN approaching lattice-matching conditions is demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations reveal the formation of polar domains and the mechanism of domain propagation upon ferroelectric switching. Atomic resolution imaging suggests that polarization inversion is initiated by an interfacial switching process in which already the first atomic layer of Al1-xScxN changes its polarization from the as-grown M- to N-polarity. An atomically sharp planar polarization discontinuity is identified at the Al0.92Sc0.08N/GaN interface and described by atomic modeling and chemical structure analysis using electron energy loss spectroscopy, considering local lattice spacings. Moreover, residual domains with M-polarity are identified at the top Pt electrode interface. These insights on the location and the atomic structure of ferroelectric inversion domains in sputter deposited Al1-xScxN/GaN heterostructures will support the development of future non-volatile memory devices and novel HEMT structures based on ferroelectric nitride thin films via interface engineering.</description>

      <title>LoRePIE: $\ell_0$ Regularised Extended Ptychographical Iterative Engine for Low-dose and Fast Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended Ptychographical Iterative Engine (ePIE) is a widely used phase retrieval algorithm for Electron Ptychography from 4-dimensional (4-D) Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4-D STEM) measurements acquired with a focused or defocused electron probe. However, ePIE relies on redundancy in the data and hence requires adjacent illuminated areas to overlap. In this paper, we propose a regularised variant of ePIE that is more robust to low overlap ratios. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithm on an experimental 4-D STEM data of double layered Rotavirus particles acquired in a full scan with 85% overlap. By artificial down-sampling of the probe positions, we have created synthetic 4-D STEM datasets with different overlap ratios and use these to show that a high quality reconstruction of Rotavirus particles can be obtained from data with an overlap as low as 56%.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Formulation and its Relationship with TARC and Maximum Power Transfer Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous framework for analyzing arbitrary passive matching networks using a generalized Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent circuit. Unlike prior formulations, which often impose restrictive assumptions such as diagonal matching impedance matrices, our approach accommodates fully passive and interconnected multiport matching networks in their most general form. We first establish the mathematical conditions that any Linear Time Invarient, LTI, passive matching network must satisfy, starting from a $N \times N$ impedance matrix and continuing to $2N \times 2N$ and modified to follow the Thevenin-Helmholtz equivalent network. Using the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem (MPTT), we derive the scattering matrix $\mathbf{S}$ explicitly, showing its general applicability to arbitrary impedance configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the connection between the Total Active Reflection Coefficient (TARC) and the MPTT, proving that the TARC is inherently tied to the power conservation principle of the MPTT. This formulation not only unifies existing approaches, but also broadens the scope of applicability to encompass arbitrary physical passive systems. The equations and relationships derived provide a robust mathematical foundation for analyzing complex multiport systems, including interconnected phased arrays and passive antenna networks.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in Ca/Mn modified BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are emerging field in modern technology and physics. BaTiO3 is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping has led to MEC. In Ca and Mn modified BaTiO3 has been study with a series of Ba(1-x)Ca(x)Ti(1-y)Mn(y)O3 (x=y= 0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.09), in this MEC was only observed in x=0.03. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti bond angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P63/mmc space groups of BaTiO3 is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a pseudo Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, {\alpha}ME ~88 mVcm-1Oe-1 was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</description>
