      <title>Probing Lorentz Symmetry Violation through Lensing Observables of Rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a Kerr-like black hole solution-a rotating Bumblebee black hole (RBBH) with a Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$ and examine the strong lensing by it. The parameter $\ell$ changes the event horizon radius and photon sphere, resulting in a different lensing signature compared to the Kerr black hole of general relativity. Using the strong deflection limit formalism, we compute key observables such as the angular positions of relativistic images, their separation, magnification, and time delays for supermassive black holes Sgr A* and M87*. Our results show that the parameter $\ell$ has a profound influence on these observables, with $\ell &gt; 0$ suppressing and $\ell &lt; 0$ increasing the deflection angle compared to the Kerr case. We compare RBBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $\ell$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(18.25-33.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(13.71-25.02)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) Sgr A* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.005-0.81)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.003-0.6)~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{\text{mag}}$ $\in~(3.04-8.15)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the SMBHs and found that RBBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*. This demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing strong gravitational lensing to identify Lorentz symmetry violations in extreme gravity regimes. Weak lensing analysis and Einstein ring observations provide further constraints, producing an upper bound of $\ell \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$.</description>

      <title>Big bounce and black bounce in quasi-topological gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of quasi-topological (QT) gravity, we propose a novel model which is characterized by a bounce of the spacetime such that the singularity in standard general relativity can be avoided in both cosmological and black hole setups. Specifically, in the cosmological background, this model reproduces the modified Friedmann equation proposed in loop quantum cosmology, while in a black hole background, it produces a black bounce metric identical to that of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model resolves the singularity presented in the qOS model and provides a unified, manifestly covariant framework for general spacetimes, from which both the modified Friedmann equation and the qOS black hole metric can be derived. Furthermore, it establishes a profound correspondence between the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology and the QT gravity theory, suggesting that certain quantum gravitational effects in loop quantum gravity can be captured by adding an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In teleparallelism one is able to tackle the gravitational energy and angular momentum problems in a way that distinguishes this theory from other theories of gravity, such as general relativity. However, unlike the $4$-momentum, the quantity that is usually identified with a type of angular momentum does not have a clear interpretation. This problem is discussed, in particular the vanishing of the $3$-angular momentum in the time gauge, and some general properties are obtained.</description>

      <title>Heat propagation in rotating relativistic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.</description>

      <title>Shadows cast by a class of rotating black bounces with an anisotropic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a family of rotating black bounces with an anisotropic fluid obtained by using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. We analyze the main features of these spacetimes and obtain the geodesics for photons, which admit the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We then determine the shape of the shadow in terms of the parameters of the model. We present some relevant examples that exhibit some traits that distinguish these spacetimes from other related ones appearing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Enhanced long-duration gravitational-wave transient sources search pipeline with denoising and tree clustering algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-stage upgrade to the PySTAMPAS pipeline that boosts the search for long-duration (10 to 10^3 s) transients in gravitational-wave detector data. First, a denoising scheme combines complex 2D wavelet shrinkage with an adaptive pixel threshold to suppress noise while retaining signal power. Second, a KDTree nearest-neighbour algorithm clusters surviving pixels in O(log n) time, replacing the standard clustering approach. Tests with one week of LIGO O3b data show a large reduction in false-alarm rate and up to a factor-of-two improvement in search sensitivity. The computational time is also significantly reduced. These gains extend the sensitivity of all-sky, all-time searches to weaker and shorter transients, enabling rapid and deeper analyses in forthcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Hawking-R\'enyi thermodynamics of rotating black holes from locally Kiselev-type behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hawking-R\'enyi model requires the R\'enyi entropy thermodynamic temperature of a black hole to be identical with the surface gravity defined-, Hawking temperature. We investigate this approach for stationary black hole space-times, and show that a locally Kiselev-type behavior around the horizon with a coupled anisotropic fluid is sufficient to provide a solution to the problem. In addition, due to the rotating motion, an extra shift has also to be present in the effective mass of the black hole, which is determined by the rotation parameter, $a$, and the R\'enyi parameter, $\lambda$. We consider space-times with and without electric charge, and show that the functional form of the solution is the same for both cases. A full thermodynamic analysis of the model falls beyond the scope of this Letter, the main achievements are the derivation and interpretation of the solution.</description>

      <title>Agegraphic dark energy from entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the agegraphic dark energy from the entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole using the age of the universe as the IR cutoff. This model realizes the whole evolution of the universe, including the late-time accelerated expansion, and is consistent with observational Hubble data. Although it asymptotically approaches the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the future, statefinder analysis shows that late-time deviations allow the two models to be distinguished.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we demonstrate the interacting teleparallel gravity models, to describe the matter bounce scenario. We discussed two interacting models and find both are suitable choice to describe the bouncing phenomena. The co-moving Hubble radius, is demonstrated to check the establishment of the matter bounce scenario. All the energy conditions and the behaviour of EoS parameter is analysed. The violation of NEC at bounce epoch is one of the crucial result to establish bouncing behaviour is found to be obeyed. The other energy conditions behaviour is in agreement with the EoS parameter which lies in the phantom region at the bounce epoch in both the models.</description>

      <title>Temperature of McVittie Black Holes in Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the temperature of the McVittie black holes in cavities. The cavities are isothermal boxes that can make the McVittie black holes thermodynamically stable. The McVittie black holes are dynamical black holes, so the traditional action method can hardly be used to calculate the cavity temperature. We find that the cavity temperature $T_c$ can be derived from the McVittie black hole temperature $T_+$ and the Tolman relation. By setting $H^2$ to be $\Lambda/3$, we also get the cavity temperature of de Sitter black holes, which are interestingly the same with the results from the action method, but our method is much more easier.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to infrared GWs is forbidden by symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale scalar perturbations amplified during inflation can induce primordial gravitational waves through tensor-scalar interactions. A long-standing controversial issue is whether the one-loop corrections to tensor perturbations exist on large scales. Firstly, we demonstrate through direct one-loop calculations that one-loop corrections cancel each other out on large scales. We then proceed from the symmetry of the interacting system and directly prove, based on the Ward identity, the absence of one-loop corrections on large scales-without the need for specific loop diagram calculations. This is consistent with the results we previously obtained for scalar perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we start from static black hole (BH) immersed in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo and employ the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) to generate the rotating black hole solution with a dark matter halo. Then we study optical properties of newly obtained rotating BH in DM halo, including the shadow's geometrical shape, photon sphere and the dependence of the shadow radius from DM parameters. Additionally, assuming that spacetime of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is described by the newly obtained rotating BH solution we analyze the parameters of the model with shadow size estimates based on the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sara* SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Probing Formation Channels of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population study of stellar-mass black hole (sBH) binaries with ground-based gravitational wave detection has achieved tremendous success in recent years. Future observation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals will similarly require proper population analysis that identify the formation channels, measuring the branch ratio(s) and characterizing major properties within each major channel. In this work, we propose that the measurement of eccentricity, inclination, and component mass provides critical information to distinguish different formation channels and probe detailed formation mechanisms. Focusing on the dry and wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals, we establish the theoretical expectation of these observables in each formation channel. We also discuss how their distributions can be used to probe lifetime and turbulence level of active galactic nuclei disks, accretion patterns of supermassive black holes and population properties of sBHs within nuclear star clusters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper analyzes the thermodynamic properties of a special state of charged black holes, in which the event horizon becomes point-like and coincides with the singularity. It is shown that for such states, called black points, in contrast to Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes, the third law of thermodynamics in Planck's formulation is fulfilled. It is also shown that the formation of a black point is not a first-order phase transition. Considerable attention is paid to the special state of a black point with a doubly degenerate horizon, similar to the extreme state of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article considers the space-time structure of a charged black hole in the nonlinear Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We are discussing a special state of such a black hole in the form of a "black point" with a doubly degenerate horizon, for which the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime has a timelike singularity, and the effective space-time for photons turns out to be everywhere regular. This property makes extreme black points an intermediate state between traditional and absolutely regular black holes.</description>

      <title>A novel non-metricity extension of scalar-tensor gravity in spatially curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory within the framework of scalar-tensor gravity formulated in non-metricity geometry, focusing on spatially curved FLRW spacetimes. Employing the dynamical systems approach with Hubble-normalized variables, we reformulate the field equations into an autonomous system and analyze the resulting critical points. Four distinct cases, determined by the scalar coupling and potential functions, are studied in detail. For each case, we identify the existence and stability of equilibrium points, classify their cosmological behavior, and compute key observables such as the deceleration parameter and effective equation of state. Our results reveal that the theory admits matter-dominated eras, parameter-dependent saddle solutions, and stable de Sitter attractors capable of driving late-time cosmic acceleration. The additional scalar degree of freedom introduced by the non-coincident gauge plays a crucial role in determining the system's dynamics and viability. These findings emphasize the potential of scalar-tensor non-metricity gravity as a robust extension of general relativity and motivate further confrontation of the model with observational data.</description>

      <title>Generalised focusing theorem and dynamical horizon entropy in diffeomorphism-invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I summarise recent progress on light-ray focusing and horizon thermodynamics in general diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to bosonic matter. In pure gravity and with scalar or vector fields, the null-null gravitational equation of motion on a linearly perturbed Killing horizon generalises the Raychaudhuri equation, defining a generalised expansion that never increases under the null energy condition. This proves a generalised focusing theorem and defines an increasing horizon entropy (Wall entropy). When higher-spin fields are present, the generalised focusing theorem persists subject to a "higher-spin focusing condition", which I propose as a physical consistency constraint on higher-spin theories.</description>

      <title>Lensing in matched exterior and interior Kottler solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze gravitational lensing in a matched Kottler or Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where a uniform-density fluid sphere is smoothly joined to the exterior Kottler solution. We derive analytic expressions for the deflection angle of light rays traversing both regions, isolating the corrections induced by the interior mass distribution relative to the vacuum SdS case. The interior terms systematically reduce the bending angle and tangential magnification while enhancing the radial one, leading to a scale-dependent effect on the total magnification. Numerical evaluation shows a mild amplification for galaxy lenses and a demagnification for clusters, reflecting the contrast between compact and diffuse configurations. The induced $\Lambda$-contribution from the interior corrections further reduces the bending, but only slightly, consistent with its role in the vacuum SdS case. These results demonstrate that lensing observables retain a measurable imprint of interior structure in SdS-like lenses, crucial for refining realistic strong-lensing models.</description>

      <title>Stability of Relativistic Spheres Powered by Energy Profile in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamical irregularity of the locally anisotropic spherical fluids in the context of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We aim to describe the causes of energy-density irregularity of self-gravitating fluids and explain how those causes evolved from a homogeneous distribution at first. After computing field equations, we formulate two independent components of evolution equations. This expression involves the Weyl tensor and dynamical variables that would lead us to explain the emergence of inhomogeneity patterns. The relevant quantities involved in the irregularities within the initially homogeneous system are analyzed by considering particular non-dissipative and dissipative distribution cases. We find the theoretical irregularity factor consistent with astrophysical observations. With this relation, it is explicitly demonstrated that in the presence of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity terms, the inhomogeneity term decreases its role gradually as the observer moves away from the center towards the boundary surface.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.</description>

Abstract: We present a purely geometric and exact description of the interior dynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, formulated without invoking any specific gravitational theory and free of charges beyond its total mass ${\cal M}$. Its dynamical evolution gives rise to new singularities absent in the static case, whose resolution imposes highly restrictive conditions on gravitational collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric static black hole configurations that obey the vacuum equation of state: $p_{r}=-\rho $, where $p_{r}$ is the radial pressure, $\rho $ being energy density. We find in a closed form the metric for an arbitrary equation of state for tangential pressure $p_{\theta }(\rho )$. The corresponding formulas enable us to embrace compact Schwarzschild-like configurations and dispersed systems. They include metrics with a regular center and singular ones. In a particular case, the metric of the Kiselev black hole is reproduced.</description>

      <title>Investigating Hardware Injections in LIGO O3 Data: Simulated Signals from a Neutron Star in a Low-Mass X-ray Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00907v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA s third observing run (O3), simulated continuous gravitational wave (CW) signals were added to the added to the LIGO detectors as hardware (HW) injections, which are physical injections into the interferometer control loop via auxiliary laser actuation on test-mass mirrors. These included two periodic signals mimicking a spinning neutron star in a binary system, similar to the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1). HW injections serve as an important validation of a search method, as they occur before data cleaning and preparation. We searched for these injections using the model-based cross-correlation pipeline, which was used to search for CWs from Sco X-1 in the first three LVK observing runs. To simulate a realistic search, we used a search region of orbital parameter space of similar size to the plausible parameter ranges for Sco X-1, but containing the parameters of each HW injection. Our self-blinded analysis confidently detected one of the injections. The other, which was generated with a lower amplitude and in a more expensive region of frequency space, was not detected. We verified the imprint of this second signal by performing a deeper targeted search at its true parameters. However, such a deep search across the full parameter range would have been computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>The Teukolsky scalar as a gateway for quantizing gravity on rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization of linearized gravity on black hole spacetimes and the construction of states for that theory is a sought-after, yet difficult achievement. One of the main reasons is the difficulty of reconciling the positivity and gauge invariance of potential states. On Kerr spacetimes, the spin-2 Teukolsky scalars express the same degrees of freedom as the metric perturbations, up to pure gauge and radiative solutions, while avoiding the issue of gauge. In this work, we therefore explore the quantization of Teukolsky scalars on Kerr. We demonstrate that the theory can be written in terms of a formally hermitian Green-hyperbolic operator, allowing the construction of the algebra of observables. The reconstruction scheme for the metric perturbation allows us to keep track of the physical subalgebra. We indicate how this can be used to construct the Unruh state for this theory on any subextreme Kerr spacetime. This is based on a joint work with Dietrich H\"afner in preparation.</description>

      <title>Possible types of dark matter condensation in embedding gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of explaining the observed effects usually attributed to the existence of dark matter through a transition from GR to a modified theory of gravity - embedding gravity. Since this theory can be reformulated as GR with additional fictitious matter of embedding gravity (FMEG), which moves independently of ordinary matter, we analyse solutions in which FMEG behaves similarly to cold dark matter. An upper bound on the possible density of FMEG is obtained, which explains the absence of dark matter effects on small scales. Possible static condensed structures of FMEG are found, which can be reduced to configurations of the types wall, string, and sphere. In the latter case, FMEG exhibits the properties of an isothermal ideal gas which has a linear equation of state. The emerging spherical condensations of FMEG create potential wells that facilitate galaxy formation. For large values of the radius, the corresponding density distribution profile behaves in the same way as the pseudo-isothermal profile (ISO), which is successfully employed in fitting galactic dark halo regions, and provides flat galactic rotation curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact objects with magnetic dipole are considered as gravitational lenses. The presence of strong magnetic field near the photon sphere can affect the trajectory of light. We compute the deflection angle near the photon sphere on the equatorial plane of the magnetic dipole. In the Einstein-Maxwell gravity we use the asymptotic metric when a massive object has a magnetic dipole moment. In the Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity we use the effective metric accomodating the nonlinear electrodynamic effect. The deflection angles are expressed as perturbations from the Schwarzschild lensing. As a numerical estimate, we apply the result to a magnetar.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on the cosmological evolution in a Universe with a Weylian Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects that arise from the inclusion of Weylian boundary terms in the Einstein gravitational field equations in the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework. With the help of the generalized Friedmann equations for a Universe with a Weylian boundary, obtained for a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker FLRW metric, three distinct cosmological models can be constructed. The cosmological evolution is determined by a dissipative scalar field, and by the Weyl vector coming from the boundary. Several cosmological scenarios are obtained via the appropriate splitting of the generalized energy conservation equation. In the present work we obtain relevant constraints on these models by using the BBN data. In particular, the effects on the BBN that arise in the post warm-inflationary era will be examined by theoretically evaluating the measured abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). We consider firstly the primordial mass fraction estimates, and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature, which impose an upper limit on the effective energy density obtained from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviation from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma is therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Secondly, an upper limit will be considered in a numerical analysis performed through the usage of the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package, with the help of which we calculate the primordial abundances of the light elements by evaluating the thermonuclear rates within the considered modified gravity framework. Finally, an MCMC analysis will validate the cosmological model with Weylian boundary contributions, imposing relevant constraints on the initial conditions of the cosmos. The methodology is implemented in the python code \texttt{genesys}, which is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Generation of Kerr Geometry from Schwarzschild via BMS Supertranslations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, as the asymptotic symmetry group of asymptotically flat spacetimes, plays a central role in connecting infrared structures of gravity with soft theorems and gravitational memory. In this work, we investigate the extent to which BMS supertranslations can relate physically distinct black hole geometries. Focusing on the Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions, we show that the asymptotic structure of the Kerr spacetime can be generated from the Schwarzschild geometry via two successive supertranslations. These transformations yield a Kerr-like geometry at null infinity and reveal two distinct classes of supertranslation functions. The first, composed of $l=1$ spherical harmonics, corresponds to center-of-mass displacements and encodes the translational sector of the BMS group. The second, characterized by an infinite series of even-parity Legendre polynomials ($l \geq 2$), captures the intrinsic mass multipole structure of the Kerr spacetime. Our result illustrates how BMS supertranslations can act as symmetry transformations linking asymptotically flat black hole geometries, and that they encode physically meaningful soft hair consistent with the multipole structure of rotating black holes. This work supports a unified description of soft degrees of freedom in black hole spacetimes and underscores the role of infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetries in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Construction of Rotating Sen Black Holes via the Newman-Janis Algorithm and Applications to Accretion Disks and Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a rotating Sen black hole (BH) solution from the nonrotating limit static metric of the Sen BH using the Newman-Janis algorithm (NJA) and investigate the thin accretion disk and shadow of the rotating Sen BH. The characteristics of the rotating Sen BH, including its horizon and ergosurface, are analyzed. The results of our analysis indicate that an increase in the effective charge $q_{m}$ leads to corresponding increases in the energy flux, radiation temperature, and spectral luminosity. It is observed that the BH shadow size decreases with an increase in the parameter $q_{m}$. Furthermore, by comparing the theoretically predicted shadow diameters with observational data from M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^{*}$, we constrain the viable range of model parameters. The BH inclination angles are set to $17^{\circ}$, $50^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ for the analysis. Our results indicate that, within the constrained parameter space consistent with both M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^{*}$, the shared parameter bounds derived from the rotating Sen BH are given by $0.133158M&lt;q_{m}&lt;0.215561M$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations for the photon surface in spherical symmetry are worked out, starting from arXiv:gr-qc/0005050, in the most general dynamical setting. We show that the condition for a timelike hypersurface to be a photon surface can be reformulated as a non-autonomous dynamical system, whose analysis reveals that the same condition also holds when the surface is generated by a null radial geodesic.
  As an application, we consider a well-known model of a spherical dust cloud undergoing gravitational collapse. Comparing our findings with those in arXiv:1910.13758 we establish that the photon surface uniquely extends in the interior spacetime as a null hypersurface, allowing us to analytically investigate whether it covers the singularity developing in the LTB model.</description>

Abstract: The properties of the Melvin-type spacetime with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in $d$-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell gravity is studied. The solution is parametrised in terms of the `de Sitter radius' $\ell\propto\Lambda^{-1/2}$ and the magnetic field parameter $\beta$, and they are warped products of the form $\mathbb{R}^{1,d-3}\times S^2$, where $\mathbb{R}^{1,d-3}$ is the $(d-2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and $S^2$ is topologically a two-sphere which contains a conical singularity, whose nature depends on the product $\beta\ell$. In the limit $\ell\rightarrow\infty$, the $S^2$ decompactifies and the $d$-dimensional Melvin universe is recovered. The Freund--Rubin-type flux compactification model is shown to be another particular limit of this solution. We also calculate the flux and geodesics in this spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries are a central concept in our understanding of physics. In quantum theories, a quantum reference frame (QRF) can be used to distinguish between observables related by a symmetry. The framework of operational QRFs provides a means to describe observables in terms of their relation to a reference quantum system. We discuss a number of applications of QRFs in the context of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes: 1) A type reduction result for algebras arising from QFTs and QRFs with good thermal properties. 2) Quantisation of boundary electric fluxes and gluing procedures for quantum electromagnetism on spacetimes with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Modified Black Hole Potentials and Their Korteweg-de Vries Integrals: Instabilities and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves. Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.</description>

      <title>Inflationary dynamics of non-minimally coupled $f(R)$ matter-curvature theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum description of a gravitationally collapsed ball of dust proposed in Ref.~\cite{Casadio:2023ymt} is characterised by a linear effective Misner-Sharp-Hernandez mass function describing a matter core hidden by the event horizon. After reviewing the original model and some of its refinements, we investigate the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the resulting spacetime and compare it with the Schwarzschild case. Computations are performed within the WKB approximation, based on the Pad\'e approximants up to thirteenth order. Our analysis shows that deviations from the Schwarzschild spectrum are sensitive to the quantum nature of the core surface.</description>

      <title>Probing modified gravitational-wave dispersion with bursts from eccentric black-hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves in general relativity are non-dispersive, yet a host of modified theories predict dispersion effects during propagation. In this work, we consider the impact of dispersion effects on gravitational-wave bursts from highly eccentric binary black holes. We consider the dispersion effects within the low-energy, effective field theory limit, and model the dispersion relation via standard parameterized deformations. Such modified dispersion relations produce two modifications to the burst waveform: a modification to the time of arrival of the bursts in the detector, which appears as a 2.5PN correction to the difference in burst arrival times, and a modification to the arrival time of individual orbital harmonics within the bursts themselves, resulting in a Bessel-type amplitude modulation of the waveform. Using the Fisher information matrix, we study projected constraints one might obtain with future observations of repeating burst signals with LIGO. We find that the projected constraints vary significantly depending on the theoretical mechanism producing the modified dispersion. For massive gravitons and multifractional spacetimes that break Lorentz invariance, bounds on the coupling parameters are generally weaker than current bounds. For other Lorentz invariance breaking models such as Ho\v{r}ava-Lifschitz gravity, as well as scenarios with extra dimensions, the bounds in optimal cases can be 1-6 orders of magnitude stronger than current bounds.</description>

      <title>Conformal Geometry and Regularization of Disclinations by a Cosmological Constant in $(2+1)$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ on the geometry generated by a two-dimensional disclination in a conformal metric framework. For $\Lambda&gt;0$, we obtain an exact analytic solution of the Liouville-type equation, which regularizes the defect core, preserves the topological charge, and yields a compact space with finite volume and positive curvature. For $\Lambda&lt;0$, the solution must be obtained numerically and asymptotically approaches $R \to 3\Lambda &lt; 0$, producing an open hyperbolic geometry with divergent volume.
  In both regimes, the curvature profile is governed solely by the disclination strength $\alpha$, while the sign of $\Lambda$ dictates the global phase: compact and confined for $\Lambda&gt;0$, hyperbolic and delocalized for $\Lambda&lt;0$. This establishes a clear geometric dichotomy and shows that the cosmological constant provides a natural analytic regularization beyond cutoff-based treatments, with implications for analog gravity and two-dimensional condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory meets astrophysical environments: exploring a new frontier through osculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first study of how dark matter environments influence nonlinear gravitational memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries. Incorporating dark matter effects-gravitational potential, dynamical friction, and accretion-we compute nonlinear memory for both bound and unbound orbits under dark matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. For quasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile, we further account empirically for the evolution of the dark matter density. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for the detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave observatories. These results underscore the role of astrophysical environments in shaping gravitational memory, strengthening its interpretation as a hereditary imprint of past binary evolution and providing a novel bridge between dark matter physics and memory effects.</description>

      <title>Photon helicity asymmetry and duality anomaly in rotating waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, photon pairs can be excited out of the vacuum under the influence of dynamical gravitational fields. If the classical electromagnetic duality symmetry held at the quantum level, equal numbers of right- vs left-handed modes would be excited. However, a quantum chiral-like anomaly is known to affect this symmetry. In this work, we explore more experimentally accessible manifestations of this anomaly in analogue-gravity systems. Specifically, we describe the physical mechanism by which rotating, accelerating waveguides can induce an imbalance between right- and left-handed photons excited from the vacuum -- effectively signaling the emergence of the electromagnetic duality anomaly in controlled laboratory settings. To build physical intuition, we review first the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in 1+1 dimensions, which elegantly illustrates the connection between asymmetric particle pair creation and chiral anomalies.</description>

      <title>Thermality and athermality in the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In idealized treatments of the Unruh effect, a two-level atom is accelerated in a prescribed classical trajectory through the vacuum of a quantum field -- the Unruh bath -- which causes the atom's internal state to thermalize to a temperature proportional to the acceleration. This happens via emission and absorption of quanta by the atom, leading to a detailed balance between fluctuations in the Unruh bath and associated dissipation of the atom's internal energy. In any physical manifestation of the Unruh effect, the center-of-mass (CoM) degree of freedom of the atom is dynamical, and is therefore coupled to the Unruh bath via momentum recoil during the absorption/emission process. We study this scenario and show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem fails for the CoM degree of freedom, while still being upheld for the internal energy. That is, the CoM of an accelerated atom is not in thermal equilibrium with the Unruh bath, while its internal level can be.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Higher Harmonic Quasi-normal Mode in the Ringdown Signal of GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger offers a unique laboratory for testing general relativity in the strong-field regime and probing the properties of the final remnant black hole. In this study, we analyze the ringdown of GW231123 and find strong evidence for a multimode quasinormal spectrum. Our analysis employs two time-domain methodologies: a full Bayesian inference and an enhanced F-statistic framework, which we extend to enable the calculation of Bayesian evidence and the reconstruction of posterior distributions for all model parameters. We report a statistically significant detection of the $\ell|m|n=200$ mode, with a $\log_{10}$(Bayes factor) of $5.3$, commencing at $12\,M$ after the peak amplitude--a time well within the accepted linear regime. This two-mode analysis yields a redshifted final mass of $305.6^{+35.7}_{-47.3}M _{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.84^{+0.07}_{-0.14}$ at $90\%$ credibility, from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $14.5$. Furthermore, a test of the no-hair theorem performed using the two detected modes reveals no deviation from the predictions of general relativity. These results highlight the power of the F-statistic methodology to uncover nuanced features in gravitational wave signals, thereby providing novel insights into the fundamental properties of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical gravity (SG) aims to describe the semiclassical regime of quantum gravity. In SG quantum fields curve classical spacetime in an effective way through the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor, while propagating in the spacetime they curve. I discuss some advances in SG in three directions: (i) in understanding structural properties or special solutions of SG in spacetimes with isometries or special Hadamard states (ii) in understanding the initial value formulation and (iii) in black hole evaporation and why information loss is not expected. Semiclassical frameworks beyond SG are briefly surveyed. The hope is that this short note will provide a good set of references and indicate interesting open problems and directions.</description>

      <title>Loop Quantum Vector-Tensor Gravity and Its Spherically Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltoinian analysis of the vector-tensor theory of gravity is performed. The resulting geometrical dynamics is reformulated into the connection dynamics, with the real SU(2)-connection serving as one of the configuration variables. This formulation allows us to extend the loop quantization scheme of general relativity to the vector-tensor theory, thereby rigorously constructing its quantum kinematical framework. The scalar constraint is promoted to a well-defined operator in the vertex Hilbert space, to represent quantum dynamics. Moreover, the spherically symmetric model of the vector-tensor theory is obtained by the symmetric reduction. Following the general deparametrization strategy for theories with diffeomorphism invariance, the spherically symmetric model can be fully deparametrized in terms of the degrees of freedom of the vector field. The corresponding reduced phase space quantization is carried out. The physical Hamiltonian generating relative evolution is promoted to a well-defined operator on the physical Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown. In this paper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature fluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the physics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is enhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark matter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as primordial black holes and cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>The non-minimal 3-form cosmology and the rise of the cuscuton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 3-form theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity in an expanding Universe. First, we assume that the background is homogeneous and isotropic, and that the three-form is coupled to both the Ricci scalar and the Ricci tensor. We show that in this case, it propagates three degrees of freedom: a scalar mode and two tensor ones. Then, we consider an anisotropic background that corresponds to a Bianchi Type I Universe, and set the coupling with the Ricci tensor to zero. We show that, similarly to the Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity, this case leads to two branches for the background solutions - depending on the values of the 3-form. However, in contrast to the Proca case, we show that no extra modes appear. We explore the no-ghost conditions and speed of propagation for all three modes in both branches. Finally, we show that one of the branches can be written as a theory of a constrained scalar, coupled to a cuscuton field.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the trace-free Einstein tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian metric cannot arise by variation of a local diffeomorphism-invariant action functional with the (inverse) metric as field variable. We show that this statement remains true even for general local actions, without the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

Abstract: The Eisenhart lift is extended to the dynamics described by action-dependent Lagrangians. The resulting Brinkmann metrics depends on all coordinates. It is shown that the symmetries of the initial dynamics result in the existence of (conformal) Killing vectors of Brinkmann metric. An example is given of equivalent time- and action-dependent descriptions which result in conformally equivalent metrics.</description>

      <title>Very Massive, Rapidly Spinning Binary Black Hole Progenitors through Chemically Homogeneous Evolution -- The Case of GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the over 200 gravitational wave detections reported so far, GW231123 is a remarkable event that not only holds the record for the most massive black hole merger, but also exhibits extreme spins. Its origin is actively debated. Proposed scenarios include dynamical formation involving a sequence of mergers, Population III stars, accretion in an AGN disk and also more exotic explanations including primordial black holes and cosmic strings, each facing different challenges. Recent work showed that the incoming black holes of GW231123 can be formed out of massive rapidly rotating collapsing helium stars. Here, we address the question how such very massive rapidly rotating helium stars can be formed in very close binary systems. For this we explore chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) involving progenitors with masses above the pair-instability mass gap. We compute a grid of detailed massive binary models with the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the early evolution of binary progenitors and show that: (i) very massive ($M_i &gt; 140\, M_\odot$) CHE binaries at low metallicity ($Z=10^{-5}$) naturally produce rapidly rotating progenitors with high masses and high spins matching the properties of the black holes in GW231123 and (ii) the maximum spin of the progenitors is bound by their critical rotation rate leading to a tight correlation between the dimensionless spin and mass, $a \propto M^{-0.9}$, in models that have no hydrogen left. We conclude that the CHE channel appears to be a viable and natural scenario to produce progenitors. We compare and discuss the differences with earlier studies and comment on the large uncertainties in the final fate and collapse.</description>

      <title>LHS in LHS: A new expansion strategy for Latin hypercube sampling in simulation design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is a prominent tool in simulation design, with a variety of applications in high-dimensional and computationally expensive problems. LHS allows for various optimization strategies, most notably to ensure space-filling properties. However, LHS is a single-stage algorithm that requires a priori knowledge of the targeted sample size. In this work, we present LHS in LHS, a new expansion algorithm for LHS that enables the addition of new samples to an existing LHS-distributed set while (approximately) preserving its properties. In summary, the algorithm identifies regions of the parameter space that are far from the initial set, draws a new LHS within those regions, and then merges it with the original samples. As a by-product, we introduce a new metric, the LHS degree, which quantifies the deviation of a given design from an LHS distribution. Our public implementation is distributed via the Python package expandLHS.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new class of AdS/BCFT setups, where the world-volumes of end-of-the-world branes (EOW branes) are given by flat spaces, to explore flat space holography from an AdS bulk. We show that they provide gravity duals of CFTs in the presence of null boundaries. Our holographic calculations lead to many new predictions on entanglement entropy, correlation functions and partition functions for CFTs with null boundaries. By considering a bulk region between two EOW branes, we present an AdS/BCFT explanation that the flat space gravity is dual to a Carrollian CFT (CCFT), including the swing surface calculation of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures aim to highlight the remarkable symbiosis that currently exists between the physics of the very small and the physics of the very large, using the unsolved puzzle of the nature of Dark Energy as a vehicle for so doing. The lectures first summarize what we know observationally about the properties of Dark Energy (and the Dark sector more broadly) and then discuss several approaches to explain them. Along the way this involves determining the types of interactions that would on general grounds be expected to be present in the low-energy limit of fundamental theories involving the many hierarchy of scales we see around us. This includes (but is not limited to) a discussion of technical naturalness (and `t Hooft naturalness) as well as the arguments for their use as a criterion for distinguishing amongst candidate theories. Some recent approaches I find promising are briefly summarized at the end.</description>

      <title>Vacuum currents in elliptic pseudosphere tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effects of spatial topology, curvature, and magnetic flux on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution and formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles during cosmological phase transitions with mltiple vacua. Using a semiclassical approach with initial velocity fluctuations, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, quantum effects do not lead to the formation of double-layered vacuum bubbles, while flyover transitions allow for their stable formation by overcoming successive potential barriers. The evolution of these bubbles, including wall acceleration, collisions, and the formation of trapped regions, is explored through numerical simulations. Our results show that the dynamics of double-layered bubbles differ significantly from standard single-wall bubbles, with implications for cosmological observables such as gravitational wave production and baryogenesis. These findings indicate that flyover transitions represent a complementary decay mechanism to the conventional quantum tunneling process.</description>

      <title>Dissipation suppression for an Unruh-DeWitt battery with a reflecting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of an accelerated quantum battery (QB), modeled as an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field. The QB is driven by an external classical force acting as a charger. A major challenge in this setup is the environment-induced decoherence, which leads to energy dissipation of the QB. Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects analogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space, consistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a reflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the Unruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary, the relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB is placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly eliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a characteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the distance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the boundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect becomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath. Conversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect weakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our findings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum fluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights for optimizing QB performance. This work paves the way for the development of high-efficiency quantum energy storage systems in the relativistic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by string theory topics, we investigate the Reissner Nordstrom AdS black holes in noncommutative spacetime with Lorentzian smeared distributions. Concretely, we study certain thermodynamic properties including the criticality behaviors by computing the relevant quantities. For large radius approximations, we first derive the asymptotic expansions of the mass and charge functions appearing in the metric function of such black holes. Then, we approach the thermodynamics in the extended phase space. After the stability discussion, we examine the P V criticality in noncommutative geometry by calculating the corresponding thermodynamic quantities. As a result, we show that the proposed black holes exhibit certain similarities with Van der Waals fluid systems. Finally, we present a discussion on the Joule Thomson expansion showing perfect universality results appearing in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac states bound to vortices by a boson-fermion interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results are presented from numerical simulations of the flat-space nonlinear Maxwell-Klein-Gordon-Dirac equations. The introduction of a boson-fermion interaction allows a scalar vortex to act as a harmonic trap that can confine massive Dirac bound states. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the range of boson-fermion coupling strengths, Ginzburg-Landau parameters, and fermion effective masses that support the existence of bound state solutions. Solutions are time-evolved and are observed to be stable until the fermion number density becomes large enough to collapse the spontaneously broken vacuum of the condensate. Head-on scattering simulations are performed, and traditional vortex right-angle scattering is shown to break down with increased fermion number density, $n_f$. For sufficiently large $n_f$ and low velocity, the collision of two vortices results in a pseudostable bound state with winding number $m=2$ that eventually becomes unstable and decays into two $m=1$ vortices. For large $n_f$ and collision velocity, vortex scattering is observed to produce nontopological (zero winding number) scalar bound states that are ejected from the collision. The scalar bubbles contain coherent fermion bound states in their interiors and interpolate between the spontaneously broken vacuum of the bulk and the modified vacuum induced by the boson-fermion interaction.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational implications of black holes in toroidal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and observational implications for the charged torus-like black holes, a class of solutions distinct from the classical Schwarzschild black holes. We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and R\`{e}nyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.</description>

Abstract: The concept of energy lies at the foundation of physical science. In general relativity and quantum field theory, the positivity and conservation of energy are encapsulated by the so-called energy-momentum tensor and the energy conditions. In recent efforts to unify fundamental physics with quantum information, the energy conditions have come to play a crucial role in establishing numerous theorems. In this article, we review the basics of energy conditions in general relativity and their applications in gravitational physics, quantum field theory, and the holographic principle. Through these applications, we explore the profound connection between the energy conditions and quantum information</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cosmology is based on the cosmological principle, which states that the Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. When applied in its strict -- rather than statistical -- sense, the cosmological principle leads to the Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) model, which serves as background spacetime. This background is used to predict: (1) the dynamics of cosmic expansion; and (2) the kinematics of light propagation through the Universe, which dictates the interpretation of cosmological observations. In this lecture, we shall discuss the performance of the FLRW model for those purposes, and present some results on the so-called backreaction and fitting problems.</description>

Using covariant perturbation theory, the expression of the thermal partition function at second order in powers of curvatures is also obtained, including its nonlocal contributions. For conformal coupling, the Weyl anomaly at fourth order in derivatives and second order in curvatures is evaluated using both expansions and the results found to be consistent.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS hypermultiplets in harmonic superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet in AdS$_4$ background, starting from the proper realization of $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal group $SU(2,2|2)$ on the analytic subspace coordinates. The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -6 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x_5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper K\"ahler sigma models. We find the proper redefinition of $\theta$ coordinates ensuring the AdS-covariant form of the analytic superfield component expansions.</description>

      <title>A matter of perspective: how nanoscale optical defects limit cosmic-scale gravitational wave observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, have revolutionised as- tronomy. Now, future detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer aim to achieve even greater sensitivity. Advanced optical simulations are crucial to overcoming the challenges faced by these complex in- terferometers. Finesse, the leading interferometer simulation tool in the GW community, supports the design and commissioning of these detectors by modeling optical, quantum, and mechanical effects. A key focus is understanding optical defects that distort the shape of the laser light and limit detector performance. This work explores how nanoscale defects affect GW observations and presents recent advancements in modeling their effects to guide the development of next-generation detector optics.</description>

      <title>A Spin-Based Pathway to Testing the Quantum Nature of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.</description>

      <title>The Perfect Host: JWST Cepheid Observations in a Background-Free SN Ia Host Confirm No Bias in Hubble-Constant Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cycle 1 JWST observations of Cepheids in SN Ia hosts resolved their red-giant-dominated NIR backgrounds, sharply reducing crowding and showing that photometric bias in lower-resolution HST data does not account for the Hubble tension. We present Cycle 2 JWST observations of &gt;100 Cepheids in NGC 3447, a unique system that pushes this test to the limit by transitioning from low to no background contamination. NGC 3447, an SN Ia host at D~25 Mpc, is an interacting pair comprising (i) a spiral with mixed stellar populations, typical of H0 calibrators, and (ii) a young, star-forming companion (NGC 3447A) devoid of old stars and hence stellar crowdinga rare "perfect host" for testing photometric bias. We detect ~60 long-period Cepheids in each, enabling a "three-way comparison" across HST, JWST, and background-free conditions. We find no component-to-component offset (sigma&lt;0.03 mag; a calibration independent test), and a 50% reduction in scatter to ~0.12 mag in the background-free case, the tightest seen for any SN Ia host. Across Cycles 1-2 we also measure Cepheids in all SH0ES hosts observed by JWST (19 hosts of 24 SNe Ia; &gt;50% of the sample) and find no evidence of bias relative to HST photometry, including for the most crowded, distant hosts. These observations constitute the most rigorous test yet of Cepheid distances and provide strong evidence for their reliability. Combining JWST Cepheid measurements in 19 hosts (24 SNe Ia) with HST data (37 hosts, 42 SNe Ia) yields H0 = 73.49 +/- 0.93 km/s/Mpc. Including 35 TRGB-based calibrations (from HST and JWST) totals 55 SNe Ia and gives H0 = 73.18 +/- 0.88 km/s/Mpc, ~6 sigma above the LambdaCDM+CMB expectation.</description>

      <title>Quark, lepton and right-handed neutrino production via inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflationary expansion of space-time provides us with an efficient particle production mechanism in the Early Universe. The fermion production efficiency depends critically on the particle mass, which is generated via the Yukawa coupling and sensitive to the corresponding scalar field value. During inflation, scalar fields experience large quantum fluctuations driving the average field values to the Hubble scale and above. This applies, in particular, to the Higgs field, making the Standard Model fermions very heavy and facilitating their production. Using the Bogolyubov coefficient approach, we compute the corresponding fermion abundance taking into account time dependence of the mass term. We find that the Standard Model fermion and the right-handed neutrino production grows dramatically compared to the naive estimate based on the low energy masses. The inflationary production mechanism can be the leading source of the right handed neutrinos, if they gain a Majorana mass from the Yukawa coupling to a light scalar. We also find a lower bound on the mass of fermionic dark matter, which can be produced by inflation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian Sampling with Langevin Birth-Death Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference plays a central role in scientific and engineering applications by enabling principled reasoning under uncertainty. However, sampling from generic probability distributions remains a computationally demanding task. This difficulty is compounded when the distributions are ill-conditioned, multi-modal, or supported on topologically non-Euclidean spaces. Motivated by challenges in gravitational wave parameter estimation, we propose simulating a Langevin diffusion augmented with a birth-death process. The dynamics are rescaled with a simple preconditioner, and generalized to apply to the product spaces of a hypercube and hypertorus. Our method is first-order and embarrassingly parallel with respect to model evaluations, making it well-suited for algorithmic differentiation and modern hardware accelerators. We validate the algorithm on a suite of toy problems and successfully apply it to recover the parameters of GW150914 -- the first observed binary black hole merger. This approach addresses key limitations of traditional sampling methods, and introduces a template that can be used to design robust samplers in the future.</description>

      <title>Doppler shifted Hawking radiation from acoustic black holes in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a hydrodynamic flow, with flow becoming supersonic at some point, the subsonic-supersonic boundary behaves as the horizon of a black hole. Possibility of detecting Hawking radiation from such acoustic black holes has been investigated in a variety of laboratory systems, ranging from cold atom systems, to condensed matter systems with hydrodynamic flow of electrons, to relativistic heavy-ion collisions (at relatively lower collision energies). Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, with boost-invariant longitudinal flow of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a wide rapidity window has eluded this remarkable possibility because in this case the black hole horizon is dynamical, moving away from center with sound velocity, leading to infinite red shift of Hawking radiation. We show here that such a conclusion is premature. The QGP flow at very large rapidities, necessarily deviates from Bjroken boost invariant flow. Due to this, an observer close to that region sees black hole horizon with a finite redshift. It leads to non-trivial prediction of Hawking radiation affecting particle momentum distributions for a window of rapidities, leaving near central rapidity regions unaffected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, the gravitational path integral involves a sum over topologies, representing the joining and splitting of multiple universes. To account for topology change, one is led to allow the creation and annihilation of closed and open universes in a framework often called third quantization or universe field theory. We argue that since topology change in gravity is a rare event, its contribution to exponentially late-time physics is universally described by a Poisson process. This universal Poisson process is responsible for the plateau in the multi-boundary generalization of the spectral form factor at late times. In the Fock space of closed baby universes, this universality implies that the statistics of the total number of baby universes is captured by a coherent state. Allowing for the creation of asymptotic open universes calls for a noncommutative generalization of a Poisson process. We propose such an operator algebraic framework, called Poissonization, which takes as input the observable algebra and a (unnormalized) state of a quantum system and outputs a von Neumann algebra of a many-body theory represented on its symmetric Fock space. Physically, Poissonization is a generalization of the coherent state vacua of bipartite quantum systems or matrix quantum mechanics. The multi-boundary correlators of the Marolf-Maxfield toy model of baby universes, and the sum over bordisms of closed-open 2D topological quantum field theory, are entirely captured by Poissonization. In the Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity, the universal Poisson process reproduces the late-time correlators in the $\tau$-scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity distribution of extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present realistic eccentricity distributions for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) forming via the two-body relaxation channel in nuclear star clusters, tracking their evolution up to the final plunge onto the central Schwarzschild massive black hole (MBH). We find that EMRIs can retain significant eccentricities at plunge, with a distribution peaking at $e_\mathrm{pl} \approx0.2$, and a considerable fraction reaching much higher values. In particular, up to $20\%$ of the forming EMRIs feature $e_\mathrm{pl} &gt; 0.5$ for central MBH masses $M_\bullet$ in the range $10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot} \leq M_\bullet \leq 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$, partially due to EMRIs forming at large semi-major axes and "cliffhanger EMRI", usually neglected in literature. This highlights the importance of accounting for eccentricity in waveform modeling and detection strategies for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Furthermore, we find that the numerical fluxes in energy and angular momentum currently implemented in the FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) package may not adequately sample the full parameter space relevant to low-mass MBHs ($M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$), potentially limiting its predictive power in that regime. Specifically, for $M_\bullet=10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ we find that about $75\%$ ($50 \%$) of EMRIs at 2 years (6 months) from plunge fall outside the currently available flux parameter space. Our findings motivate the development of extended flux grids and improved interpolation schemes to enable accurate modeling of EMRIs across a broader range of system parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I perform a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation (or Boltzmann echoes) by combining the gravitational wave data from 47 binary black hole merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With a Bayesian inference approach, I found no statistically significant evidence for this signal in either of the 3 Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2 and GWTC-3. While the data does not provide definitive evidence against the presence of Boltzmann echoes, the Bayesian evidence for most events falls within the range of 0.3-1.6, with the hypothesis of a common (non-vanishing) echo amplitude for all mergers being weakly disfavoured at 2:5 odds. The only exception is GW190521, the most massive and confidently detected event ever observed, which shows a positive evidence of 9.2 for stimulated Hawking radiation. The ''look-elsewhere'' effect for this outlier event is assessed by applying two distinct methods to add simulated signals in real data, before and after the event, giving false (true) positive detection probabilities for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$, $4.4^{+2.0}_{-2.0} \%$ ($35 \pm 7 \%$, $35 \pm 15 \%$). An optimal combination of posteriors yields an upper limit of $A &lt; 0.4$ (at $90\%$ confidence level) for a universal echo amplitude, whereas $A \sim 1$ was predicted in the canonical model. To ensure the robustness of the results, I have employed an additional method to combine the events hierarchically. This approach involves using a target gaussian distribution and extracting the parameters from multiple uncertain observations, which may be affected by selection biases.</description>

Abstract: The Einstein Telescope faces a critical data analysis challenge with correlated noise, often overlooked in current parameter estimation analyses. We address this issue by presenting the statistical formulation of the likelihood that includes correlated noise for the Einstein Telescope or any detector network. By considering varying degrees of correlation, we probe the impact of noise correlations on the parameter estimation analysis of a GW150914-like event. We show that neglecting these correlations may significantly reduce the accuracy of the chirp mass reconstruction. This emphasizes how critical a proper treatment of correlated noise is, as presented in this work, to unlocking the wealth of results promised by the Einstein Telescope.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of the time evolution of the matter-gravity coupling on the luminosity distance, showing it can provide a natural explanation to the apparent Hubble tension. The gravitational coupling evolution induces a modification of the Friedman equation with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model, which we study in both the Einstein and Jordan frame. We consider a phenomenological parametrization of the low redshift variation of the coupling in a narrow redshift shell, showing how it can affect the distance of the anchors used to calibrate supernovae (SNe), while higher redshift background observations are not affected. This effect is purely geometrical, and it is not related to any change of the intrinsic SNe physical properties. The effects of a time varying gravity coupling only manifest on sufficiently long time scales, such as in cosmological observations at different redshifts, and if ignored lead to apparent tensions in the values of cosmological parameters estimated with observations from different epochs of the Universe history.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational-waves from Intermediate-Mass Binary Black Holes in Real Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exploratory investigation into using Simulation-based Inference techniques, specifically Flow-Matching Posterior Estimation, to construct a posterior density estimator trained using real gravitational-wave detector noise. Our prototype estimator is trained on a 9-dimensional space, and for training efficiency outputs posterior probability distributions for the binary black holes chirp mass and mass ratio. We use this prototype estimator to investigate possible effects on parameter estimation for Intermediate-Mass Binary Black Holes, and show statistically significant reduction in measurement bias. Although the results show potential for improved measurements, they also highlight the need for further work.</description>

      <title>On restrictions of current warp drive spacetimes and immediate possibilities of improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Looking at current proposals of so-called `warp drive spacetimes', they appear to employ General Relativity only at an elementary level. A number of strong restrictions are imposed such as flow-orthogonality of the spacetime foliation, vanishing spatial Ricci tensor, dimensionally reduced and coordinate-dependent velocity fields, to mention the main restrictions. We here provide a brief summary of our proposal of a general and covariant description of spatial motions within General Relativity, then discuss the restrictions that are employed in the majority of the current literature. That current warp drive models are discussed to be unphysical may not be surprising; they lack important ingredients such as covariantly non-vanishing spatial velocity, acceleration, vorticity, together with curved space, and a warp mechanism.</description>

Abstract: The Bumblebee vector model of spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) in Bianchi type I (BI) Universe to observe its effect on cosmological evolution is an interesting aspect of study in anisotropic cosmology. In this study, we have considered a Bumblebee field under vacuum expectation value condition (VEV) with BI metric and studied the cosmological parameters along with observational data. Further, we have studied the effect of anisotropy and the Bumblebee field in cosmic evolution. We have also studied the effect of both anisotropy and Bumblebee field while considering the Universe as a dynamical system. We have found that there are some prominent roles of both anisotropy and the Bumblebee field in cosmic evolutions. We have also observed an elongated matter-dominated phase as compared to standard cosmology. Moreover, while studying the dynamical system analysis, we have also observed the shift of critical points from standard $\Lambda$CDM results showing the anisotropy and the Bumblebee field effect.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on cosmological parameters in the Bianchi type III Universe with f(R,T) gravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bianchi type III (BIII) metric is an interesting anisotropic model for studying cosmic anisotropy as it has an additional exponential term multiplied to a directional scale factor. Thus, the cosmological parameters obtained for this BIII metric with the conventional energy-momentum tensor within the framework of a modified gravity theory and the estimation of their values with the help of Hubble, Pantheon plus and other observational data may provide some new information in cosmic evolution. In this work, we have studied the BIII metric under the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity theory and estimated the values of the cosmological parameters for three different models of this gravity theory by using the Bayesian technique. In our study, we found that all the models show consistent results with the current observations but show deviations in the early stage of the Universe. In one model we have found a sharp discontinuity in the radiation-dominated phase of the Universe. Hence through this study, we have found that all the $f(R,T)$ gravity models may not be suitable for studying evolutions and early stages of the Universe in the BIII metric even though they show consistent results with the current observations.</description>

      <title>Causal structure of nonhomogeneous dust collapse in effective loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the causal structure for spherically symmetric dust collapse within a model of effective loop quantum gravity in midisuperspace framework. We develop a general strategy (working beyond the dynamical model of our consideration) for constructing double null coordinates, allowing the extraction of conformal diagrams within single coordinate charts. With the methods introduced, we confirm that the homogeneous Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario resembles the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like picture. For the nonhomogenous collapse scenario, we construct the conformal diagrams, subsequently, we study its relevant properties, in particular, dust particles' trajectories, apparent horizons and shell-crossing singularities. We conclude that a significant region of spacetime remains inaccessible to the model's dynamics due to the formation of the shell-crossing singularities. The question of whether a timelike singularity, similar to that in the homogeneous dust ball collapse scenario, arises in the nonhomogeneous case remains unresolved. Furthermore, we find that phenomena such as black hole explosions or gravitational shock waves cannot be witnessed by an external observer who does not cross any horizon. Indeed, the collapse cannot take place within single asymptotic region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscous fluids can dissipate and alter the propagation of gravitational waves, as well as modify the relaxation and stability properties of self-gravitating fluids. This is particularly relevant in order to understand the relaxation to equilibrium of neutron stars, and their gravitational wave emission. Here we study the linearized theory of perturbations of spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluids. Dissipative effects are included through the hydrodynamics theory of Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK). This theory has been shown to be causal and stable, despite involving only first order gradients. We show how the problem reduces to two coupled wave equations in the axial sector, one of them associated to a novel viscous mode, and including explicitly dissipative terms. In the polar sector, we reduce the problem to five coupled wave equations and one additional constraint. We comment on their causal structure, and recover the causality bounds of the BDNK theory.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of gravitational lensing by Hu-Sawicki $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ gravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, gravitational lensing in the weak and strong field limits is investigated for black hole spacetime within the framework of Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity. We employ the Ishihara et al. approach for weak lensing and adopt Bozza's method for strong lensing to explore the impact of Hu-Sawicki model parameters on lensing phenomenon. The deflection angles are computed and analyzed in both the field limits. Our investigation in the weak as well as the strong lensing reveals that in the case of Hu-Sawicki black holes, photons exhibit divergence at smaller impact parameters for different values of the model parameters compared to the Schwarzschild scenario and the photon experiences negative deflection angle when impact parameter moves towards the larger impact parameter values. Additionally, by calculating strong lensing coefficients we study their behavior with model parameters. The strong lensing key observables associated with the lensing effect viz. the angular position $\vartheta_{\infty}$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_\text{mag}$ are estimated numerically by extending the analysis to supermassive black holes $\text{SgrA}^*$ and $\text{M87}^*$ and analyzed their behavior concerning the parameters for each black hole. The analysis shows that $\text{SgrA}^*$ demonstrates larger values of $\vartheta_{\infty}$ and $s$ relative to $\text{M87}^*$.</description>

      <title>Relational Observables in Group Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of covariant positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using techniques developed in the context of quantum reference frames. We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. The resulting family of relational observables provides a covariant framework to extract localized observables from GFT, which is typically defined in a perspective-neutral way. Then, we compare this formalism with previous proposals for relational observables in GFT. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observables overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. Nonetheless, there can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for other types of GFT states. Finally, we also use a specific class of POVMs to show how to project states and operators from the more general perspective-neutral GFT Fock space to a perspective-dependent one where a scalar matter field plays the role of a relational clock.</description>

Abstract: We explore a square-law k-inflation using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Focusing on scenarios where the Hubble parameter exhibits a power-law dependence on the k-field, our analysis encompasses the computations of crucial observables, such as the scalar power spectrum, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the scalar spectral index. We further constrain the model's parameters using Planck data and present a specific form of the potential. Our results demonstrate that the model aligns well with observational data.</description>

      <title>Vector wormholes as conduits for matter interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the dynamics of a massive one-form field, \textbf{B}, often referred to simply as a vector field, that is minimally coupled to standard Einstein gravity. In the framework of four-dimensional spacetimes, the theory of a massive one-form propagates three massive vector degrees of freedom. The inclusion of a self-interacting potential in this theory results in the breaking of gauge invariance. The breaking of such a fundamental symmetry in Classical Electromagnetism may introduce a ghost mode in massive vector theories, which generally leads to their instability. However, in the context of wormhole physics, the existence of at least one ghost degree of freedom turns out to be a necessary condition to support these exotic geometries within effective field theories. This requirement serves as a strong motivation for our work, wherein we explore the role and phenomenology of massive one-forms, minimally coupled to Einstein gravity, in providing the necessary conditions to sustain wormhole spacetimes. We further analyze the coupling of matter fields to such a vector field through conformal couplings and explore their impact on energy conditions and the physical viability of wormhole solutions.</description>

Abstract: This report provides a geometrical Yang-Mills theory, including gravity. The theory treats the space-time symmetry of the local Lorentz group in the same manner as the internal gauge symmetry. We extend this general relativistic Yang-Mills theory in the Minkowski space-time to a broader space, including Euclidean and Minkowskian spaces. In the extended space, we can transport topological achievements from the Euclidean Yang-Mills theory into the Lorentzian Yang-Mills theory. This extension also provides a relation between space-time and internal symmetry. The perspective provided by the extended theory suggests the novel relation between gravity and the weak force, leading us to the graviweak correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-modal stability of black hole spacetimes under linear perturbations. We show that large-amplitude growth can occur at finite time, despite asymptotic decay of linear perturbations. In the example presented, the physical mechanism is a transient form of superradiance, and is qualitatively similar to the transition to turbulence in Navier-Stokes shear flows. As part of the construction we provide a theorem for the positivity of QNM energies, and introduce a truncated-Hamiltonian approach to black hole pseudospectra which does not suffer from convergence issues.</description>

      <title>Strong Lensing Effect and Quasinormal Modes of Oscillations of Black Holes in $\boldsymbol{f(R,T)}$ Gravity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the strong lensing phenomenon and quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the case of black holes (BHs) surrounded by fluids within the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity, adopting a minimally coupled model of the theory. Our analysis is conducted for three surrounding fields corresponding to three different values of the parameter $\omega$ of the equations of state, each representing a unique class of BH solutions. A universal method developed by V.~Bozza is employed for strong lensing analysis and the WKB approximation method to compute the QNMs of oscillation of the BHs. The influences of the model parameters $\beta$ and $c_2$ on the deflection angle and associated lensing coefficients are analyzed. Our findings on lensing reveal that smaller values of $\beta$ and $c_2$ cause photon divergence at larger impact parameters as well as the lensing results converge to the Schwarzschild limit. Extending the analysis to the supermassive BH Sgr A*, we examine the outermost Einstein rings, estimate three lensing observables: angular position $\vartheta_{\infty}$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_\text{mag}$ for the BHs. For a specific values of $\beta$ and $c_2$, BHs with different field configurations exhibit substantial variations in their observable properties. The variation of amplitude and damping of QNMs with respect to the model parameter $\beta$ and $c_2$ is analyzed for the BHs. We found that the $\beta$ parameter has a direct correlation with the amplitude and an inverse relation with the damping of the QNMs, while $c_2$ has direct correlation with amplitude as well as damping. Further, we use the time domain analysis to verify the results and found a good match between the two methods.</description>

      <title>Shadow formation in gravitational collapse: Redshift and blueshift by spacetime dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A black hole illuminated by a background light source is observed as a black hole shadow. For a black hole formed by gravitational collapse of a transmissive object, redshift of light due to the spacetime dynamics is expected to play a crucial role in the shadow formation. In this paper, we investigate the redshift of light caused by the spacetime dynamics. First, we consider a spherical shell model. We see that the collapse of the shell typically leads to the redshift of light, while blueshift can be also observed in some cases. This result suggests that a shadow image is generally formed in the late stage of the gravitational collapse of a transmissive object. Second, we propose a covariant formula for the redshift of light in a general, dynamical, and spherically symmetric spacetime. This formula relates the redshift to the energy-momentum tensor of the background spacetime and provides its intuitive interpretation with a Newtonian analogy. The redshift effect analyzed in this work is regarded as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or the Rees-Sciama effect in gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Extension principles for the Einstein Yang--Mills system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the local existence theorem and establish an extension principle for the spherically symmetric Einstein Yang--Mills system (SSEYM) with $H^1$ data. This in addition implies Cauchy stability for the system.
  In contrast to a massless scalar field, the purely magnetic Yang--Mills field in spherical symmetry satisfies a wave-type equation with a singular potential. As a consequence, the proof of Christodoulou [10], based on an $L^\infty-L^\infty$ estimate, fails in the Yang--Mills context. Instead, we employ an $L^2$-based method, which is valid for both massless and massive scalar matter fields as well.</description>

      <title>Finite-Distance Gravitational Lensing of a Global Monopole in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole with a global monopole at finite distances. In this asymptotically nonflat spacetime, the deflection angle of light is decomposed into two parts: the first derives from the orbit differential equation, and the second originates from the metric itself. By absorbing the cosmological constant into the effective impact parameter, we derive an analytical expression for the first part using elliptic integrals. Combined with the second part, we obtain a complete exact solution for the deflection angle in this context. Additionally, considering that the distances from the source to the observer are large, we derive expressions for the light deflection angle in both the weak and strong field limits. In both cases, we find that the deflection is enhanced by the presence of the global monopole, further supporting its potential role as an alternative to elusive dark matter.</description>

      <title>Regge poles, grey body factors, and absorption cross sections for black hole metrics with discontinuity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently proposed by Rosato {\it et al.} and Oshita {\it et al.} that black hole greybody factors, as stable observables at relatively high frequencies, are more relevant quantities than quasinormal modes in modeling ringdown spectral amplitudes. It was argued that the overall contributions of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes conspire to produce stable observables through collective interference effects. In this regard, the present study investigates the Regge poles, the underlying quantities of the greybody factor governed by the singularities in the complex angular momentum plane, for perturbed black hole metrics. To this end, we generalize the matrix method to evaluate the Regge poles in black hole metrics with discontinuities. To verify our approach, the numerical results are compared with those obtained using a modified version of the continued fraction method. The obtained Regge pole spectrum is then used to calculate the scattering amplitude and cross-section. We show that the stability of these observables at moderate frequencies can be readily interpreted in terms of the stability of the Regge pole spectrum, particularly the low-lying modes. Nonetheless, destabilization still occurs at higher frequencies, characterized by the emergence of a bifurcation in the spectrum. The latter further evolves, leading to more significant deformation in the Regge poles, triggered by ultraviolet metric perturbations moving further away from the black hole. However, based on the validity of the WKB approximation, it is argued that such an instability in the spectrum is not expected to cause significant observable implications.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum speed limit and entanglement in flavor oscillations of neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Planckeons as mouths of quantum wormholes and holographic origin of spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that Planck-scale fluctuations ``planckeons'' realize a network of non-traversable Einstein--Rosen bridges and act as holographic devices. Modeling planckeons as wormhole mouths on extremal (RT) surfaces ties spacetime connectivity directly to entanglement. Using the Ryu--Takayanagi framework, we derive an entanglement entropy that governs the thermodynamics of the planckeon ensemble. The resulting partition function exhibits a high-temperature logarithmic entropy consistent with holographic scaling, while at low temperature the network freezes into a sparse remnant-like phase. A characteristic temperature $T_c$ (set by the planckeon gap) separates these regimes; in the noninteracting edge-mode description this marks a crossover (and becomes a genuine phase transition once interactions/pairing are included). Embedding a minimal length in the wormhole throat yields a quantum-corrected Bekenstein entropy in which the area term is supplemented by edge-mode contributions, thereby linking wormhole geometry with quantum-information flow and suggesting a holographic origin of spacetime and black-hole microstructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider configurations consisting of a gravitating nonlinear spinor field and a massless ghost scalar field providing a nontrivial spacetime topology. For such a mixed system, we have constructed families of asymptotically flat asymmetric solutions describing Dirac stars with wormhole topology. The physical properties of such systems are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the nonlinearity parameter of the spinor field, the spinor frequency, and the throat parameter. Depending on the specific values of these parameters, the configurations may be regular or singular and possess one or two throats, as well as they may contain possible horizons of different kinds. Furthermore, because of the asymmetry, masses and sizes of the configurations observed at the two asymptotic ends of the wormhole may differ considerably. For large negative values of the nonlinearity parameter, it is possible to obtain configurations whose masses are comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass and effective radii are of the order of kilometers.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves undergo redshift as they propagate through the expanding universe, and the redshift may exhibit time-dependent drift. Consequently, for any isolated gravitational wave sources, the mass parameter $\mathcal{M}$ and the redshift $z$ exhibit an observational degeneracy, typically manifesting in the waveform as the redshifted mass $\mathcal{M}(1+z)$. Matching together the wave propagation and the wave generation solutions, we show that dimensionless source parameters depending on mass $\mathcal{M}$ can break this degeneracy. Notably, the postmerger signal from binary neutron stars contains several dimensionless parameters that satisfy this condition, including the quality factors of different frequency components and their frequency ratios. Considering the observations of solely the postmerger signal by the Neutron star Extreme Matter Observatory or the Einstein Telescope, based on the Fisher analysis, we find that the redshift can be measured with fractional uncertainties of $\sim30\%$ for sources at $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.09$. Additionally, we present a corrected derivation of the waveform phase correction due to the redshift drift effect, rectifying a sign error in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Revisiting GW150914 with a non-planar, eccentric waveform model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration, GW150914, marked the start of a new exciting era in astronomy, enabling the study of the Universe through a new messenger. Since then, the field has grown rapidly, with the development of increasingly more sophisticated techniques to detect, analyze and interpret the signals. In this paper we revisit GW150914, presenting updated estimates of its source parameters using a waveform model developed within the EOB formalism, able to describe gravitational-wave emission from generic non-circular, non-planar binaries. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the signal and its properties, considering and contrasting various scenarios for the source: from the simplest, aligned-spin quasi-circular binary black hole merger, to more complex scenarios, including precession, eccentricity or both. Unsurprisingly, we find that the signal is consistent with a quasi-circular ($e &lt; 0.08$ at $15$ Hz), slowly spinning $(\chi_{\rm eff} = -0.03^{+0.12}_{-0.13})$ binary black hole merger, a-posteriori validating a considerable body of works. This is the first analysis performed with an inspiral-merger-ringdown model containing both eccentricity and precession.</description>

Abstract: We present new binary black hole simulations targeted to GW150914 using the GPU-accelerated code AthenaK. We compute the properties of the final remnant with the isolated horizon formalism and obtain gravitational-waveforms at future null infinity via Cauchy characteristic extraction. We compare our results with those obtained by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) groups, targeted to the same event. We find excellent agreement with the SXS and RIT results in the remnant mass, spin, and recoil velocity. For the dominant $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode of the gravitational-wave signal we find maximum dephasing of $\Delta \phi \simeq 0.35$ and amplitude difference of $\Delta A/A \simeq 0.4\%$. We use our newly computed waveform to re-analyze the GW150914 data and find posteriors for chirp mass, luminosity distance, and inclination that are broadely consistent with those obtained using semi-analytic waveform models. This work demonstrates the viability of AthenaK for many-orbits binary black hole merger simulations. A step-by-step tutorial, including all necessary input files and analysis scripts to reproduce our results, is available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: We show that any one-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric spacetime metrics can be embedded as the unique vacuum solution of a generally covariant theory of pure gravity. These theories, involving at most second-order derivatives of metrics, are uniquely determined -- up to two arbitrary functions that leave the metric unchanged -- by a framework that resolves the problem of restoring general covariance in the Hamiltonian formulation. This result solves the inverse problem of Birkhoff's theorem in full generality and establishes a systematic approach for reconstructing covariant dynamics from a given geometry. The framework applies broadly to quantum-gravity-inspired metrics, including regular black hole models, and provides a new tool for probing their dynamical and observational foundations.</description>

      <title>New model of spontaneous scalarization of black holes induced by curvature and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model of black hole spontaneous scalarization that combines a scalar--Gauss--Bonnet interaction with a non--minimal coupling to a U(1) gauge field (a dark photon or an electromagnetic field). This construction generalizes earlier single-coupling setups and allows both curvature--induced and matter--induced scalarization within one framework, which allows us to overcome the limitations of each mechanism alone. We focus on charged, spherically symmetric black holes and demonstrate that our model substantially expands the range of black hole masses and charges that permit scalar hair. Negative Gauss--Bonnet couplings, previously associated only with near--extremal charges or rapidly spinning black holes, now trigger scalarization for much broader charge intervals. We develop a numerical procedure to solve the field equations, and investigate the various properties of these black holes. This results in new branches emerging at distinct mass thresholds, a behavior not seen in the pure Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet or Einstein--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet--Ricci models. The scalar charge depends sensitively on the coupling parameters and on the $U(1)$ charge. Our analysis also shows that these black holes have larger entropy than their Reissner--Nordstr\"om counterparts and can become overcharged, surpassing the usual extremal limit of charge-to-mass ratio. Analyzing the scalar charge behavior suggests that adding matter-coupling appears to stabilize solutions that were previously prone to higher-order instabilities in pure Gauss--Bonnet models with quadratic coupling and broadens the range of possible configurations, making this model a promising candidate for further studies in strong gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Palatini gravity for a non-minimal geometry-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power and a linkage between higher-dimensional field theory and transport phenomena is proposed. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-M{\o}ller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range. The construction is gauge invariant, behaves consistently under limiting conditions, and can be matched to experimental stopping data through a single effective normalization constant.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework to Follow-up Continuous Gravitational Wave Candidates from Deep Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed-up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Extended Bodies and the GravoThermo Memory Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution, changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body ($\texttt{SEBOB}$): combining Effective One-Body inspirals and Backwards One-Body merger-ringdowns for aligned spin black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity gravitational waveform models are essential for realizing the scientific potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. While highly accurate, state-of-the-art models often rely on extensive phenomenological calibrations to numerical relativity (NR) simulations for the late-inspiral and merger phases, which can limit physical insight and extrapolation to regions where NR data is sparse. To address this, we introduce the Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body (SEBOB) formalism, a hybrid approach that combines the well-established Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework with the analytically-driven Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model, which describes the merger-ringdown from first principles as a perturbation of the final remnant black hole. We present two variants building on the state-of-the-art $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model: $\texttt{seobnrv5_nrnqc_bob}$, which retains standard NR-calibrated non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections and attaches a BOB-based merger-ringdown; and a more ambitious variant, $\texttt{seobnrv5_bob}$, which uses BOB to also inform the NQC corrections, thereby reducing reliance on NR fitting and enabling higher-order ($\mathcal{C}^2$) continuity by construction. Implemented in the open-source $\texttt{NRPy}$ framework for optimized C-code generation, the SEBOB model is transparent, extensible, and computationally efficient. By comparing our waveforms to a large catalog of NR simulations, we demonstrate that SEBOB yields accuracies comparable to the highly-calibrated $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model, providing a viable pathway towards more physically motivated and robust waveform models</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic events in the astrophysical environment are typically high-energetic, potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers $l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts, which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring density dependent B as a suitable parameter in higher dimensional approach with a non-linear equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this investigation, we present a singularity free interior solution of the Einstein field equation for a class of anisotropic compact objects in dimensions $D\geq4$. In accordance with the concept of Vaidya and Tikekar, the geometry of the physical $(D-1)$-space of a star corresponding to $t=constant$ hypersurface is assumed to be of a $(D-1)$ spheroid. For the fulfilment of causality condition, a limit of the spheroidal parameter ($\lambda$) is noted depending on the values of amount of anisotropy ($\alpha$) and space-time dimensions ($D$). We note that by switching off the extra parameters ($\alpha$ and $D$), previously obtained limit of $\lambda$ can be generated. To validate our findings, we compare the results obtained from our model with observational data of PSR J1614-2230 (mass=$1.908^{+0.016}_{-0.016}M_{\odot}$, radius=$11.93^{+0.50}_{-0.50}km$). It is noted that the best fit equation of state corresponds to polynomial equation of state of the order of five. We use this finding to develop a density dependent MIT bag model which seems to be useful for the correct description of compact object in our model. The mass radius relation shows that our model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars in four and higher dimensions. Furthermore, we also found that our model exhibits stability according to Generalised TOV equation, Herrera cracking condition, and the adiabatic index.</description>

      <title>Power-Law and Logarithmic Entropy-Corrected Ricci Dark Energy in a Non-Flat FRW Universe with Viscous Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the power-law corrected and the logarithmic-corrected versions of the Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) model in a non-flat FRW Universe filled with a viscous Dark Energy (DE) interacting with Dark Matter (DM). We propose to replace the infrared cut-off with the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$. We obtain the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{\Lambda}$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy density parameter $\Omega_{\Lambda} '$ in the presence of interaction between DE and DM for both corrections. We study the correspondence of the power-law entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (PLECRDE) and the logarithmic entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (LECRDE) models with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas (MVCG), the New Modified Chaplygin Gas (NMCG), the Yang-Mills (YM) and the Non Linear Electro-Dynamics (NLED) scalar field models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary paradigm has transformed our understanding of the early universe; yet most inflationary models are considered geodesically past-incomplete, suggesting a beginning of time or a primordial Big Bang singularity. The Borde--Guth--Vilenkin (BGV) theorem is often cited as demonstrating that all eternally inflating spacetimes must be past-incomplete. Utilizing a new theorem establishing geodesic completeness in generalized cosmologies, we present a simple, explicit class of inflationary solutions that are smooth, nonsingular, and geodesically complete for all time, including into the past. These models exhibit localized NEC violation but remain globally well-behaved in both temporal directions. The NEC violation is confined, allowing nonlocal quantum energy conditions such as the ANEC and SNEC to be satisfied. Our results suggest that eternal inflation can arise from controlled NEC-violating dynamics, offering a new, nonsingular, and past-eternal picture of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from earlier work. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that gravitational leptogenesis with dynamical $CPT$ breaking in an expanding universe can be reconciled with the exponential $f(R)$ gravity model, which introduces only one additional parameter $\beta$ compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This model incorporated axions as cold dark matter. For $L$ violating interactions, we consider both a non-supersymmetric model with heavy right-handed neutrino decay and a supersymmetric model with sneutrino decay. For both cases, we have shown that the required baryonic asymmetry could be obtained. We have also shown the variation of decoupling temperature for lepton number violating interactions with the $\beta$ parameter in exponential $f(R)$ gravity. Lepton number-violating model parameters are constrained with the $\beta$ through the decoupling temperature. An upper bound on the $\beta$ parameter of the exponential $f(R)$ gravity is also obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</description>

Abstract: We investigate time delays of wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-tensor effective field theories of gravity. The scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, being corrections of the lowest orders, can give rise to hairy black holes. By requiring infrared causality, we impose lower bounds on the cutoff scales of the theories. With these bounds, we further discuss the detectability of sGB gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Compared with the gravitational effective field theories that contain only the two tensor modes, adding extra degrees of freedom, such as adding a scalar, opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. This theory is relevant for the quantization of general relativity coupled to Standard Model of elementary particles. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. Being a topological invariant of 4-dimensional manifolds with boundary, this state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), realized as a functor between the category of cobordisms and the category of Hilbert spaces. After an introduction to appropriate category theory concepts and the construction of the state sum, we provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQFT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Angular bispectrum of matter number counts in cosmic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bispectrum of galaxy number counts is a key probe of large-scale structure, offering insights into the initial conditions of the Universe, the nature of gravity, and cosmological parameters. In this work, we present the first full-sky computation of the angular bispectrum in second-order perturbation theory without invoking the Limber approximation, and formulated for finite redshift bins via window functions. To our knowledge, even the Newtonian part within this setup is novel. Building on this, we also include, up to second order in perturbation theory, the dynamical general relativistic and radiation effects, together with the leading relativistic projection effects. For simplicity, we neglect tracer bias and line-of-sight integrated contributions, however note that in particular the former can be straightforwardly incorporated within our framework. We evaluate the bispectrum contributions for two redshift bins, $1.75 \leq z \leq 2.25$ and $0.55 \leq z \leq 0.65$, and compare our theoretical prediction against relativistic light-cone simulations, with line-of-sight integral effects removed so as to enable direct consistency checks. As expected, we find that the Newtonian contributions are typically one or more orders of magnitudes larger than the relativistic signal across the entire spectrum for both redshifts. At $z=2$, we find that projection and dynamical relativistic effects have comparable amplitudes on large scales; somewhat unexpectedly, however, radiation effects dominate the relativistic signal in the squeezed limit. At $z=0.6$, the expected hierarchy is recovered, though dynamical corrections remain non-negligible -- only a factor of 2-3 smaller than projection effects. Our theoretical results agree fairly well with simulation measurements for the total bispectrum. To facilitate future applications and reproducibility, we make the corresponding code publicly available.</description>

      <title>The Extended Uncertainty Principle from a Projector-Valued Measurement Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from an operational viewpoint, replacing wavefunction-based widths with apparatus-defined position constraints such as a finite slit of width $\Delta x$ or a geodesic ball of radius $R$. Using Hermitian momentum operators consistent with the EUP algebra, we prove a sharp lower bound on the product of momentum spread and preparation size in one dimension and show that it reduces smoothly to the standard quantum limit as the deformation vanishes. We then extend the construction to the dimensions two and three on spaces of constant curvature and obtain the corresponding bound for spherical confinement, clarifying its geometric meaning via an isometry to $S^2$ and $S^3$. The framework links curvature-scale effects to operational momentum floors and suggests concrete tests in diffraction, cold-atom, and optomechanical settings.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Testing the consistency of new Amati-correlated gamma-ray burst dataset cosmological constraints with those from better-established cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are promising cosmological probes for exploring the Universe at intermediate redshifts ($z$). We analyze 151 Fermi-observed long GRBs (datasets A123 and A28) to simultaneously constrain the Amati correlation and cosmological parameters within six spatially flat and nonflat dark energy models. We find that these datasets are standardizable via a single Amati correlation, suggesting their potential for cosmological analyses. However, constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter from A123 and the combined A123 + A28 data exhibit $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those derived from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most considered cosmological models. This tension indicates that these GRB data are unsuitable for jointly constraining cosmological parameters with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO and similar data. Although the A28 data constraints are consistent with the $H(z)$ + BAO data constraints, its limited sample size (28 GRBs) and high intrinsic scatter ($\sim0.7$) diminishes its statistical power compared to existing datasets.</description>

      <title>Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity: Baryogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling $\xi \sim (f/m_P)^2 $ or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the axion decay constant.</description>

      <title>Role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model: Examining growth dynamics and addressing the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear matter density perturbations in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, in which the $\Lambda$ is replaced by late-time ($z\sim2$) mirror AdS-dS transition, resulting in distinct growth dynamics. We use two complementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its evolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse scale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We derive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\Omega_{\rm m}^\gamma$ and growth index $\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like $\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations to grow more rapidly than in $\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just before the transition, with a growth rate around $15\%$ higher than $\Lambda$CDM around $z\sim2$. After the transition, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM behaves similarly to $\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant, leading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively suppresses growth. Before the transition, $\gamma$ remains below both the $\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\gamma\approx6/11$); during the transition, it increases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\Lambda$CDM while remaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays near $\gamma\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.28$ for $\Lambda_{\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\Lambda$CDM, we find $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM predicts a value of $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\gamma$ is treated as a free parameter in $\Lambda$CDM. This suggests that $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM may resolve the structure growth anomaly, without deviating from $\gamma \sim 0.55$.</description>

      <title>Peaks sphericity of non-Gaussian random fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the statistics of peaks of non-Gaussian random fields and implement it to study the sphericity of peaks. For non-Gaussianity of the local type, we present a general formalism valid regardless of how large the deviation from Gaussian statistics is. For general types of non-Gaussianity, we provide a framework that applies to any system with a given power spectrum and the corresponding bispectrum in the regime in which contributions from higher-order correlators can be neglected. We present an explicit expression for the most probable values of the sphericity parameters, including the effect of non-Gaussianity on the shape. We show that the effects of small perturbative non-Gaussianity on the sphericity parameters are negligible, as they are even smaller than the subleading Gaussian corrections. In contrast, we find that large non-Gaussianity can significantly distort the peak configurations, making them much less spherical.</description>

      <title>Suppression of composition $g$-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to $T\approx 5$ MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition $g$-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamical sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition $g$-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition $g$-modes. In contrast, the $f$-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of $g$-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamical sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTAO on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTAO to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTAO could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Probing Self-Interacting Dark Matter via Gravitational-Wave Background from Eccentric Supermassive Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the cross section of SIDM with $\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs observations in probing the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parametrize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode-stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Hubble constant estimation with dark standard sirens and galaxy cluster catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of using galaxy cluster catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. Together with binary black holes from the GWTC-3, we use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues. With these catalogues, we obtain $H_0 = 77^{+10}_{-10}$ and $81^{+8}_{-8}\, \text{km}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively, which demonstrates improvements on precision by factors of 10% and 38% respectively over the traditional galaxy catalogue result. This exploratory work paves the way towards precise and accurate cosmography making use of distant compact binary mergers from upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is highly relevant for
  understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron star merger. Our analysis is based on a
  set of nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) featuring systematic variations in the symmetry energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the
  isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical
  constraints. The global observable properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their variations in the
  $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian rotation, universal relations remain valid across
  the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $\Qsat$. In particular, we present explicit results for the moment
  of inertia ($I$) and quadrupole moment ($Q$) as functions of compactness, as well as for the moment of inertia-quadrupole moment
  relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality, with deviations typically within a range from a few percent to 10\%
  across a wide range of parameters. Additionally, we verify for our set of EoSs that the universality of $I$-$Q$ holds to higher accuracy
  (at the level of 1\%) in the slow-rotation approximation compared with the Kepler limit, where the relative error increases up to $\lesssim
  10\%$. Our findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling of maximally rotating
  compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them.</description>

      <title>From Fluctuation to Polarization: Imprints of $O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ Curvature Perturbations in CMB B-modes from Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing primordial curvature perturbations on small scales, beyond those accessible using cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, remains a major open challenge. Current constraints on the scalar power spectrum at these scales are either weak or rely heavily on model-dependent assumptions about small-scale structure. In this work, we propose a novel method to probe the small-scale primordial power spectrum using scalar-induced tensor perturbations, which are inevitably sourced by curvature perturbations at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. While induced tensor modes have traditionally been studied in the context of the stochastic gravitational wave background, we highlight a complementary observable: the distinctive pattern of B-mode polarization they imprint on the CMB. We compute the angular spectrum of these B-modes arising from enhanced scalar perturbations and show that the resulting signal can be competitive with inflationary predictions for values of the tensor-to-scalar ratio targeted in upcoming CMB experiments, most notably CMB-Stage 4. We map the region of the scalar power spectrum to which these future B-mode experiments will be sensitive and compare with existing constraints, finding it to exceed current sensitivities at $k \sim O(1-10)\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. In addition to providing a new CMB-based probe of the small-scale power spectrum, this work also motivates dedicated B-mode searches at higher multipoles ($\ell \gtrsim 100$).</description>

      <title>Investigating the imprint of quintessence in cosmic magnification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</description>

      <title>Learning geometries beyond asymptotic AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE, which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics. Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.</description>

      <title>The On-shell Gravity Action and Linear Dilaton Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Euclidean spacetime action on-shell provides a useful way of both testing holographic proposals and determining the string theory sphere partition function. We consider families of three-dimensional linear dilaton spacetimes for which there are holographic proposals that share features of a $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT. We extend the holographic renormalization program beyond AdS to this class of geometries by identifying the boundary terms needed for a well-defined variational principle and a finite on-shell action. We show that the spacetime energy or mass determined from the on-shell action matches the $T\overline{T}$-deformed two-dimensional CFT energy. This provides more evidence for the role of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation in this holographic correspondence.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Mass/Charge Relation and Weak No-hair Theorem Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one (real) dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture involving one real scalar: it can be turned on in a black hole, but it does not have a continuous independent hairy parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Carrollian geometry, we define super-Carrollian manifolds as a supermanifold with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion. As a physically relevant example, we show how a super-Carrollian manifold can be constructed from standard superspace $\mathbb{R}^{4|4}$ via an In\"on\"u--Wigner contraction.</description>
