      <title>Recovery of synchronized oscillations on multiplex networks by tuning dynamical time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heterogeneity among interacting dynamical systems or in the pattern of interactions observed in real complex systems, often lead to partially synchronized states like chimeras or oscillation suppressed states like inhomogeneous or homogeneous steady states. In such cases, recovering synchronized oscillations back is required in many applications but is a real challenge. We present how synchronized oscillations can be restored by tuning the dynamical time scales of the system. For this we use the model of a multiplex network where first layer of coupled oscillators is multiplexed with an environmental layer that can generate various possible chimera states and suppressed states. We show that by tuning the time scale mismatch between the layers , we can revive synchronized oscillations in both layers from these states. We analyse the nature of the transition to synchronization and the results are verified for two- and three-layer multiplex networks.</description>

      <title>Co-evolutionary dynamics for two adaptively coupled Theta neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural and technological networks exhibit dynamics that can lead to complex cooperative behaviors, such as synchronization in coupled oscillators and rhythmic activity in neuronal networks. Understanding these collective dynamics is crucial for deciphering a range of phenomena from brain activity to power grid stability. Recent interest in co-evolutionary networks has highlighted the intricate interplay between dynamics on and of the network with mixed time scales. Here, we explore the collective behavior of excitable oscillators in a simple networks of two Theta neurons with adaptive coupling without self-interaction. Through a combination of bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations, we seek to understand how the level of adaptivity in the coupling strength, $a$, influences the dynamics. We first investigate the dynamics possible in the non-adaptive limit; our bifurcation analysis reveals stability regions of quiescence and spiking behaviors, where the spiking frequencies mode-lock in a variety of configurations. Second, as we increase the adaptivity $a$, we observe a widening of the associated Arnol'd tongues, which may overlap and give room for multi-stable configurations. For larger adaptivity, the mode-locked regions may further undergo a period-doubling cascade into chaos. Our findings contribute to the mathematical theory of adaptive networks and offer insights into the potential mechanisms underlying neuronal communication and synchronization.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Forced van der Pol Equation with Frequent Phase Shifts Using Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tested the performance of reservoir computing (RC) in predicting the dynamics of a certain non-autonomous dynamical system. Specifically, we considered a van del Pol oscillator subjected to periodic external force with frequent phase shifts. The reservoir computer, which was trained and optimized with simulation data generated for a particular phase shift, was designed to predict the oscillation dynamics under periodic external forces with different phase shifts. The results suggest that if the training data have some complexity, it is possible to quantitatively predict the oscillation dynamics exposed to different phase shifts. The setting of this study was motivated by the problem of predicting the state of the circadian rhythm of shift workers and designing a better shift work schedule for each individual. Our results suggest that RC could be exploited for such applications.</description>
