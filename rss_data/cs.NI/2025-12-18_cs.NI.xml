      <title>UAV-enabled Computing Power Networks: Task Completion Probability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative framework that synergistically enhances computing performance through ubiquitous computing power distribution and dynamic computing node accessibility control via adaptive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning, establishing UAV-enabled Computing Power Networks (UAV-CPNs). In UAV-CPNs, UAVs function as dynamic aerial relays, outsourcing tasks generated in the request zone to an expanded service zone, consisting of a diverse range of computing devices, from vehicles with onboard computational capabilities and edge servers to dedicated computing nodes. This approach has the potential to alleviate communication bottlenecks in traditional computing power networks and overcome the "island effect" observed in multi-access edge computing. However, how to quantify the network performance under the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of both communication and computing power is a significant challenge, which introduces intricacies beyond those found in conventional networks. To address this, in this paper, we introduce task completion probability as the primary performance metric for evaluating the ability of UAV-CPNs to complete ground users' tasks within specified end-to-end latency requirements. Utilizing theories from stochastic processes and stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions that facilitate the assessment of this metric. Our numerical results emphasize that striking a delicate balance between communication and computational capabilities is essential for enhancing the performance of UAV-CPNs. Moreover, our findings show significant performance gains from the widespread distribution of computing nodes.</description>

      <title>More Capacity from Less Spectrum: Tapping into Optical-layer Intelligence in Optical Computing-Communication Integrated Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by massive investments and consequently significant progresses in optical computing and all-optical signal processing technologies lately, this paper presents a new architectural paradigm for next-generation optical transport network, entitled \textit{optical computing-communication integrated network}, which is capable of providing dual services at the optical layer, namely, computing and communication. This approach seeks to exploit the potential for performing optical computing operations among lightpaths that traverse the same intermediate node. \textit{Optical-layer intelligence concept} is thus introduced as the capability to perform computing / processing at the lightpath scale to achieve greater spectral and/or computing efficiency. A case study focusing on optical aggregation operation is introduced, highlighting the key differences between optical computing-communication integrated network and its current counterpart, optical-bypass ones. A mathematical formulation for optimal designs of optical-aggregation-enabled network is then provided and performance comparison with traditional optical-bypass model is drawn on the realistic NSFNET topology.</description>

      <title>DNS-based dynamic context resolution for SCHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LPWANs are networks characterised by the scarcity of their radio resources and their limited payload size. LoRaWAN offers an open, easy-to-deploy and efficient solution to operate a long-range network. To efficiently communicate using IPv6, the LPWAN working group from the IETF developed a solution called Static Context Header Compression (SCHC). It uses context rules, which are linked to a given End Device, to compress the IPv6 and UDP header. Since there may be a huge variety of End Devices profile, it makes sense to store the rules remotely and use a system to retrieve the profiles dynamically. In this paper we propose a mechanism based on DNS to find the context rules associated with an End Device, allowing it to be downloaded from an HTTP Server. We evaluate the corresponding delay added to the communications using experimental measurements from a real testbed.</description>

      <title>Packet-Level Traffic Modeling with Heavy-Tailed Payload and Inter-Arrival Distributions for Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins of radio access networks require packet-level traffic generators that reproduce the size and timing of packets while remaining compact and easy to recalibrate as traffic changes. We address this need with a hybrid generator that combines a small hidden Markov model, which captures buffering, streaming, and idle states, with a mixture density network that models the joint distribution of payload length and inter-arrival time (IAT) in each state using Student-t mixtures. The state space and emission family are designed to handle heavy-tailed IAT by anchoring an explicit idle state in the tail and allowing each component to adapt its tail thickness. We evaluate the model on public traces of web, smart home, and encrypted media traffic and compare it with recent neural network and transformer based generators as well as hidden Markov baselines. Across most datasets and metrics, including average per-flow cumulative distribution functions, autocorrelation based measures of temporal structure, and Wasserstein distances between flow descriptors, the proposed generator matches the real traffic most closely in the majority of cases while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters. The full model occupies around 0.2 MB in our experiments, which makes it suitable for deployment inside digital twins where memory footprint and low-overhead adaptation are critical.</description>

      <title>GenAI-enabled Residual Motion Estimation for Energy-Efficient Semantic Video Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication addresses the limitations of the Shannon paradigm by focusing on transmitting meaning rather than exact representations, thereby reducing unnecessary resource consumption. This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput. For semantic communication metrics, PENME improves PSNR by about 40%, increases MS-SSIM by roughly 19%, and reduces LPIPS by nearly 35%, compared with the baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI for Integrated Sensing and Communication: Analysis, Framework, and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key development direction in the sixth-generation (6G) era, which provides essential support for the collaborative sensing and communication of future intelligent networks. However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Time and Power Management in SWIPT-EH CIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for joint time allocation and power control in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) system with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The CIoT transmitter autonomously manages energy harvesting (EH) and transmissions using a learnable time switching factor while optimizing power to enhance throughput and lifetime. The joint optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process under small-scale fading, realistic EH, and interference constraints. We develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN) enhanced with an upper confidence bound. Simulations benchmark our approach, showing superior performance over existing DRL methods.</description>

      <title>Attention in Motion: Secure Platooning via Transformer-based Misbehavior Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused (BCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for EH-Enabled Cognitive-IoT Under Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating cognitive radio (CR) has become a practical solution to address the challenge of spectrum scarcity, leading to the development of cognitive IoT (CIoT). However, the vulnerability of radio communications makes radio jamming attacks a key concern in CIoT networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach designed to optimize throughput and extend network lifetime of an energy-constrained CIoT system under jamming attacks. This DRL framework equips a CIoT device with the autonomy to manage energy harvesting (EH) and data transmission, while also regulating its transmit power to respect spectrum-sharing constraints. We formulate the optimization problem under various constraints, and we model the CIoT device's interactions within the channel as a model-free Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP serves as a foundation to develop a double deep Q-network (DDQN), designed to help the CIoT agent learn the optimal communication policy to navigate challenges such as dynamic channel occupancy, jamming attacks, and channel fading while achieving its goal. Additionally, we introduce a variant of the upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm, named UCB-IA, which enhances the CIoT network's ability to efficiently navigate jamming attacks within the channel. The proposed DRL algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge and uses locally observable information such as channel occupancy, jamming activity, channel gain, and energy arrival to make decisions. Extensive simulations prove that our proposed DRL algorithm that utilizes the UCB-IA strategy surpasses existing benchmarks, allowing for a more adaptive, energy-efficient, and secure spectrum sharing in CIoT networks.</description>

      <title>BECS: A Privacy-Preserving Computing Resource Sharing Mechanism for 6G Computing Power Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G networks provide secure and reliable information transmission services for the Internet of Everything, thus paving the way for 6G networks, which is anticipated to be an AI-based network, supporting unprecedented intelligence across applications. Abundant computing resources will establish the 6G Computing Power Network (CPN) to facilitate ubiquitous intelligent services. In this article, we propose BECS, a computing sharing mechanism based on evolutionary algorithm and blockchain, designed to balance task offloading among user devices, edge devices, and cloud resources within 6G CPN, thereby enhancing the computing resource utilization. We model computing sharing as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to improve resource utilization while balancing other issues. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we devise a kernel distance-based dominance relation and incorporated it into the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III, significantly enhancing the diversity of the evolutionary population. In addition, we propose a pseudonym scheme based on zero-knowledge proof to protect the privacy of users participating in computing sharing. Finally, the security analysis and simulation results demonstrate that BECS can fully and effectively utilize all computing resources in 6G CPN, significantly improving the computing resource utilization while protecting user privacy.</description>

      <title>Observation Compression in Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed ISAC Systems: From Signal Reconstruction to Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict on the Cloud Computing Risk Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how geopolitical tensions catalyze IT risk evolution through systematic analysis of the conflict's impact on data sovereignty, cybersecurity paradigms, and cloud infrastructure strategies. Using a structured qualitative synthesis methodology, we analyzed 68 sources including threat reports, regulatory documents, and policy analyses from 2022-2025. Our findings reveal a 48% increase in cyber incidents during 2024, accelerated data localization across more than 40 countries, and growing sovereign cloud adoption. We propose a validated multi-layered framework integrating resilient architectures, data-centric security, and geopolitically-informed governance. The framework addresses gaps in traditional IT risk management by incorporating state-sponsored threat considerations and human element vulnerabilities. Key contributions include empirical evidence of geopolitical risk acceleration, a practical implementation framework with measurable outcomes, and concrete guidance for organizations navigating digital sovereignty challenges.</description>

      <title>A Fair, Flexible, Zero-Waste Digital Electricity Market: A First-Principles Approach Combining Automatic Market Making, Holarchic Architectures and Shapley Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics.
  Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes.
  The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule.
  Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution.
  Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes. The architecture is climate aligned and policy configurable, but requires a managed transition and new operational tools for system operators and market participants.</description>
