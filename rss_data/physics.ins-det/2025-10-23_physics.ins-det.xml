      <title>Calibration-free Rydberg Atomic Receiver for Sub-MHz Wireless Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploitation of sub-MHz (\textless 1 MHz) can be beneficial for a plethora of applications like underwater vehicular communication, subsurface exploration, low-frequency navigation etc. The traditional electrical receivers in this band are either hundreds of meters long or, when miniaturized, inefficient and bandwidth-limited, making them inapplicable for practical underwater implementations. Such obstacles can be circumvented by the emerging Rydberg atomic receiving technology, which is capable of detecting fields from DC up to the terahertz regime with compact structure. Against this background, we propose a method to detect sub-MHz electric fields without further calibration. Specifically, a physics-based model of the combined DC and AC-Stark response is established. Based on the model, we modulate the DC-Stark spectrum with the received signal and extract its amplitude by fitting the cycle-averaged, symmetric Stark-split peaks. Then we map this swing directly to the intrinsic atomic polarizability. By such operations, the proposed method can remove the dependence on electrode spacing or field-amplitude references. For performance evaluation, six-level Lindblad simulations and experiments are conducted at a low-frequency field of 30 kHz demonstrate a minimum detectable field of 5.3 \text{mV}/\text{cm}, with stable readout across practical optical-power variations. The approach manages to expand operating range of Rydberg atomic receivers below 1 MHz, and enables compact, calibration-free quantum front ends for underwater and subsurface receivers.</description>

      <title>Reducing suspension control noise with interferometric sensors -- an experimental concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the limiting noise sources of ground-based gravitational wave detectors at frequencies below 30 Hz is control-induced displacement noise. Compact laser interferometric sensors are a prime candidate for improved local displacement sensing. In this paper we present the design of an experiment that aims to demonstrate the advantages of interferometric sensors over shadow sensors. We focus on the compact balanced readout interferometer (COBRI) - a sensor currently in development that is based on deep frequency modulation. We mount COBRIs on two HAM Relay Triple Suspension (HRTS) systems that suspend two mirrors forming an optical cavity. By measuring the length stability of this cavity relative to a stable reference we aim to probe the direct motion reduction when using COBRIs for active damping and we aim to investigate their behavior and auxiliary functions, such as absolute ranging, in the context of the 6 degree-of-freedom controls of the suspensions. Here we describe the design of the experiment and simulations of the achievable noise levels that were obtained using mechanical models of the HRTS suspensions. We discuss all relevant noise sources, the modeled influence of the interferometric sensor damping and the current limitations and necessary improvements of our testing facility in terms of seismic pre-isolation to achieve a shadow sensor limited noise at around 5 Hz, where, according to our simulations, we can demonstrate superior performance for COBRIs in the longitudinal degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>CosmicWatch: The Desktop Muon Detector(v3X)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CosmicWatch Desktop Muon Detector (v3X) is a compact, low-cost, and portable device designed for detecting ionizing radiation, including cosmic-ray muons. Building on previous iterations, the v3X introduces significant hardware and firmware improvements that enhance sensitivity, usability, and data acquisition capabilities. The detector integrates a plastic scintillator and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM), custom designed electronics for signal processing, onboard data storage, OLED display, environmental sensors, and USB connectivity. With a total component cost under \$100 and a build time suitable for high school students, the v3X is ideal for education, outreach, and introductory research applications in particle and astroparticle physics. This paper details the design, performance, and potential use cases of the v3X, supported by example measurements demonstrating its functionality.</description>

      <title>Long Term Study of Sedimentation and Biofouling at Cascadia Basin, the Site of the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: STRings for Absorption Length in Water (STRAW)-a and b were pathfinder instruments deployed to characterize the anticipated site of the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment (P-ONE), which is a future neutrino telescope that will be located in the North Pacific Ocean. Measurements of the evolution of the optical transmission efficiency from STRAW-a showed a decline over the detector's lifetime for the upward-facing modules. Video footage of the pathfinders strongly suggested this decline was caused by biofouling and sedimentation. We measure the effect of biofouling and sedimentation to be a decrease in the transparency of upward-facing optical surfaces over 5 years of operations. A majority of downward-facing optical surfaces, which will dominate P-ONE's sensitivity to astrophysical sources, showed no visible biofouling. Extrapolations motivated by biological growth models estimated that these losses started around 2.5 years after deployment, and suggest a reduction in transparency ranging from 35$\%$ of the original to complete obscuration for the upward-facing modules. Samples of biofouling were taken in order to identify the microbial diversity of these organisms and inform potential intervention strategies. Results of the microbial samples and a candidate anti-biofouling strategy that will be tested on upcoming P-ONE instruments are discussed.</description>
