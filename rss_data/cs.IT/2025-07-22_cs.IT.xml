      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Distributed Computation via Task Replication and Local Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a distributed computation problem in the presence of Byzantine workers where a central node wishes to solve a task that is divided into independent sub-tasks, each of which needs to be solved correctly. The distributed computation is achieved by allocating the sub-task computation across workers with replication, as well as solving a small number of sub-tasks locally, which we wish to minimize due to it being expensive. For a general balanced job allocation, we propose a protocol that successfully solves for all sub-tasks using an optimal number of local computations under no communication constraints. Closed-form performance results are presented for cyclic allocations. Furthermore, we propose a modification to this protocol to improve communication efficiency without compromising on the amount of local computation.</description>

      <title>Constructions and List Decoding of Sum-Rank Metric Codes Based on Orthogonal Spaces over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum-rank metric codes, as a generalization of Hamming codes and rank metric codes, have important applications in fields such as multi-shot linear network coding, space-time coding and distributed storage systems. The purpose of this study is to construct sum-rank metric codes based on orthogonal spaces over finite fields, and calculate the list sizes outputted by different decoding algorithms. The following achievements have been obtained.
  In this study, we construct a cyclic orthogonal group of order $q^n-1$ and an Abelian non-cyclic orthogonal group of order $(q^n-1)^2$ based on the companion matrices of primitive polynomials over finite fields. By selecting different subspace generating matrices, maximum rank distance (MRD) codes with parameters $(n \times {2n}, q^{2n}, n)_q$ and $(n \times {4n}, q^{4n}, n)_q$ are constructed respectively. Two methods for constructing sum-rank metric codes are proposed for the constructed MRD codes, and the list sizes outputted under the list decoding algorithm are calculated. Subsequently, the $[{\bf{n}},k,d]_{{q^n}/q}$-system is used to relate sum-rank metric codes to subspace designs. The list size of sum-rank metric codes under the list decoding algorithm is calculated based on subspace designs. This calculation method improves the decoding success rate compared with traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Typicality with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to analyze a closed-loop feedback system where a transmitter probes a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) and can adapt its inputs based on the previous channel outputs. We prove that, regardless of the transmitter's strategy, the conditional type of the outputs given the inputs remains close to the DMC transition law $P_{Y|X}$. This general result enables the study of fundamental limits in certain adaptive systems.
  As an application, we establish a converse result for an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) model. In this setting, the transmitter also functions as a radar receiver, aiming to simultaneously transmit a message over the channel and estimate the channel state from the backscattered feedback signals. We show that the fundamental limits of the closed loop system are the same as of the open-loop system where the transmitter can use the feedback signal to estimate the state but not to produce adaptive channel inputs. This result holds as long as the sum of the admissible-average-decoding-error-probability, denoted $\epsilon$, and the admissible-excess-distortion-probability, denoted $\delta$, is below $1$, i.e., $\delta +\epsilon &lt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Active RISs: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-empowered communication has emerged as a transformative technology for next generation wireless networks, enabling the programmable shaping of the propagation environment. However, conventional RISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely attenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures, capable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter investigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active RISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single Power Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell level using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received signal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are derived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and amplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints. Regarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit cell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the derivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model. Furthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection coefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations, enabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can effectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE trade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the available power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing that a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal performance.</description>

      <title>A Robust 5G Terrestrial Positioning System with Sensor Fusion in GNSS-denied Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a terrestrial localization system based on 5G infrastructure as a viable alternative to GNSS, particularly in scenarios where GNSS signals are obstructed or unavailable. It discusses network planning aimed at enabling positioning as a primary service, in contrast to the traditional focus on communication services in terrestrial networks. Building on a network infrastructure optimized for positioning, the paper proposes a system that leverages carrier phase (CP) ranging in combination with trilateration to localize the user within the network when at least three base stations (BSs) provide line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. Achieving accurate CP-based positioning requires addressing three key challenges: integer ambiguity resolution, LOS/NLOS link identification, and localization under obstructed LOS conditions. To this end, the system employs a multi-carrier CP approach, which eliminates the need for explicit integer ambiguity estimation. Additionally, a deep learning model is developed to identify NLOS links and exclude them from the trilateration process. In cases where LOS is obstructed and CP ranging becomes unreliable, the system incorporates an error-state extended Kalman filter to fuse complementary data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and cameras. This hybrid approach enables robust tracking of moving users across diverse channel conditions. The performance of the proposed terrestrial positioning system is evaluated using the real-world KITTI dataset, featuring a moving vehicle in an urban environment. Simulation results show that the system can achieve a positioning error of less than 5 meters in the KITTI urban scenario--comparable to that of public commercial GNSS services--highlighting its potential as a resilient and accurate solution for GNSS-denied environments.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Enabled Green and Secure Offloading for Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-user uplink mobile edge computing (MEC) network, where the users offload partial tasks securely to an access point under the non-orthogonal multiple access policy with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) against a multi-antenna eavesdropper. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem of minimizing the total energy consumption subject to secure offloading requirement, and we build an efficient block coordinate descent framework to iteratively optimize the number of local computation bits and transmit power at the users, the RIS phase shifts, and the multi-user detection matrix at the access point. Specifically, we successively adopt successive convex approximation, semi-definite programming, and semidefinite relaxation to solve the problem with perfect eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), and we then employ S-procedure and penalty convex-concave to achieve robust design for the imperfect CSI case. We provide extensive numerical results to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate that RIS plays a significant role in realizing a secure and energy-efficient MEC network, and deploying a well-designed RIS can save energy consumption by up to 60\% compared to that without RIS. We further reveal impacts of various key factors on the secrecy energy efficiency, including RIS element number and deployment position, user number, task scale and duration, and CSI imperfection.</description>

      <title>Error Detection Based on Generalized Successive Cancellation List Decoding for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding has been widely adopted for polar codes, which allows near maximum likelihood performance with sufficiently large list size. In this work, we show that, if the list size is $2^\gamma$, where $\gamma$ is the fundamental quantity called mixing factor, then a modification to SCL decoding can implement Forney's generalized decoding rule. Hence, it provides an efficient means to discard unreliable decisions. The performance achieved by short polar codes under the proposed generalized SCL decoding is analyzed via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-RIS-Empowered Communication Systems: Capacity Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, using statistical physics methods, asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are presented. While nominally valid in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of communities in a graph entails identifying clusters of densely connected vertices; the area has a variety of important applications and a rich literature. The problem has previously been situated in the realm of error correcting codes by viewing a graph as a noisy version of the assumed underlying communities. In this paper, we introduce an encoding of community structure along with the resulting code's parameters. We then present a novel algorithm, SASH, to decode to estimated communities given an observed dataset. We demonstrate the performance of SASH via simulations on an assortative planted partition model and on the Zachary's Karate Club dataset.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Alignment for AI-Native MIMO Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\bar{\Gamma}$ be the point-hyperplane geometry of a projective space $\mathrm{PG(V)},$ where $V$ is a $(n+1)$-dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ of order $q.$ Suppose that $\sigma$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider the projective embedding $\varepsilon_{\sigma}$ of $\bar{\Gamma}$ into the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$ mapping the point $([x],[\xi])\in \bar{\Gamma}$ to the projective point represented by the pure tensor $x^{\sigma}\otimes \xi$, with $\xi(x)=0.$ In [I. Cardinali, L. Giuzzi, Linear codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry -- part I: the Segre embedding (Jun. 2025). arXiv:2506.21309, doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2506.21309] we focused on the case $\sigma=1$ and we studied the projective code arising from the projective system $\Lambda_1=\varepsilon_{1}(\bar{\Gamma}).$ Here we focus on the case $\sigma\not=1$ and we investigate the linear code ${\mathcal C}(\Lambda_{\sigma})$ arising from the projective system $\Lambda_{\sigma}=\varepsilon_{\sigma}(\bar{\Gamma}).$ In particular, after having verified that $\mathcal{C}( \Lambda_{\sigma})$ is a minimal code, we determine its parameters, its minimum distance as well as its automorphism group. We also give a (geometrical) characterization of its minimum and second lowest weight codewords and determine its maximum weight when $q$ and $n$ are both odd.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Sequence Model: Sample Complexities of Testing, Estimation and LFHT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian sequence model, i.e. $X \sim N(\mathbf{\theta}, I_\infty)$, where $\mathbf{\theta} \in \Gamma \subset \ell_2$ is assumed to be convex and compact. We show that goodness-of-fit testing sample complexity is lower bounded by the square-root of the estimation complexity, whenever $\Gamma$ is orthosymmetric. We show that the lower bound is tight when $\Gamma$ is also quadratically convex, thus significantly extending validity of the testing-estimation relationship from [GP24]. Using similar methods, we also completely characterize likelihood-free hypothesis testing (LFHT) complexity for $\ell_p$-bodies, discovering new types of tradeoff between the numbers of simulation and observation samples.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. These codes are defined from Abelian Galois extensions extending the construction of Gabidulin codes over arbitrary cyclic Galois extensions. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects any error of rank up to half the minimum distance.</description>

Abstract: We develop a unified Data Processing Inequality PAC-Bayesian framework -- abbreviated DPI-PAC-Bayesian -- for deriving generalization error bounds in the supervised learning setting. By embedding the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) into the change-of-measure technique, we obtain explicit bounds on the binary Kullback-Leibler generalization gap for both R\'enyi divergence and any $f$-divergence measured between a data-independent prior distribution and an algorithm-dependent posterior distribution. We present three bounds derived under our framework using R\'enyi, Hellinger \(p\) and Chi-Squared divergences. Additionally, our framework also demonstrates a close connection with other well-known bounds. When the prior distribution is chosen to be uniform, our bounds recover the classical Occam's Razor bound and, crucially, eliminate the extraneous \(\log(2\sqrt{n})/n\) slack present in the PAC-Bayes bound, thereby achieving tighter results. The framework thus bridges data-processing and PAC-Bayesian perspectives, providing a flexible, information-theoretic tool to construct generalization guarantees.</description>

      <title>Learning to Bid in Non-Stationary Repeated First-Price Auctions</title>

Abstract: First-price auctions have recently gained significant traction in digital advertising markets, exemplified by Google's transition from second-price to first-price auctions. Unlike in second-price auctions, where bidding one's private valuation is a dominant strategy, determining an optimal bidding strategy in first-price auctions is more complex. From a learning perspective, the learner (a specific bidder) can interact with the environment (other bidders, i.e., opponents) sequentially to infer their behaviors. Existing research often assumes specific environmental conditions and benchmarks performance against the best fixed policy (static benchmark). While this approach ensures strong learning guarantees, the static benchmark can deviate significantly from the optimal strategy in environments with even mild non-stationarity. To address such scenarios, a dynamic benchmark--representing the sum of the highest achievable rewards at each time step--offers a more suitable objective. However, achieving no-regret learning with respect to the dynamic benchmark requires additional constraints. By inspecting reward functions in online first-price auctions, we introduce two metrics to quantify the regularity of the sequence of opponents' highest bids, which serve as measures of non-stationarity. We provide a minimax-optimal characterization of the dynamic regret for the class of sequences of opponents' highest bids that satisfy either of these regularity constraints. Our main technical tool is the Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD) framework with a novel optimism configuration, which is well-suited for achieving minimax-optimal dynamic regret rates in this context. We then use synthetic datasets to validate our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate that our methods outperform existing ones.</description>
