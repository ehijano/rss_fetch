      <title>A Novel Approach to Evaluating Battery Charger Controller Design with Nonlinear PID Controller in an Extendable CHIL Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and development of power electronics converters pose a multitude of challenges. The evaluation of power electronics converters, particularly when operating at high power levels, presents a significant task, offering designers a deeper understanding of the functionality. Several methodologies have been devised to conduct hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests, which are classified into two main categories: controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) and power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) tests. This paper explores the advantages and drawbacks of these two approaches and introduces a straightforward and cost-effective CHIL method for initial proof of concept and risk-free controller training. This method is based on the interaction between MATLAB/Simulink and Python. To assess the operation of the proposed system, a modeled battery pack (96S1P) is charged using a modeled battery charger converter, employing a non-linear PID controller. In this scenario, the controller benefits from the CC-CV technique for charging the battery pack. The results are presented in the final section.</description>

      <title>Anticipating Optical Availability in Hybrid RF/FSO Links Using RF Beacons and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) communications offer reliable but low data rates and energy-inefficient satellite links, while free-space optical (FSO) promises high bandwidth but struggles with disturbances imposed by atmospheric effects. A hybrid RF/FSO architecture aims to achieve optimal reliability along with high data rates for space communications. Accurate prediction of dynamic ground-to-satellite FSO link availability is critical for routing decisions in low-earth orbit constellations. In this paper, we propose a system leveraging ubiquitous RF links to proactively forecast FSO link degradation prior to signal drops below threshold levels. This enables pre-calculation of rerouting to maximally maintain high data rate FSO links throughout the duration of weather effects. We implement a supervised learning model to anticipate FSO attenuation based on the analysis of RF patterns. Through the simulation of a dense lower earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulated satellite network, highlighting the balance between predictive accuracy and prediction duration. An emulated cloud attenuation model is proposed which provides insight into the temporal profiles of RF signals and their correlation to FSO channel dynamics. Our investigation sheds light on the trade-offs between prediction horizon and accuracy arising from RF beacon proximity, achieving a prediction accuracy of 86\% with 16 RF beacons.</description>

      <title>Restricting Voltage Deviation of DC Microgrids with Critical and Ordinary Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricting bus voltage deviation is crucial for normal operation of multi-bus DC microgrids, yet it has received insufficient attention due to the conflict between two main control objectives in DC microgrids, i.e., voltage regulation and current sharing. By revealing a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving these two objectives, this paper proposes a compromised distributed control algorithm, which regulates the voltage deviation of all buses by relaxing the accuracy of current sharing. Moreover, for a class of DC Microgrids consisting of both critical nodes and ordinary nodes, this paper proposes a distributed control algorithm that restricts the voltage deviation of critical nodes and simultaneously keeps the current sharing of ordinary nodes. This algorithm also works under plug-and-play settings. Simulations illustrate our theory.</description>

      <title>Coverage Path Planning for Thermal Interface Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal management of power electronics and Electronic Control Units is crucial in times of increasing power densities and limited assembly space. Electric and autonomous vehicles are a prominent application field. Thermal Interface Materials are used to transfer heat from a semiconductor to a heatsink. They are applied along a dispense path onto the semiconductor and spread over its entire surface once the heatsink is joined. To plan this application path, design engineers typically perform an iterative trial-and-error procedure of elaborate simulations and manual experiments. We propose a fully automated optimization approach, which clearly outperforms the current manual path planning and respects all relevant manufacturing constraints. An optimum dispense path increases the reliability of the thermal interface and makes the manufacturing more sustainable by reducing material waste. We show results on multiple real products from automotive series production, including an experimental validation on actual series manufacturing equipment.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Planning of Ventilation Systems: Optimising for Life-Cycle Costs and Acoustic Comfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing significance of energy efficiency in the building sector necessitates innovative planning to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. With the rise in mechanically ventilated buildings, traditional sequential planning methods, which first ensure outdoor air supply before addressing acoustics, are being reassessed due to their risk for suboptimal solutions. This study introduces a holistic algorithmic methodology for ventilation system design to minimise life-cycle costs while ensuring acoustically feasible solutions. Utilising discrete mathematics, the approach models components' impact on airflow, acoustics, power consumption, and costs, across multiple load cases, culminating in a 2-stage stochastic Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program. A case study demonstrates the methodology's applicability and the trade-off between energy efficiency and noise levels, highlighting its potential for more complex buildings. This integrated approach marks a significant advancement in ventilation system optimisation, promoting more holistic and efficient building designs while allowing for a more transparent decision-making.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Event-triggered Control of Nonlinear System with Full State Constraints and Disturbance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on the problem of adaptive tracking control for a specific type of nonlinear system that is subject to full-state constraints via a hybrid event-triggered control (HETC) strategy. With the auxiliary system, we proposed a 'log' function to deal with the full-state constraint. Additionally, a disturbance observer (DO) is constructed to handle the unmeasurable external disturbance. Then, by employing radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and a first-order differentiator, an opportune backstepping design procedure is given to avoid the problem of "explosion of complexity". The HETC strategy, including the fixed and relative threshold, is presented to provide more flexibility in balancing the system performances and network burdens. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aforementioned control scheme, a simulation example is presented to validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Safety Controllers Through Learning Deep Inverse Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier certificates have proven effective in formally guaranteeing the safety of the control systems. However, designing a control barrier certificate is a time-consuming and computationally expensive endeavor that requires expert input in the form of domain knowledge and mathematical maturity. Additionally, when a system undergoes slight changes, the new controller and its correctness certificate need to be recomputed, incurring similar computational challenges as those faced during the design of the original controller. Prior approaches have utilized transfer learning to transfer safety guarantees in the form of a barrier certificate while maintaining the control invariant. Unfortunately, in practical settings, the source and the target environments often deviate substantially in their control inputs, rendering the aforementioned approach impractical. To address this challenge, we propose integrating \emph{inverse dynamics} -- a neural network that suggests required action given a desired successor state -- of the target system with the barrier certificate of the source system to provide formal proof of safety. In addition, we propose a validity condition that, when met, guarantees correctness of the controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Sampling-Based Algorithm for Stability Analysis of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For complex nonlinear systems, it is challenging to design algorithms that are fast, scalable, and give an accurate approximation of the stability region. This paper proposes a sampling-based approach to address these challenges. By extending the parametrization of quadratic Lyapunov functions with the system dynamics and formulating an $\ell_1$ optimization to maximize the invariant set over a grid of the state space, we arrive at a computationally efficient algorithm that estimates the domain of attraction (DOA) of nonlinear systems accurately by using only linear programming. The scalability of the Lyapunov function synthesis is further improved by combining the algorithm with ADMM-based parallelization. To resolve the inherent approximative nature of grid-based techniques, a small-scale nonlinear optimization is proposed. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art solutions on several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Differential-Algebraic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems often faces numerous data-related challenges. A fundamental requirement is the existence of a unique set of parameters for a chosen model structure, an issue commonly referred to as identifiability. Although this problem is well studied for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), few studies have focused on the more general class of systems described by differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Examples of DAEs include dynamical systems with algebraic equations representing conservation laws or approximating fast dynamics. This work introduces a novel identifiability test for models characterized by nonlinear DAEs. Unlike previous approaches, our test only requires prior knowledge of the system equations and does not need nonlinear transformation, index reduction, or numerical integration of the DAEs. We employed our identifiability analysis across a diverse range of DAE models, illustrating how system identifiability depends on the choices of sensors, experimental conditions, and model structures. Given the added challenges involved in identifying DAEs when compared to ODEs, we anticipate that our findings will have broad applicability and contribute significantly to the development and validation of data-driven methods for DAEs and other structure-preserving models.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient predictive control for connected, automated driving under localization uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) for energy-efficient urban road driving for connected, automated vehicles. The proposed MPC aims to minimize total energy consumption by controlling the vehicle's longitudinal motion on roads with traffic lights and preceding vehicles. Its terminal cost function and terminal constraints are learned from data, which consists of the closed-loop state and input trajectories. The terminal cost function represents the remaining energy-to-spend starting from a given terminal state. The terminal constraints are designed to ensure that the controlled vehicle timely crosses the upcoming traffic light, adheres to traffic laws, and accounts for the preceding vehicles. We validate the effectiveness of our method through both simulations and real-world vehicle experiments, demonstrating $\textbf{19\%}$ improvement in average energy consumption compared to conventional approaches that involve solving a long-horizon optimal control problem for speed planning and employing a separate controller for speed tracking.</description>

      <title>IOT Based Environment Monitoring System Using</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project a modern approach and technology are adopted for monitoring the environmental conditions in a particular location. This system is efficient in retrieving the environmental data from the device because the environmental conditions change spontaneously based on different atmospheric conditions. There is a need for us to pay close attention to our environment as human beings the weather has an effect on our physical and psychological health conditions. Even if we do not consider any reason to monitor our environment our health condition is enough to motivate us to be concerned about our environmental situation. So environmental monitoring system makes it easier for us to have access to this data at will by updating us about current environmental conditions and information from the weather station using apps or web pages. IoT is known as a system that connects the world together and is the way to disseminate information so we build the system on IoT and use it as a central point for monitoring collating and managing our data. This project has designed an environmental system based on a microcontroller Board EPS32 and Blynk app. This is an IoT-based project that measures environmental data on temperature and humidity.</description>

      <title>A hybrid systems framework for data-based adaptive control of linear time-varying systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the data-driven stabilization of discrete-time linear time-varying systems. The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Advanced Safety Filter for Smooth Transient Operation of a Battery Energy Storage System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we implement an advanced safety filter to smoothly limit the current of an inverter-based Battery Energy Storage System. The task involves finding suitable Control Barrier Function and Control Lyapunov Function via Sum-of-Squares optimization to certify the system's safety during grid transients. In contrast to the conventional safety filter, the advanced safety filter not only provides a safety certificate but also achieves finite-time convergence to a nominal region. Within this region, the action of the nominal control, i.e. the Enhanced Direct Power Control, remains unaltered by the safety filter. The advanced safety filter is implemented using a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program, providing the capability to also encode quadratic input constraints. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of the implementation through simulations involving a load step at the Point of Common Coupling, and we compare the outcomes with those obtained using a standard vector current controller.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of a Roaming Wireless Safety Emergency Stop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern manufacturing is characterized by a high degree of automation, with autonomous systems also frequently being used. In such environments human intervention in the event of malfunctions or maintenance becomes a rare but also necessary task. When human workers are no longer an integral part of the production process, but only intervene when necessary, e.g., in the case of unexpected machine behavior, appropriate safety solutions will become even more important. This work describes a wireless communication system enabling a flexible and safe emergency stop function for multiple automation cells. A portable emergency stop switch allows seamless transition between different wireless cells, ensuring functional safety. The communication protocol combines IO-Link Wireless features with the safety requirements already implemented in IO-Link Safety. Security requirements are fulfilled through encryption and authentication. The IO-Link Wireless roaming functionality is used to extend the system across several manufacturing cells. An experimental setup confirms the suitability of the system for various applications. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the handover mechanism and evaluate the potential of the system to improve flexibility, availability and security in dynamic production environments. Future extensions could include the use of AI based evaluation of the radio signals for an intelligent cell handover.</description>

      <title>K-factor Evaluation in a Hybrid Reverberation Chamber plus CATR OTA Testing Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates achieving diverse K-factors using a Reverberation Chamber (RC) with a Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) system. It explores six hybrid "RC plus CATR" configurations involving different excitations of the Rich Isotropic Multipath (RIMP) field and CATR-generated plane waves, with some setups including absorbers. A fixed horn antenna points towards the CATR in all configurations. The study found that the null hypothesis of Rayleigh or Rician probability distributions for the received signal envelope could not be rejected, with RIMP setups primarily conforming to Rayleigh distribution and all setups showing Rician distribution. Various K-factors were obtained, but no generalizable method for achieving the desired K-factor was identified. The paper also estimates the K-factor as a function of frequency in the 24.25-29.5 GHz band. Smaller K-factors exhibit larger fluctuations, while larger K-factors remain relatively stable, with consistent fluctuations across the frequency range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of reverberation chambers for TRP measurements of beamformed radiation by phased arrays at mmWave frequencies. First, the received power was verified by the one-sample K-S GoF test to follow the exponential probability distribution. Different numbers of samples and stirrers' positions were considered. Second, we showed that the effective number of independent samples is different depending on the number of samples and stirrers' positions. Third, the beamforming TRP estimates are presented for all beams, analyzing the statistical significance of the observed differences with a selection of samplings.</description>

      <title>High Performance P300 Spellers Using GPT2 Word Prediction With Cross-Subject Training</title>

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) severely impairs patients' ability to communicate, often leading to a decline in their quality of life within a few years of diagnosis. The P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI) offers an alternative communication method by interpreting a subject's EEG response to characters presented on a grid interface.
  This paper addresses the common speed limitations encountered in training efficient P300-based multi-subject classifiers by introducing innovative "across-subject" classifiers. We leverage a combination of the second-generation Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT2) and Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize stimuli and suggest word completion choices based on typing history. Additionally, we employ a multi-layered smoothing technique to accommodate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
  Through extensive simulations involving random sampling of EEG data from subjects, we demonstrate significant speed enhancements in typing passages containing rare and OOV words. These optimizations result in approximately 10% improvement in character-level typing speed and up to 40% improvement in multi-word prediction. We demonstrate that augmenting standard row/column highlighting techniques with layered word prediction yields close-to-optimal performance.
  Furthermore, we explore both "within-subject" and "across-subject" training techniques, showing that speed improvements are consistent across both approaches.</description>

      <title>Skills Composition Framework for Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical Production Modules</title>

Abstract: While the benefits of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are well-known, there are still challenges to their development, including, among others, a modular software architecture that enables rapid reconfiguration without much reprogramming effort. Skill-based engineering improves software modularity and increases the reconfiguration potential of RMS. Nevertheless, a skills' composition framework with a focus on frequent and rapid software changes is still missing. The Behavior trees (BTs) framework is a novel approach, which enables intuitive design of modular hierarchical control structures. BTs have been mostly explored from the AI and robotics perspectives, and little work has been done in investigating their potential for composing skills in the manufacturing domain. This paper proposes a framework for skills' composition and execution in skill-based reconfigurable cyber-physical production modules (RCPPMs). It is based on distributed BTs and provides good integration between low-level devices' specific code and AI-based task-oriented frameworks. We have implemented the provided models for the IEC 61499-based distributed automation controllers to show the instantiation of the proposed framework with the specific industrial technology and enable its evaluation by the automation community.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware DRL for Autonomous Vehicle Crowd Navigation in Shared Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe, socially compliant, and efficient navigation of low-speed autonomous vehicles (AVs) in pedestrian-rich environments necessitates considering pedestrians' future positions and interactions with the vehicle and others. Despite the inevitable uncertainties associated with pedestrians' predicted trajectories due to their unobserved states (e.g., intent), existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for crowd navigation often neglect these uncertainties when using predicted trajectories to guide policy learning. This omission limits the usability of predictions when diverging from ground truth. This work introduces an integrated prediction and planning approach that incorporates the uncertainties of predicted pedestrian states in the training of a model-free DRL algorithm. A novel reward function encourages the AV to respect pedestrians' personal space, decrease speed during close approaches, and minimize the collision probability with their predicted paths. Unlike previous DRL methods, our model, designed for AV operation in crowded spaces, is trained in a novel simulation environment that reflects realistic pedestrian behaviour in a shared space with vehicles. Results show a 40% decrease in collision rate and a 15% increase in minimum distance to pedestrians compared to the state of the art model that does not account for prediction uncertainty. Additionally, the approach outperforms model predictive control methods that incorporate the same prediction uncertainties in terms of both performance and computational time, while producing trajectories closer to human drivers in similar scenarios.</description>

      <title>Formally Verifying Deep Reinforcement Learning Controllers with Lyapunov Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for generating agents that control autonomous systems. However, the "black box" nature of DRL agents limits their deployment in real-world safety-critical applications. A promising approach for providing strong guarantees on an agent's behavior is to use Neural Lyapunov Barrier (NLB) certificates, which are learned functions over the system whose properties indirectly imply that an agent behaves as desired. However, NLB-based certificates are typically difficult to learn and even more difficult to verify, especially for complex systems. In this work, we present a novel method for training and verifying NLB-based certificates for discrete-time systems. Specifically, we introduce a technique for certificate composition, which simplifies the verification of highly-complex systems by strategically designing a sequence of certificates. When jointly verified with neural network verification engines, these certificates provide a formal guarantee that a DRL agent both achieves its goals and avoids unsafe behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for certificate filtering, which significantly simplifies the process of producing formally verified certificates. We demonstrate the merits of our approach with a case study on providing safety and liveness guarantees for a DRL-controlled spacecraft.</description>

Abstract: Communication and position sensing are among the most important capabilities for swarm robots to interact with their peers and perform tasks collaboratively. However, the hardware required to facilitate communication and position sensing is often too complicated, expensive, and bulky to be carried on swarm robots. Here we present Maneuverable Piccolissimo 3 (MP3), a minimalist, single motor drone capable of executing inter-robot communication via infrared light and triangulation-based sensing of relative bearing, distance, and elevation using message arrival time. Thanks to its novel design, MP3 can communicate with peers and localize itself using simple components, keeping its size and mass small and making it inherently safe for human interaction. Here we present the hardware and software design of MP3 and demonstrate its capability to localize itself, fly stably and maneuver in the environment using peer-to-peer communication and sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Navigation of a Robotic Fish Swimming Across the Vortical Flow Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigating efficiently across vortical flow fields presents a significant challenge in various robotic applications. The dynamic and unsteady nature of vortical flows often disturbs the control of underwater robots, complicating their operation in hydrodynamic environments. Conventional control methods, which depend on accurate modeling, fail in these settings due to the complexity of fluid-structure interactions (FSI) caused by unsteady hydrodynamics. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, trained in a data-driven manner, to enable efficient navigation of a robotic fish swimming across vortical flows. Our proposed algorithm incorporates the LSTM architecture and uses several recent consecutive observations as the state to address the issue of partial observation, often due to sensor limitations. We present a numerical study of navigation within a Karman vortex street, created by placing a stationary cylinder in a uniform flow, utilizing the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). The aim is to train the robotic fish to discover efficient navigation policies, enabling it to reach a designated target point across the Karman vortex street from various initial positions. After training, the fish demonstrates the ability to rapidly reach the target from different initial positions, showcasing the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed algorithm. Analysis of the results reveals that the robotic fish can leverage velocity gains and pressure differences induced by the vortices to reach the target, underscoring the potential of our proposed algorithm in enhancing navigation in complex hydrodynamic environments.</description>

      <title>On discount functions for economic model predictive control without terminal conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate discounted economic model predictive control (E-MPC) schemes without terminal conditions in scenarios where the optimal operating behavior is a periodic orbit. For such a setting, it is known that a linearly discounted stage cost guarantees asymptotic stability of any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal orbit if the prediction horizon is sufficiently long. However, in some examples very long prediction horizons are needed to achieve the desired performance. In this work, we extend these results by providing the same qualitative stability guarantees for a large class of discount functions. Numerical examples illustrate the influence of the discount function and show that with suitable discounting we can achieve significantly better performance than the linearly discounted E-MPC, even for short prediction horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the rapid improvement of the detectors at high-energy physics experiments, the need for real-time data monitoring systems has become imperative. The significance of these systems lies in their ability to display experiment status, steer software and hardware instrumentation, and provide alarms, thus enabling researchers to manage their experiments better. However, researchers typically build most data monitoring systems as standalone in-house solutions that cannot be reused for other experiments or future upgrades. We present BORA (personalized collaBORAtive data display), a lightweight browser-based monitoring system that supports diverse protocols and is built specifically for customizable visualization of complex data, which we standardize via video streaming. We show how absolute positioning layout and visual overlay background can address the diverse data display design requirements. Using the client-server architecture, we enable support for diverse communication protocols, with the server component responsible for parsing the incoming data. We integrate the Jupyter Notebook as part of our ecosystem to address the limitations of the web-based framework, providing a foundation to leverage scripting capabilities and integrate popular AI frameworks. Since video streaming is a core component of our framework, we evaluate viable approaches to streaming protocols like HLS, WebRTC, and MPEG-Websocket. The study explores the implications for our use case, highlighting its potential to transform data visualization and decision-making processes.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic data-driven Digital Twins (DDTs) can enable informed decision-making and provide an optimisation platform for the underlying system. By leveraging principles of Dynamic Data-Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS), DDTs can formulate computational modalities for feedback loops, model updates and decision-making, including autonomous ones. However, understanding autonomous decision-making often requires technical and domain-specific knowledge. This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to provide an explainability platform for DDTs, generating natural language explanations of the system's decision-making by leveraging domain-specific knowledge bases. A case study from smart agriculture is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.08599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) commonly appear in systems, stability, and control applications. Many analysis and synthesis problems in these areas can be solved as feasibility or optimization problems subject to LMI constraints. Although most well-known LMI properties and manipulation tricks, such as the Schur complement and the congruence transformation, can be found in standard references, many useful LMI properties are scattered throughout the literature. The purpose of this document is to collect and organize properties, tricks, and applications related to LMIs from a number of references together in a single document. In this sense, the document can be thought of as an "LMI encyclopedia" or "LMI cookbook." Proofs of the properties presented in this document are not included when they can be found in the cited references in the interest of brevity. Illustrative examples are included whenever necessary to fully explain a certain property. Multiple equivalent forms of LMIs are often presented to give the reader a choice of which form may be best suited for a particular problem at hand. The equivalency of some of the LMIs in this document may be straightforward to more experienced readers, but the authors believe that some readers may benefit from the presentation of multiple equivalent LMIs.</description>

      <title>Frequency Response Analysis for Reset Control Systems: Application to Predict Precision of Motion Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency response analysis describes the steady-state responses of a system to sinusoidal inputs at different frequencies, providing control engineers with an effective tool for designing control systems in the frequency domain. However, conducting this analysis for closed-loop reset systems is challenging due to system nonlinearity. This paper addresses this challenge through two key contributions. First, it introduces novel analysis methods for both open-loop and closed-loop reset control systems at steady states. These methods decompose the frequency responses of reset systems into base-linear and nonlinear components. Second, building upon this analysis, the paper develops closed-loop higher-order sinusoidal-input describing functions for reset control systems at steady states. These functions facilitate the analysis of frequency-domain properties, establish a connection between open-loop and closed-loop analysis, and enable the prediction of time-domain performance for reset systems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are successfully validated through simulations and experiments conducted on a reset Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controlled precision motion system.</description>

      <title>Flexible nuclear power and fluctuating renewables? -- A techno-economic analysis for decarbonized energy systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many governments are considering constructing new nuclear power plants to support the decarbonization of the energy system. On the one hand, dispatchable nuclear plants can complement fluctuating generation from wind and PV. On the other hand, escalating construction costs and times raise economic concerns. In this paper, we extensively review construction costs and times. On this basis, we apply a detailed multi-vector energy model to analyze the cost-efficient share of nuclear power in fully decarbonized energy systems, i.e., energy systems that do not utilize any fossil fuels. Our analysis finds that even if, reversing the historical trend, overnight construction costs of nuclear half to 4,000 US-$2018 per kW and construction times remain below ten years, the cost-efficient share of nuclear power in European electricity generation is only around 10%. The analysis still omits the social costs of nuclear power, such as the risk of accidents or waste management. Nuclear plants must operate inflexibly and at capacity factors close to 90% to recover their investment costs, implying that operational flexibility-even if technically possible-is not economically viable. As a result, grid infrastructure, flexible demand in multi-energy systems, and storage are more efficient options for integrating fluctuating wind and photovoltaic generation.</description>

Abstract: During planar motion, contact surfaces exhibit a coupling between tangential and rotational friction forces. This paper proposes planar friction models grounded in the LuGre model and limit surface theory. First, distributed planar extended state models are proposed and the Elasto-Plastic model is extended for multi-dimensional friction. Subsequently, we derive a reduced planar friction model, coupled with a pre-calculated limit surface, that offers reduced computational cost. The limit surface approximation through an ellipsoid is discussed. The properties of the planar friction models are assessed in various simulations, demonstrating that the reduced planar friction model achieves comparable performance to the distributed model while exhibiting ~80 times lower computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the structural controllability of switched linear continuous-time systems. It first identifies a gap in the proof for a pivotal criterion for the structural controllability of switched linear systems in the literature. To address this void, we develop novel graph-theoretic concepts, such as multi-layer dynamic graphs, generalized stems/buds, and generalized cacti, and based on them, provide a comprehensive proof for this criterion. Our approach also induces a new, generalized cactus based graph-theoretic criterion for structural controllability. This not only extends Lin's cactus-based graph-theoretic condition to switched systems for the first time, but also provides a lower bound for the generic dimension of controllable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Two stage Robust Nash Bargaining based Energy Trading between Hydrogen-enriched Gas and Active Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integration of emerging hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) distribution network with active distribution net-work (ADN) provides huge latent flexibility on consuming re-newable energies. However, paucity of energy trading mechanism risks the stable earnings of the flexibility for both entities, especially when rising highly-efficient solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are pioneered to interface gas and electricity. To fill the gap, a two-stage robust Nash bargaining strategy is pro-posed. In the first stage, a privacy-preserved Nash Bargaining based on the ADMM is applied to clear energy trading between the two autonomous entities, i.e., ADN and gas distribution network (GDN). Via robust dispatch of configured energy storage in ADN, the next stage de-risks ADN profit collapse from transaction biases, caused by forecasting errors of distributed energy resources. C&amp;CG is finally utilized to loop the two stages. The convergence of the entire energy trading strategy is theoretically proved. As such, sustain-able returns from the integration of ADN and GDN bridged by SOFC and HCNG are facilitated. Numerical studies indicate that, the proposed cooperative strategy reaps a stable social welfare of nearly 1.6% to total cost, and benefit-steady situations for both ADN and GDN, even in the worst case.</description>

We prove theoretically that complex droop control, as a state-of-the-art grid-forming control, always possesses steady-state equilibria whereas classical droop control does not. We provide quantitative conditions for complex droop control maintaining transient stability (global asymptotic stability) under grid disturbances, which is beyond the well-established local (non-global) stability for classical droop control. For the transient instability of complex droop control, we reveal that the unstable trajectories are bounded, manifesting as limit cycle oscillations. Moreover, we extend our stability results from second-order grid-forming control dynamics to full-order system dynamics that additionally encompass both circuit electromagnetic transients and inner-loop dynamics. Our theoretical results contribute an insightful understanding of the transient stability and instability of complex droop control and offer practical guidelines for parameter tuning and stability guarantees.</description>

Abstract: Effective control requires knowledge of the process dynamics to guide the system toward desired states. In many control applications this knowledge is expressed mathematically or through data-driven models, however, as complexity grows obtaining a satisfactory mathematical representation is increasingly difficult. Further, many data-driven approaches consist of abstract internal representations that may have no obvious connection to the underlying dynamics and control, or, require extensive model design and training. Here, we remove these constraints by demonstrating model predictive control from generalized state space embedding of the process dynamics providing a data-driven, explainable method for control of nonlinear, complex systems. Generalized embedding and model predictive control are demonstrated on nonlinear dynamics generated by an agent based model of 1200 interacting agents. The method is generally applicable to any type of controller and dynamic system representable in a state space.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Regret Analysis of Adaptive Linear Quadratic Control with Model Misspecification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strategy of pre-training a large model on a diverse dataset, then fine-tuning for a particular application has yielded impressive results in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic control. This strategy has vast potential in adaptive control, where it is necessary to rapidly adapt to changing conditions with limited data. Toward concretely understanding the benefit of pre-training for adaptive control, we study the adaptive linear quadratic control problem in the setting where the learner has prior knowledge of a collection of basis matrices for the dynamics. This basis is misspecified in the sense that it cannot perfectly represent the dynamics of the underlying data generating process. We propose an algorithm that uses this prior knowledge, and prove upper bounds on the expected regret after $T$ interactions with the system. In the regime where $T$ is small, the upper bounds are dominated by a term that scales with either $\texttt{poly}(\log T)$ or $\sqrt{T}$, depending on the prior knowledge available to the learner. When $T$ is large, the regret is dominated by a term that grows with $\delta T$, where $\delta$ quantifies the level of misspecification. This linear term arises due to the inability to perfectly estimate the underlying dynamics using the misspecified basis, and is therefore unavoidable unless the basis matrices are also adapted online. However, it only dominates for large $T$, after the sublinear terms arising due to the error in estimating the weights for the basis matrices become negligible. We provide simulations that validate our analysis. Our simulations also show that offline data from a collection of related systems can be used as part of a pre-training stage to estimate a misspecified dynamics basis, which is in turn used by our adaptive controller.</description>

      <title>Pursuit Winning Strategies for Reach-Avoid Games with Polygonal Obstacles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiplayer reach-avoid differential game in the presence of general polygonal obstacles that block the players' motions. The pursuers cooperate to protect a convex region from the evaders who try to reach the region. We propose a multiplayer onsite and close-to-goal (MOCG) pursuit strategy that can tell and achieve an increasing lower bound on the number of guaranteed defeated evaders. This pursuit strategy fuses the subgame outcomes for multiple pursuers against one evader with hierarchical optimal task allocation in the receding-horizon manner. To determine the qualitative subgame outcomes that who is the game winner, we construct three pursuit winning regions and strategies under which the pursuers guarantee to win against the evader, regardless of the unknown evader strategy. First, we utilize the expanded Apollonius circles and propose the onsite pursuit winning that achieves the capture in finite time. Second, we introduce convex goal-covering polygons (GCPs) and propose the close-to-goal pursuit winning for the pursuers whose visibility region contains the whole protected region, and the goal-visible property will be preserved afterwards. Third, we employ Euclidean shortest paths (ESPs) and construct a pursuit winning region and strategy for the non-goal-visible pursuers, where the pursuers are firstly steered to positions with goal visibility along ESPs. In each horizon, the hierarchical optimal task allocation maximizes the number of defeated evaders and consists of four sequential matchings: capture, enhanced, non-dominated and closest matchings. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Activating the Flexibility in Distribution systems via a Unified Quantification Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective quantification of the cost of flexibility and its contribution to the system is essential for activating the flexibility of the numerous distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems operation. We first propose a unified flexibility cost quantification method for heterogonous DERs based on the adjustment ranges in both power and accumulated energy consumption. Compared with traditional power range-based approaches, the proposed method can reflect the potential inconvenience caused to different DER users by flexibility activation and directly capture the time-dependent characteristics of DER's flexibility regions. Extending to the aggregator level, we then propose a flexibility cost formulation aligned with the aggregated flexibility model. On this basis, a model for distribution system operators (DSOs) is proposed to coordinate the DER aggregators' participation in the transmission system operation for energy arbitrage and ancillary services provision. This model derives a method for quantifying the contribution of each aggregator's activated flexibility region to the DSO's revenue from the transmission system, which is used to allocate the revenue to each aggregator while ensuring that the DSO is non-profit. Numerical tests on the IEEE 33-node distribution system validate the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: We first propose systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for linear time-invariant systems, under standard assumptions involving observability and interval bounds on the initial condition and disturbances. Historically, such designs rely on transformations with certain limitations into a form that is Metzler (for continuous time) or non-negative (for discrete time). We show that they can be effectively replaced with a linear time-invariant transformation that can be easily computed offline. Then, we propose the extension to the time-varying setting, where conventional transformations lack guaranteed outcomes. Academic examples are presented to illustrate our methods.</description>

Abstract: Many contemporary applications, including smart homes and autonomous vehicles, rely on the Internet of Things technology. While cloud computing provides a multitude of valuable services for these applications, it generally imposes constraints on latency-sensitive applications due to the significant propagation delays. As a complementary technique to cloud computing, edge computing situates computing resources closer to the data sources, which reduces the latency and simultaneously alleviates the bandwidth pressure for the cloud and enhances data security. While edge computing offers significant advantages, it also presents significant challenges in access control -- a critical component for safeguarding data. For instance, it is crucial to implement access control mechanisms that are both effective and efficient on resource-constrained devices, ensuring high security without compromising the inherent low latency benefits of edge computing. These challenges drive the development of innovative access control solutions tailored to meet the unique requirements of edge computing environments. We classify related references from the perspectives of multiple data lifecycles (including data collection, storage, and usage), which thoroughly investigates the access control techniques and helps readers understand them systematically. Finally, we reflect on the classification and envisage future research directions.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Sampling Approach to Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal stochastic sampling approach to privacy, in which a sensor observes a process which is correlated to private information, and a sampler decides to keep or discard the sensor's observations. The kept samples are shared with an adversary who might attempt to infer the private process. The privacy leakages are captured with the mutual information between the private process and sampler's output. We cast the optimal sampling design as an optimization problem that (i) minimizes the reconstruction error of the observed process using the sampler's output, (ii) and reduces privacy leakages. We first show the optimal reconstruction is obtained by solving a one-step optimization problem at each time step. We derive the optimality equations of the sampler for a general processes via the dynamic decomposition method, and show the sampler controls adversary's belief about the private input. Also, we propose a simplified design for linear Gaussian processes by restricting the sampling policy to a special collection. We show that the optimal reconstruction of states, the belief state and the optimization objective can be analytically expressed based on a conditional mean and covariance matrix. We develop an numerical algorithm to optimize the sampling and reconstruction policies based on the implicit function theorem. Finally, we verify our design and show its capabilities in state reconstruction, privacy protection and data size reduction via simulations.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing Using Sparse Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Load balancing across parallel servers is an important class of congestion control problems that arises in service systems. An effective load balancer relies heavily on accurate, real-time congestion information to make routing decisions. However, obtaining such information can impose significant communication overheads, especially in demanding applications like those found in modern data centers.
  We introduce a framework for communication-aware load balancing and design new load balancing algorithms that perform exceptionally well even in scenarios with sparse communication patterns. Central to our approach is state approximation, where the load balancer first estimates server states through a communication protocol. Subsequently, it utilizes these approximate states within a load balancing algorithm to determine routing decisions.
  We demonstrate that by using a novel communication protocol, one can achieve accurate queue length approximation with sparse communication: for a maximal approximation error of x, the communication frequency only needs to be O(1/x^2). We further show, via a diffusion analysis, that a constant maximal approximation error is sufficient for achieving asymptotically optimal performance. Taken together, these results therefore demonstrate that highly performant load balancing is possible with very little communication. Through simulations, we observe that the proposed designs match or surpass the performance of state-of-the-art load balancing algorithms while drastically reducing communication rates by up to 90%.</description>

      <title>Minimax-Optimal Reward-Agnostic Exploration in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies reward-agnostic exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) -- a scenario where the learner is unware of the reward functions during the exploration stage -- and designs an algorithm that improves over the state of the art. More precisely, consider a finite-horizon inhomogeneous Markov decision process with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and horizon length $H$, and suppose that there are no more than a polynomial number of given reward functions of interest. By collecting an order of \begin{align*}
  \frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2} \text{ sample episodes (up to log factor)} \end{align*} without guidance of the reward information, our algorithm is able to find $\varepsilon$-optimal policies for all these reward functions, provided that $\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small. This forms the first reward-agnostic exploration scheme in this context that achieves provable minimax optimality. Furthermore, once the sample size exceeds $\frac{S^2AH^3}{\varepsilon^2}$ episodes (up to log factor), our algorithm is able to yield $\varepsilon$ accuracy for arbitrarily many reward functions (even when they are adversarially designed), a task commonly dubbed as ``reward-free exploration.'' The novelty of our algorithm design draws on insights from offline RL: the exploration scheme attempts to maximize a critical reward-agnostic quantity that dictates the performance of offline RL, while the policy learning paradigm leverages ideas from sample-optimal offline RL paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network, where an $N$-level atom is coupled with a cavity and the cavity is also coupled with single or multiple parallel waveguides. When the atom is initialized at the highest energy level, it can emit multiple photons into the cavity, and the photons can be further transmitted to the waveguides and re-interact with the cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system. The transmission of photons in the waveguide can construct a feedback channel with a delay determined by the length of the waveguide. We model the dynamics of the atomic and photonic states of the cavity-QED system as a linear control system with delay. By tuning the control parameters such as the coupling strengths among the atom, cavity and waveguide, the eigenstates of the quantum system can be exponentially stable or unstable, and the exponential stability of the linear quantum control system with delay is related with the generation of single- and multi-photon states. Besides, when the cavity-QED system is coupled with multiple parallel waveguides, the emitted photons oscillate among different waveguides and the stability of quantum states is influenced by the feedback loop length and coupling strengths among waveguides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense traffic scenarios, ensuring safety while keeping high task performance for autonomous driving is a critical challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a computationally-efficient spatiotemporal receding horizon control (ST-RHC) scheme to generate a safe, dynamically feasible, energy-efficient trajectory in control space, where different driving tasks in dense traffic can be achieved with high accuracy and safety in real time. In particular, an embodied spatiotemporal safety barrier module considering proactive interactions is devised to mitigate the effects of inaccuracies resulting from the trajectory prediction of other vehicles. Subsequently, the motion planning and control problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, which favorably facilitates the effective use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers in conjunction with multiple shooting. The effectiveness of the proposed ST-RHC scheme is demonstrated through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real-world traffic datasets under dense traffic, and the attendant outcome of superior performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and safety is achieved.</description>

Abstract: Simulation to reality (sim2real) transfer from a dynamics and controls perspective usually involves re-tuning or adapting the designed algorithms to suit real-world operating conditions, which often violates the performance guarantees established originally. This work presents a generalizable framework for achieving reliable sim2real transfer of autonomy-oriented control systems using multi-model multi-objective robust optimal control synthesis, which lends well to uncertainty handling and disturbance rejection with theoretical guarantees. Particularly, this work is centered around a novel actuation-redundant scaled autonomous vehicle called Nigel, with independent all-wheel drive and independent all-wheel steering architecture, whose enhanced configuration space bodes well for robust control applications. To this end, we present the mechatronic design, dynamics modeling, parameter identification, and robust stabilizing as well as tracking control of Nigel using the proposed framework, with exhaustive experimentation and benchmarking in simulation as well as real-world settings.</description>

Abstract: Quadrotors are increasingly used in the evolving field of aerial robotics for their agility and mechanical simplicity. However, inherent uncertainties, such as aerodynamic effects coupled with quadrotors' operation in dynamically changing environments, pose significant challenges for traditional, nominal model-based control designs. We propose a multi-task meta-learning method called Encoder-Prototype-Decoder (EPD), which has the advantage of effectively balancing shared and distinctive representations across diverse training tasks. Subsequently, we integrate the EPD model into a model predictive control problem (Proto-MPC) to enhance the quadrotor's ability to adapt and operate across a spectrum of dynamically changing tasks with an efficient online implementation. We validate the proposed method in simulations, which demonstrates Proto-MPC's robust performance in trajectory tracking of a quadrotor being subject to static and spatially varying side winds.</description>

      <title>Online Algorithm for Node Feature Forecasting in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an online algorithm mspace for forecasting node features in temporal graphs, which captures spatial cross-correlation among different nodes as well as the temporal auto-correlation within a node. The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Comparative evaluations against various baselines, including temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs at par with the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent performance across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over TGNN models that require abundant training samples to effectively learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales linearly with the number of forecast steps $q$ as $\mathcal{O}(q)$. For an asymptotically large number of nodes $n$, and timesteps $T$, the computational complexity of mspace grows linearly with both $n$, and $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nT)$, while its space complexity remains constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We compare the performance of various mspace variants against ten recent TGNN baselines and two classical baselines, ARIMA and the Kalman filter across ten real-world datasets. Additionally, we propose a technique to generate synthetic datasets to aid in evaluating node feature forecasting methods, with the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research. Lastly, we have investigate the interpretability of different mspace variants by analyzing model parameters alongside dataset characteristics to derive model and data-centric insights.</description>

      <title>Restless Bandit Problem with Rewards Generated by a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is a fundamental problem encountered frequently and can be formulated as a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. In the problem, the learner interacts with an environment by choosing an action at each round, where a round is an instance of an interaction. In response, the environment reveals a reward, which is sampled from a stochastic process, to the learner. The goal of the learner is to maximize cumulative reward. In this work, we assume that the rewards are the inner product of an action vector and a state vector generated by a linear Gaussian dynamical system. To predict the reward for each action, we propose a method that takes a linear combination of previously observed rewards for predicting each action's next reward. We show that, regardless of the sequence of previous actions chosen, the reward sampled for any previously chosen action can be used for predicting another action's future reward, i.e. the reward sampled for action 1 at round $t-1$ can be used for predicting the reward for action $2$ at round $t$. This is accomplished by designing a modified Kalman filter with a matrix representation that can be learned for reward prediction. Numerical evaluations are carried out on a set of linear Gaussian dynamical systems and are compared with 2 other well-known stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Time-Critical Wilderness Search And Rescue Using Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional search and rescue methods in wilderness areas can be time-consuming and have limited coverage. Drones offer a faster and more flexible solution, but optimizing their search paths is crucial. This paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to create efficient search missions for drones in wilderness environments. Our approach leverages a priori data about the search area and the missing person in the form of a probability distribution map. This allows the deep reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal flight paths that maximize the probability of finding the missing person quickly. Experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement in search times compared to traditional coverage planning and search planning algorithms. In one comparison, deep reinforcement learning is found to outperform other algorithms by over $160\%$, a difference that can mean life or death in real-world search operations. Additionally, unlike previous work, our approach incorporates a continuous action space enabled by cubature, allowing for more nuanced flight patterns.</description>
