      <title>Uplink RSMA Performance Analysis with Rate Adaptation: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a promising technique for efficient interference management in next-generation wireless networks. While most existing studies focus on downlink and single-cell designs, the modeling and analysis of uplink RSMA under large-scale deployments remain largely unexplored. On the basis of stochastic geometry (SG), this paper introduces a unified analytical framework that integrates finite modulation and coding scheme (MCS)-based rate adaptation. This framework jointly captures spatial interference coupling and discrete rate behavior to bridge theoretical tractability and practical realism. Within this framework, we derive tractable expressions for the conditional received rate (CRR), its spatial average, and higher-order statistics via the meta distribution, thereby quantifying both the mean and user-specific rate performance. Results show that the proposed unified framework not only generalizes existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) analyses but also provides new insights into how discrete rate adaptation reshapes interference dynamics and fairness in dense RSMA-enabled networks.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven 3D Semantic Spectrum Map: KE-VQ-Transformer Based UAV Semantic Communication and Map Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-native three-dimensional (3D) spectrum maps are crucial in spectrum monitoring for intelligent communication networks. However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE.</description>

      <title>Coding-Logic Correspondence: Turning Information and Communication Networks into Logical Formulae via Hypergraph Heyting Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using confusion hypergraphs (hyperconfusions) as a model of information. In contrast to the conventional approach using random variables, we can now perform conjunction, disjunction and implication of information, forming a Heyting algebra. Using the connection between Heyting algebra and intuitionistic logic, we can express the requirements of a communication network (e.g., network coding, index coding, Slepian-Wolf coding) as a logical formula, allowing us to use the hypergraph Heyting algebra to directly compute the optimal coding scheme. The optimal communication cost is simply given by the entropy of the hypergraph (within a logarithmic gap). This gives a surprising correspondence between coding settings and logical formulae, similar to the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and computer programs.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enabled Elastic Network Topology for Distributed ISAC Service Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional mobile networks, including both localized cell-centric and cooperative cell-free networks (CCN/CFN), are built upon rigid network topologies. However, neither architecture is adequate to flexibly support distributed integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) services, due to the increasing difficulty of aligning spatiotemporally distributed heterogeneous service demands with available radio resources. In this paper, we propose an elastic network topology (ENT) for distributed ISAC service provisioning, where multiple co-existing localized CCNs can be dynamically aggregated into CFNs with expanded boundaries for federated network operation. This topology elastically orchestrates localized CCN and federated CFN boundaries to balance signaling overhead and distributed resource utilization, thereby enabling efficient ISAC service provisioning. A two-phase operation protocol is then developed. In Phase I, each CCN autonomously classifies ISAC services as either local or federated and partitions its resources into dedicated and shared segments. In Phase II, each CCN employs its dedicated resources for local ISAC services, while the aggregated CFN consolidates shared resources from its constituent CCNs to cooperatively deliver federated services. Furthermore, we design a utility-to-signaling ratio (USR) to quantify the tradeoff between sensing/communication utility and signaling overhead. Consequently, a USR maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the network topology (i.e., service classification and CCN aggregation) and the allocation of dedicated and shared resources. However, this problem is challenging due to its distributed optimization nature and the absence of complete channel state information. To address this problem efficiently, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework with centralized training and decentralized execution.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Overfitting for Low-Complexity and Modality-Agnostic Joint Source-Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Implicit-JSCC, a novel overfitted joint source-channel coding paradigm that directly optimizes channel symbols and a lightweight neural decoder for each source. This instance-specific strategy eliminates the need for training datasets or pre-trained models, enabling a storage-free, modality-agnostic solution. As a low-complexity alternative, Implicit-JSCC achieves efficient image transmission with around 1000x lower decoding complexity, using as few as 607 model parameters and 641 multiplications per pixel. This overfitted design inherently addresses source generalizability and achieves state-of-the-art results in the high SNR regimes, underscoring its promise for future communication systems, especially streaming scenarios where one-time offline encoding supports multiple online decoding.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Kolmogorov Complexity of Binary Words with Empirical Entropy Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary word reflects both algorithmic structure and the empirical distribution of symbols appearing in the word. Words with symbol frequencies far from one half have smaller combinatorial richness and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin L\"of random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mediumband Wireless Communication Systems: A Concise Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the necessary procedures for accurately simulating digital wireless communication systems operating in the mediumband, aimed at both beginners and experts. In the research literature, digital wireless communication systems are typically simulated in the discrete-time complex baseband domain, where pulse shaping, upconversion, mixing, carrier synchronization, and symbol timing synchronization are often ignored. These assumptions are indeed sufficient in most cases, but to capture the essence of communication in the mediumband, certain physical layer (PHY) operations should be simulated in detail. In this paper, we concisely describe how to simulate a mediumband wireless communication scenario from a single transmitter (TX) to a single receiver (RX) in MATLAB, elaborating the operation of key PHY subsystems. The approach described here ensures that the simulated system captures the delicate dynamics of mediumband wireless communication, including the effect of deep fading avoidance.</description>

      <title>Redefining Information Theory: From Quantization and Rate--Distortion to a Foundational Mathematical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper redefines information theory as a foundational mathematical discipline, extending beyond its traditional role in engineering applications. Building on Shannon's entropy, rate'--distortion theory, and Wyner'--Ziv coding, we show that all optimization methods can be interpreted as projections of continuous information onto discrete binary spaces. Numbers are not intrinsic carriers of meaning but codes of information, with binary digits (0 and 1) serving as universal symbols sufficient for all mathematical structures. Rate'--distortion optimization via Lagrangian multipliers connects quantization error directly to fundamental limits of representation, while Wyner'--Ziv coding admits a path integral interpretation over probability manifolds, unifying quantization, inference, geometry, and error. We further extend this framework into category theory, topological data analysis, and universal coding, situating computation and game theory as complementary perspectives. The result is a set of postulates that elevate information theory to the status of a universal mathematical language.</description>

      <title>Iterative Gaussian Approximation for Random Spreading Unsourced Random Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) demand robust solutions to support extensive connectivity efficiently. Unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a promising approach, delivering high spectral and energy efficiency. Among URA code structures, the random spreading (RS) category is a key enabler, providing strong anti-interference capabilities through spectrum spreading gain. Notably, RS-URA approaches theoretical performance limits over the Gaussian multiple access channel in scenarios with few active users. In this paper, we propose an iterative Gaussian approximation decoder designed universally for RS-URA categories. The proposed receiver iterates extrinsic and intrinsic soft information to enhance decoding performance, requiring only a few iterations to converge. Numerical results validate the decoder's effectiveness in terms of performance and robustness.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

Abstract: Given $N$ geodesic caps on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and whose total normalized surface area sums to one, what is the maximal surface area their union can cover? In this work, we provide an asymptotically sharp upper bound for an antipodal partial covering of the sphere by $N \in (\omega(1),e^{o(\sqrt{d})})$ congruent caps, showing that the maximum proportion covered approaches $1 - e^{-1}$ as $d\to\infty$. We discuss the relation of this result to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions, the limitations of our technique via the Gaussian surface area bounds of K. Ball and F. Nazarov, and its applications in computer science theory.</description>

      <title>Aerial Active STAR-RIS-assisted Satellite-Terrestrial Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An integration of satellites and terrestrial networks is crucial for enhancing performance of next generation communication systems. However, the networks are hindered by the long-distance path loss and security risks in dense urban environments. In this work, we propose a satellite-terrestrial covert communication system assisted by the aerial active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (AASTAR-RIS) to improve the channel capacity while ensuring the transmission covertness. Specifically, we first derive the minimal detection error probability (DEP) under the worst condition that the Warden has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then, we formulate an AASTAR-RIS-assisted satellite-terrestrial covert communication optimization problem (ASCCOP) to maximize the sum of the fair channel capacity for all ground users while meeting the strict covert constraint, by jointly optimizing the trajectory and active beamforming of the AASTAR-RIS. Due to the challenges posed by the complex and high-dimensional state-action spaces as well as the need for efficient exploration in dynamic environments, we propose a generative deterministic policy gradient (GDPG) algorithm, which is a generative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve the ASCCOP. Concretely, the generative diffusion model (GDM) is utilized as the policy representation of the algorithm to enhance the exploration process by generating diverse and high-quality samples through a series of denoising steps. Moreover, we incorporate an action gradient mechanism to accomplish the policy improvement of the algorithm, which refines the better state-action pairs through the gradient ascent. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms important benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Emerging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only, thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio. Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher data rates and better privacy preservation.</description>
