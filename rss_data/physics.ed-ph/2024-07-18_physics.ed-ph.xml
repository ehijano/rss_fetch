      <title>Teaching Quantum Informatics at School: Computer Science Principles and Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of knowledge from quantum physics to computer science, which we call \doubleq{quantum informatics}, is driving the development of new technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum key distribution. Researchers in physics education have recognized the promise and significance of teaching quantum informatics in schools, and various teaching methods are being developed, researched and applied. Although quantum informatics is equally relevant to computer science education, little research has been done on how to teach it with a focus on computer science concepts and knowledge. In this study, we position quantum informatics within Denning's Great Principles of Computing and propose Quantum Informatics Standards for secondary schools.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation projects in micromagnetics with Jupyter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a case study where an existing materials science course was modified to include numerical simulation projects on the micromagnetic behavior of materials. The Ubermag micromagnetic simulation software package is used in order to solve problems computationally. The simulation software is controlled through Python code in Jupyter notebooks. Our experience is that the self-paced problem-solving nature of the project work can facilitate a better in-depth exploration of the course contents. We discuss which aspects of the Ubermag and the project Jupyter ecosystem have been beneficial for the students' learning experience and which could be transferred to similar teaching activities in other subject areas.</description>
