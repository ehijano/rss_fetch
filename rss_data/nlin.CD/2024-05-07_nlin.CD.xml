      <title>Spiral Attractors in a Reduced Mean-Field Model of Neuron-Glial Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that bursting activity plays an important role in the processes of transmission of neural signals. In terms of population dynamics, macroscopic bursting can be described using a mean-field approach. Mean field theory provides a useful tool for analysis of collective behavior of a large populations of interacting units, allowing to reduce the description of corresponding dynamics to just a few equations. Recently a new phenomenological model was proposed that describes bursting population activity of a big group of excitatory neurons, taking into account short-term synaptic plasticity and the astrocytic modulation of the synaptic dynamics [1]. The purpose of the present study is to investigate various bifurcation scenarios of the appearance of bursting activity in the phenomenological model. We show that the birth of bursting population pattern can be connected both with the cascade of period doubling bifurcations and further development of chaos according to the Shilnikov scenario, which leads to the appearance of a homoclinic attractor containing a homoclinic loop of a saddle-focus equilibrium with the two-dimensional unstable invariant manifold. We also show that the homoclinic spiral attractors observed in the system under study generate several types of bursting activity with different properties.</description>

      <title>Bipartite OTOC in open quantum systems: information scrambling and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of information scrambling has seen significant growth over the last decade, where the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a prominent tool to probe it. In this work, we use bipartite OTOC, a particular form of OTOC, to study information scrambling in the atom-field interaction models and the model of the Ising spin chain interacting with a tilted magnetic field. This is done considering the effects of open quantum systems. A relationship between information scrambling, using bipartite OTOC, and irreversibility, using entropy production, is probed under unitary dynamics. The equivalence of bipartite OTOC with operator entanglement is explicitly shown for the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Neurocomputational Phenotypes in Female and Male Autistic Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by an altered phenotype in social interaction and communication. Additionally, autism typically manifests differently in females as opposed to males: a phenomenon that has likely led to long-term problems in diagnostics of autism in females. These sex-based differences in communicative behavior may originate from differences in neurocomputational properties of brain organization. The present study looked to examine the relationship between one neurocomputational measure of brain organization, the local power-law exponent, in autistic vs. neurotypical, as well as male vs. female participants. To investigate the autistic phenotype in neural organization based on biological sex, we collected continuous resting-state EEG data for 19 autistic young adults (10 F), and 23 controls (14 F), using a 64-channel Net Station EEG acquisition system. The data was analyzed to quantify the 1/f power spectrum. Correlations between power-law exponent and behavioral measures were calculated in a between-group (female vs. male; autistic vs. neurotypical) design. On average, the power-law exponent was significantly greater in the male ASD group than in the female ASD group in fronto-central regions. The differences were more pronounced over the left hemisphere, suggesting neural organization differences in regions responsible for language complexity. These differences provide a potential explanation for behavioral variances in female vs. male autistic young adults.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and Parameterization Inference with Uncertainty Quantification through Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations with uncertainty quantification. Our framework incorporates online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, facilitated by differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Optical chaos synchronisation in a cascaded injection experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the synchronization of chaos generated by semiconductor lasers in a cascade injection configuration, i.e., a tunable master laser is used to generate chaos by optical injection in a transmitter laser that injects light into a receiver laser. Chaos synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver lasers is achieved with a correlation coefficient of 90 % for a measurement bandwidth up to 35 GHz. Two parameter regions of good synchronization are found, corresponding to the alignment of the oscillation frequencies of the receiver laser with either the transmitter laser or the master laser.</description>
