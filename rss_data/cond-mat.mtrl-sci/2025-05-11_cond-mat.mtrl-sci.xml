      <title>Cerium doped graphene-based materials towards oxygen reduction reaction catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the global transition towards cleaner energy and sustainable processes, the demand for efficient catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction reaction, has gained attention from the scientific community. This research work investigates cerium-doped graphene-based materials as catalysts for this process with density functional theory calculations. The electrochemical performance of Ce-doped graphene was assessed within the computation hydrogen electrode framework. Our findings reveal that Ce doping, especially when synergized with an oxygen atom, shows improved catalytic activity and selectivity. For instance, Ce doping in combination with an oxygen atom, located near a border, can be selective for the 2-electron pathway. Overall, the combination of Ce doping with structural defects and oxygenated functions lowers the reaction free energies for the oxygen reduction compared to pure graphene, and consequently, might improve the catalytic activity. This research sheds light from a computational perspective on Ce-doped carbon materials as a sustainable alternative to traditional costly metal-based catalysts, offering promising prospects for green energy technologies and electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Development of precession Lorentz transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) is a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of magnetic textures, including their dynamics under external stimuli and ultrafast nonequilibrium conditions. However, magnetic imaging is often hindered by non-magnetic diffraction contrast arising from inhomogeneous sample deformation or a non-parallel electron beam. In this study, we develop a precession LTEM system that can suppress diffraction contrast by changing the incident angle of the electron beam relative to the sample in a precessional manner. By comparing LTEM images acquired at different precession angles ($\theta$), we show that diffraction contrast is significantly reduced with increasing $\theta$. However, large $\theta$ values lead to an undesired broadening of the magnetic contrast, highlighting the importance of optimizing $\theta$. Furthermore, defocus-dependent measurements reveal that magnetic contrast is particularly improved at small defocus values, suggesting that precession LTEM can achieve higher spatial resolution. These findings demonstrate the potential of precession LTEM as a powerful technique for studying magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Singlet Exciton Back-Transfer using 2D Spacer Layers for Perovskite-Sensitised Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon upconversion has potential applications in light-emitting diodes, photocatalysis, bio-imaging, microscopy, 3D printing, and photovoltaics. Bulk lead-halide perovskite films have emerged as promising sensitisers for solid-state photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. In this system, a perovskite sensitiser absorbs photons and subsequently generates triplet excitons in an adjacent emitter material, where triplet-triplet annihilation can occur allowing for the emission of higher energy photons. However, a major loss pathway in perovskite-sensitised upconversion is the back-transfer of singlet excitons from the emitter to the sensitiser via F\"orster Resonance Energy Transfer. In this investigation we introduce a 2D perovskite spacer layer between the bulk perovskite sensitiser and a rubrene emitter to mitigate back-transfer of singlet excitons from rubrene to the bulk perovskite sensitiser. This modification reveals the inherent balance between efficient triplet exciton transfer across the interface with a potential barrier versus the mitigation of near-field back-transfer by increasing the distance between the sensitiser and singlet excitons in the emitter. Notably, the introduction of this spacer layer enhances the relative upconversion efficiency at lower excitation power densities while also sustaining performance over extended timescales. This work represents significant progress toward the practical applications of perovskite-sensitised photon upconversion.</description>

      <title>Core-Ionized States and X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Solids From Periodic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first-ever implementation and benchmark of periodic algebraic diagrammatic construction theory (ADC) for core-ionized states and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in crystalline materials. Using a triple-zeta Gaussian basis set and accounting for finite-size and scalar relativistic effects, the strict and extended second-order ADC approximations (ADC(2) and ADC(2)-X) predict the core ionization energies of weakly correlated solids within ~ 1.5 and 0.5 eV of experimental measurements, respectively. We further demonstrate that the ADC(2)-X method can capture the satellite features in XPS spectra of graphite, cubic and hexagonal boron nitride, and TiO2, albeit significantly overestimating their energies. The ADC(2)-X calculations reveal that the satellite transitions display strong configuration interaction with excitations involving several frontier orbitals delocalized in phase space. Our work demonstrates that ADC is a promising first-principles approach for simulating the core-excited states and X-ray spectra of materials, highlighting its potential and motivating further development.</description>

      <title>Atypical Ferrimagnetism in the case of Ni$_4$Nb$_2$O$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetism typically emerges from chemically distinct magnetic ions or mixed-valence states. In contrast, we discover an unconventional route to ferrimagnetism in Ni4Nb2O9, where identical Ni(2+) ions at crystallographically equivalent positions develop unequal magnetic moments purely due to differences in their local environments. Through a synergy of powder neutron diffraction, inelastic neutron scattering, first-principle-based calculations, we reveal that the Ni(A) and Ni(B) sublattices, despite sharing the same nominal valence, differ in octahedral distortion, magnetic dimensionality, and electronic structure. Ni(A) exhibits a quasi one-dimensional character, enhanced p-d hybridization, and reduced magnetic moment due to spin delocalization onto oxygen, while Ni(B) retains a nearly two-dimensional geometry and a full spin-1 moment. Our findings demonstrate that structural and electronic inequivalence alone can induce ferrimagnetism, offering a new design principle for materials with controllable magnetic compensation and anisotropy relevant for spintronic applications and beyond.</description>

      <title>Ab initio X-ray Near-Edge Spectroscopy of Sodium-Based Multi-Alkali Antimonides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-alkali antimonides (MAAs) are promising materials for vacuum electron sources. While sodium-based MAAs have demonstrated superior characteristics for ultrabright electron sources, their synthesis remains challenging, often resulting in mixed stoichiometries and polycrystalline domains. To address this complexity and guide the characterization of experimentally grown photocathodes, we present a comprehensive theoretical study of the X-ray near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of four ternary MAAs: cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, representing the experimentally known phase of each stoichiometry, as well as hexagonal Na$_2$KSb and cubic NaK$_2$Sb, two computationally predicted polymorphs. Employing state-of-the-art ab initio methods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium and potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and L$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the experimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb, particularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing useful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further investigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their counterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting their significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower core levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the experimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Bipolar doping in van der Waals semiconductor through Flexo-doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping plays a key role in functionalizing semiconductor devices, yet traditional chemical approaches relying on foreign-atom incorporation suffer from doping-asymmetry, pronounced lattice disorder and constrained spatial resolution. Here, we demonstrate a physical doping technique to directly write nanoscale doping patterns into layered semiconductors (MoS2). By applying localized tensile and compressive stress via an atomic force microscopy probe, p and n type conductance are simultaneously written into the designed area with sub-100-nm resolution, as verified by spatially resolved capacitance and photocurrent experiments. Density functional theory calculations reveal strain-driven shifts of donor and acceptor levels, as large as several hundreds of meV, linking mechanical stress to semiconductor doping. Fabricated strain-engineered junction efficiently rectifies the current flow and performs logic operations with stable dynamic response. This strain-driven approach enables spatially precise doping in van der Waals materials without degrading crystallinity, offering a versatile platform for nanoscale semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of the structural and elastic properties of 2H-MX$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (M = W, Mo, Ta, Nb; X = S, Se). Using density functional theory with various van der Waals exchange-correlation functionals, we systematically investigate the influence of nonlocal interactions on lattice parameters, elastic constants, and mechanical moduli. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between semiconducting and metallic TMDs: metallic compounds exhibit larger in-plane lattice parameters and reduced interlayer spacing, consistent with their bonding characteristics. We find that metallic TMDs display significantly lower in-plane stiffness and shear modulus compared to their semiconducting counterparts. We discuss this behaviour in the context of the observed charge density waves. In addition, we establish clear trends in the bulk, Young's, and shear moduli, demonstrating the role of atomic number and chemical composition in determining mechanical stability.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy related to hybridization between Fe 3$d$ and As 4$p$ orbitals in a bcc Fe-As thin film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy (MA) of Fe-based ferromagnetic thin films has been extensively studied for device applications. The examined material is a new Fe-based ferromagnetic thin film, bcc Fe$_{1-x}$As$_x$ (Fe-As) with the in-plane MA (IMA) grown on a GaAs (111)B substrate. The magnetic properties of the Fe-As thin film have been investigated by Xray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and magnetic circular dichroism in hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (MCD-HAXPES) to elucidate the role of As ions in the IMA. The XMCD spectra at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge and MCD-HAXPES spectra of the Fe 2$p$ core level exhibit ferromagnetic and metallic features like Fe metal. The XMCD at the As $L_{2,3}$ edge demonstrates that the As ions contribute to the ferromagnetism of bcc Fe-As through the hybridization between the Fe 3$d$ and As 4$p$ orbitals. The estimations of the magnetic moments of Fe using the XMCD sum rules have revealed that the orbital magnetic moment is isotropic and the magnetic dipole term is anisotropic. The anisotropy of the magnetic dipole term can be attributed to the anisotropic $p-d$ hybridization due to epitaxial strain, contributing to the IMA of bcc Fe-As. Our findings enlighten the mechanism of the MA of the non-magnetic ion-doped bcc Fe thin film, which can be applied to other magnetic 3$d$ transition metal thin films doped with non-magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>Luminescent Platform for Thermal Sensing and Imaging Based on Structural Phase-Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable sensitivity of the luminescent properties of Eu3+ ions to structural changes in host materials has been well-explored for years. However, the application of this feature of Eu3+ in materials exhibiting thermally induced structural phase transitions for the development of luminescent thermometers has only recently been proposed. The narrow operating range of such thermometers necessitates the exploration of new host materials. In response to this demand, this study carefully analyzes the spectroscopic properties of X as a function of temperature and dopant ion concentration. As demonstrated, X undergoes a phase transition from a low-temperature monoclinic phase to a high-temperature trigonal structure, resulting in significant changes in both the emission spectrum shape of Eu ions and the depopulation kinetics of the 5D0 level. Consequently, X can be utilized as both a ratiometric and a lifetime-based luminescence thermometer, achieving maximal relative sensitivities of 3.4 and 1.0 or the respective approaches. Additionally, this work highlights how increasing the concentration of Eu3+ ions enables the tuning of the thermal operating range to achieve optimal thermometric performance. Moreover, an implementation of ratiometric approach of temperature sensing and imaging with X using digital camera without filters was demonstrated. This is the first report that demonstrates thermal imaging using Eu3+-solely doped phosphor. This finding underscores the potential of X as a versatile host material for advanced luminescent thermometry applications.</description>

      <title>Periodic implementation of the random phase approximation with numerical atomic orbitals and dual reciprocal space grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) has emerged as a prominent first-principles method in material science, particularly to study the adsorption and chemisorption of small molecules on surfaces. However, its widespread application is hampered by its relatively high computational cost. Here, we present a well-parallelised implementation of the RPA with localised atomic orbitals and pair-atomic density fitting, which is especially suitable for studying two-dimensional systems. Through a dual $\textbf{k}$-grid scheme, we achieve fast and reliable convergence of RPA correlation energies to the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our implementation through an application to the adsorption of CO on MgO(001) using PBE input orbitals (RPA@PBE) Our calculated adsorption energy in in good agreement with previously published RPA@PBE studies, but, as expected, overestimates the experimentally available adsorption energies as well as recent CCSD(T) results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polymer shell offers a unique opportunity to tailor structural and optical properties of optically functional nanoparticles and their ensembles. Here, we develop a process to coat Mie-resonant silicon nanospheres (Si NSs) with a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel shell. We show formation of a PNIPAM shell of controlled thickness from the change of the hydrodynamic diameter and study the effect of thermoresponsive shrinkage and expansion of the shell on the Mie resonance of a Si NS. We then demonstrate that Si NSs with PNIPAM shells enable fabrication of cluster-free, self-assembled monolayers of Si NSs, in which distances between NSs are controlled by the PNIPAM shell thickness.</description>

      <title>Neutron scattering studies of complex lattice dynamics in energy materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice dynamics play a crucial role in understanding the physical mechanisms of cutting-edge energy materials. Many excellent energy materials have complex multiple-sublattice structures, with intricate lattice dynamics, and the underlying mechanisms are difficult to understand. Neutron scattering technologies, which are known for their high energy and momentum resolution, are powerful tools for simultaneously characterizing material structure and complex lattice dynamics. In recent years, neutron scattering techniques have made significant contributions to the study of energy materials, shedding light on their physical mechanisms. This review article details several neutron scattering techniques commonly used in energy material research, including neutron diffraction, total neutron scattering, quasi-elastic and inelastic neutron scattering. Then, some important research progress made in the field of energy materials in recent years using neutron scattering as the main characterization method is reviewed, including ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity in superionic thermoelectric materials, ion diffusion mechanism of solid-state electrolytes, plastic-crystalline phase transition and configuration entropy changes in barocaloric materials, lattice anharmonicity and charge transport in photovoltaic materials, and first-order magnetic-structural phase transition in magnetocaloric materials. In these complex energy conversion and storage materials, lattice dynamics do not work independently, and their functioning in macroscopic physical properties is always achieved through correlation or mutual coupling with other degrees of freedom, such as sublattices, charge, spin, etc. Through these typical examples, this review paper can provide a reference for further exploring and understanding the energy materials and lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Photovoltaic Hall Effect by Electric Field-Induced Berry Curvature and Energy Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicity-dependent photocurrents perpendicular to a bias electric field have attracted considerable attention as an expression of optically controlled Berry curvature in Floquet engineering. More recent studies have revealed a larger contribution by the momentum asymmetry of photocarriers to this photovoltaic Hall effect, although its physical mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we describe this phenomenon as a circular photogalvanic effect caused by an electric field-induced Berry curvature. The shift vector provides an additional contribution through the energy shift of interband transitions. A resonant enhancement of the transverse photocurrent occurs in GaAs owing to the topological character of the valence band. Our results present a geometric picture of the third-order nonlinear response under light and bias fields, shedding new light on Berry curvature engineering.</description>

      <title>A Piezoelectric Molecular Cocrystal with Unconventional $\pi$-Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the crystallization of a polar octafluoronaphthalene (OFN, \OFN)--phthalazine (Phth, \Phth) cocrystal, formed in a 1:2 ratio by slow evaporation. The crystal structure and vibrational properties of the cocrystal were determined using powder/single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and confirmed with density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations. The molecular $\pi$-stacking of aromatic rings is unconventional compared with other arene--perfluoroarene cocrystals. Phth molecules are offset and misaligned with respect to the major axis of OFN due to electrostatic repulsion between N and F atoms, enabling overall electric polarization attributed to the dipole moment of Phth. Our calculations show that OFN:2Phth is an insulator with a band gap of $\sim$2.4 eV. The electric polarization was calculated to be 7.1 \muC, while the shear piezoelectric coefficient ($d_{34}$) may be as large as 11.4 pC N$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Above-room-temperature ferromagnetism in large-area epitaxial Fe3GaTe2/graphene van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a two-dimensional (2D) layered ferromagnetic metal, exhibits a high Curie temperature (TC) ~ 360 K along with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making it a promising material candidate for next-generation energy-efficient magnetic devices. However, the vast majority of studies on FGaT to date have been limited to millimeter-sized bulk crystals and exfoliated flakes, which are unsuitable for practical applications and integration into device processing. Also, its combination with other 2D materials to form van der Waals heterostructures has only been achieved by flake stacking. Consequently, the controlled large-scale growth of FGaT and related heterostructures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate a breakthrough in the high-quality, large-scale growth of epitaxial FGaT thin films on single-crystalline graphene/SiC templates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization confirms the high crystalline quality of the continuous FGaT/graphene van der Waals heterostructures. Temperature-dependent magnetization and anomalous Hall measurements reveal robust PMA with an enhanced TC well above room temperature, reaching up to 400 K. Furthermore, X-ray absorption and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra provide insight into the spin and orbital magnetic moment contributions, further validating the high TC and robust PMA. These findings are highly significant for the future development of high-performance spintronic devices based on 2D heterostructures, with potential applications in next-generation data storage, logic processing and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal ice density dependence on inter atomic distance changes due to nuclear quantum effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal ice ($\rm{I_h}$), the most common structure of ice, displays a variety of fascinating properties. Despite major efforts, a theoretical description of all its properties is still lacking. In particular, correctly accounting for its density and interatomic interactions is of utmost importance as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of other properties. Deep potentials are a recent alternative to investigate the properties of {\iceIH}, which aims to match the accuracy of \textit{ab initio} simulations with the simplicity and scalability of classical molecular dynamics. This becomes particularly significant if one wishes to address nuclear quantum effects. In this work, we use machine learning potentials obtained for different exchange and correlation functionals to simulate the structural and vibrational properties of {\iceIH}. We show that most functionals overestimate the density of ice compared to experimental results. Furthermore, a quantum treatment of the nuclei leads to even further distancing from experiments. We understand this by highlighting how different inter-atomic interactions play a role in obtaining the equilibrium density. In particular, different from water clusters and bulk water, nuclear quantum effects lead to stronger H-bonds in {\iceIH}.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature, enabling their analysis at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La- APT). In this study, we show that UV and deep-UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>New Advances in Phonons: From Band Topology to Quasiparticle Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonons, the quantized vibrational modes of a crystal lattice, are ubiquitous quasiparticles in solid-state systems. They play a central role in a wide range of physical phenomena, from thermal transport, as primary carriers of heat in insulators, to their involvement in symmetry-breaking orders such as charge density waves and superconductivity. Traditionally considered as spinless bosons, phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring topological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band theory initially formulated for fermionic systems. It is now understood that the phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, can carry nontrivial topological invariants such as Berry curvature and Chern numbers, despite the absence of spin or charge. This new understanding opens up avenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and chirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of topological and chiral phonons. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts, including the classification of phononic band structures, symmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological invariants in bosonic systems. Special attention is given to the concept of phonon angular momentum and its fundametal connection to Weyl phonons in inversion-symmetry-breaking systems. We then discuss key experimental realizations of topological and chiral phonons across a variety of material platforms. Finally, we outline outstanding challenges and promising directions for future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated quasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>ProME: An Integrated Computational Platform for Material Properties at Extremes and Its Application in Multicomponent Alloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE (Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$ (Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software) for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates, and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in materials research and development.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin dynamics after dual optical excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort optical pulses are a cornerstone for manipulating electronic and magnetic states in materials on a femtosecond timescale. Conventional models assume that optical excitation primarily modifies the occupation of the electron energy levels without long-lasting altering of the coupling of individual electrons in certain processes. Here, we demonstrate that optical excitation with two femtosecond pulses that come from different directions fundamentally transforms the electron dynamics in copper, affecting the efficiency of angular momentum transfer between electrons and the lattice. Using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements, we reveal a ~2.5. increase in spin imbalance decay time following inverse Faraday effect excitation under dual-pump conditions compared to single-pulse excitation. This observation challenges the prevailing paradigm of ultrafast light-matter interactions, showing that dual optical excitation can transiently modify electron dynamics beyond simple changes in the energy levels occupancy. Our findings open new avenues for controlling quantum states through a dual pump approach, with implications for ultrafast spintronics and the design of novel light-driven states.</description>

      <title>A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is available) also re-evaluated.</description>

      <title>Design of a molecular Field Effect Transistor (mFET)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are ubiquitous in electronics. As we scale FETs to ever smaller sizes, it becomes natural to ask how small a practical FET might be. We propose and analyze an atomically precise molecular FET (herein referred to as an "mFET") with 7,694 atoms made only of hydrogen and carbon atoms. It uses metallic (4,4) carbon nanotubes as the conductive leads, a linear segment of Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) as the channel, Lonsdaleite as the insulating layer between the channel and the gate, and a (20,20) metallic carbon nanotube as the surrounding gate. The (4,4) nanotube leads are bonded to the channel using a mix of 5- and 6-membered rings, and to the gate using 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. Issues of component design assessment and optimization using quantum chemical methods are discussed throughout. A 10 watt sugar-cube-sized computer made with $10^{18}$ such mFETs could deliver $\sim 10^{25}$ switching operations per second.</description>

      <title>One-third magnetization plateau in a spin-1 kagome magnet BaNi$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and magnetic properties of BaNi$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$, focusing on its spin-1 kagome lattice and the intricate coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Powder x-ray diffraction analysis confirms a highly crystalline trigonal structure. Detailed Rietveld refinement identifies a single crystallographic Ni site, indicative of a perfect kagome lattice. Magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest predominantly ferromagnetic interactions with an effective magnetic moment consistent with Ni$^{2+}$ spins, yet the system undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering at a N$\'e$el temperature of 5.8 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a series of metamagnetic transitions culminating in a plateau-like phase near one-third of the total saturation magnetization. Analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the antiferromagnetic phase supports a substantial net moment in each kagome layer, comparable to that of the one-third plateau. This observation challenges the conventional model-where a 120$^\circ$ ground state transitions to an up-up-down configuration-commonly assumed for kagome antiferromagnets. Instead, our findings indicate that both the zero-field ground state and the field-induced phases exhibit in-plane ferrimagnetic spin arrangements on the kagome lattice, with the metamagnetic transition corresponding to a shift from layer-by-layer antiferromagnetically aligned net moments to ferromagnetically aligned ones. This configuration is stabilized by bond frustration, a network of competing interactions that can favor both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, highlighting the essential role of frustration in governing the low-temperature magnetic behavior of spin-1 kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Directed light emission from monolayers on 2D materials via optical interferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials provide a rich platform to explore phenomena such as emerging electronic and excitonic states, strong light-matter coupling and new optoelectronic device concepts. The optical response of monolayers is entangled with the substrate on which they are grown or deposited on, often a two-dimensional material itself. Understanding how the properties of the two-dimensional monolayers can be tuned via the substrate is therefore essential. Here we employ angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence spectroscopy on highly ordered molecular monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to systematically investigate the angle-dependent optical response as a function of the thickness of the hBN flake. We observe that light reflection and emission occur in a strongly directed fashion and that the direction of light reflection and emission is dictated by the hBN flake thickness. Transfer matrix simulations reproduce the experimental data and show that optical interference effects in hBN are at the origin of the angle-dependent optical properties. While our study focuses on molecular monolayers on hBN, our findings are general and relevant for any 2D material placed on top of a substrate. Our findings demonstrate the need to carefully choose substrate parameters for a given experimental geometry but also highlight opportunities in applications such as lighting technology where the direction of light emission can be controlled via substrate thickness.</description>

      <title>Engineering inter-band coupling in a two-band superconductor by topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Representation of tensor functions using low-order structural tensor set: two-dimensional point group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is essential to constitutive modeling of materials including both mechanical and physical behaviors. Generally, material symmetry is incorporated in the tensor functions through a structural or anisotropic tensor that characterizes the corresponding point group. The general mathematical framework was well-established in the 1990s. Nevertheless, the traditional theory suffers from a grand challenge that many point groups involve fourth or sixth order structural tensors that hinder its practical applications in engineering. Recently, researchers have reformulated the representation theory and opened up opportunities to model anisotropic materials using low-order (i.e., 2nd-order and lower) structural tensors only, although the theory was not fully established. This work aims to fully establish the reformulated representation theory of tensor functions for all two-dimensional point groups. It was found that each point group needs a structural tensor set to characterize the symmetry. For each two-dimensional point group, the structural tensor set is proposed and the general tensor functions are derived. Only low-order structural tensors are introduced so researchers can readily apply these tensor functions for their modeling applications. The theory presented here is useful for constitutive modeling of materials in general, especially for composites, nanomaterials, soft tissues, etc.</description>

      <title>High-chirality and multiquaternion Weyl nodes in hexagonal ReO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of two-band nodal points in gapless topological phases, referred to as conventional Weyl nodes, relies solely on translational symmetry. However, when coupled with other spatial and spatio-temporal symmetries, unconventional Weyl nodes with high degeneracy, pronounced chirality, and complementary quaternion charges can manifest. In this work, we identify ReO3 as an ideal unconventional Weyl semimetal in which rotation and screw symmetries as well as their combination with time-reversal symmetry play a crucial role. To show this, we first revisit in detail the algebraic determination of the chirality of Weyl nodes from the spinful irreducible representations of the occupied and unoccupied bands, and then combine it with the complementary C2T-symmetry-protected patch Euler class and non-Abelian frame charges that indicates the pinning of the Weyl nodes on C2T-invariant planes. Supporting our findings with first-principles calculations, we furthermore reveal very clear Fermi arc signatures of the high-chirality Weyl nodes at the Fermi level for different surface orientations. We finally investigate the effect of strain upon which the robustness of Weyl nodes clearly demonstrates their Chern (i.e. chirality conservation) and quaternionic (i.e. symmetry-plane pinning) topological nature.</description>

      <title>Human Perception-Inspired Grain Segmentation Refinement Using Conditional Random Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated detection of grain boundaries in electron microscope images of polycrystalline materials could help accelerate the nanoscale characterization of myriad engineering materials and novel materials under scientific research. Accurate segmentation of interconnected line networks, such as grain boundaries in polycrystalline material microstructures, poses a significant challenge due to the fragmented masks produced by conventional computer vision algorithms, including convolutional neural networks. These algorithms struggle with thin masks, often necessitating post-processing for effective contour closure and continuity. Previous approaches in this domain have typically relied on custom post-processing techniques that are problem-specific and heavily dependent on the quality of the mask obtained from a computer vision algorithm. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a fast, high-fidelity post-processing technique that is universally applicable to segmentation masks of interconnected line networks. Leveraging domain knowledge about grain boundary connectivity, this method employs conditional random fields and perceptual grouping rules to refine segmentation masks of any image with a discernible grain structure. This approach significantly enhances segmentation mask accuracy, achieving a 79% segment identification accuracy in validation with a U-Net model on electron microscopy images of a polycrystalline oxide. Additionally, a novel grain alignment metric is introduced, showing a 51% improvement in grain alignment. This method not only enables rapid and accurate segmentation but also facilitates an unprecedented level of data analysis, significantly improving the statistical representation of grain boundary networks, making it suitable for a range of disciplines where precise segmentation of interconnected line networks is essential.</description>

      <title>Oxide Membranes from Bulk Micro-Machining of SrTiO$_3$ substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suspended micro-structures based on complex oxides relies on surface micro-machining processes such as those based on sacrificial layers. These processes prevent to physically access the microstructures from both sides, as substantial part of the substrate is not removed. In this work, we develop a bulk micromachining protocol of a commonly used substrate employed in oxide thin film deposition. We realize suspended oxide thin film devices by fabricating pass-through holes across SrTiO$_3$(100) or SrTiO$_3$(110) substrates. Careful calibration of anisotropic etching rates allows controlling the final geometry of the aperture in the substrate in a predictable way. As demonstrators of possible device geometries, we present clamped membranes and trampolines of (La,Sr)MnO$_3$, a conductive magnetic oxide, and a suspended trampoline resonator carved from the SrTiO$_3$ substrate itself. Reported protocols can be readily extended to a broad variety of other complex oxides so to extend the application of membranes technology beyond those of commercially-available silicon compounds.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization based on element mapping to design high-capacity NASICON-type cathode in sodium-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To discover novel materials with high performance, there have been many attempts to adopt Bayesian optimization (BO) to materials science, owing to its efficiency in navigating complex and high-dimensional design spaces. However, the application of BO to material design has been suffered from handling discrete input variables, such as elements. Here, we introduce a novel element mapping strategy that encodes elemental identities into chemically meaningful continuous values, enabling to create easy-to-predict chemical spaces. We apply this new framework to design high capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries, targeting that shift all working voltages into the desired operational voltage window. The proposed framework successfully suggests 16 optimal element composition within 50 iterations. Our results demonstrate the way to overcome the limitation of categorical input that will likely broaden the applicability of BO to a wider range of material discoveries.</description>

      <title>Energy shifts and broadening of excitonic resonances in electrostatically-doped semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides crucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping levels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire heterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancy Defects with Machine-Learned Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A striking example is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic energy lowering and change in behaviour. These species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for the efficient identification of these defects, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all solid-state compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of low energy split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of (foundation) machine-learning potentials, with important caveats, the significant prevalence of split vacancy defects in inorganic solids, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for defect modelling.</description>

      <title>Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex is caused by the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the electron--hole scattering with a phonon mode. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron--phonon interaction. Model Hamiltonians and {\em ab--initio} approaches have instilled the idea that this retardation is, in most of the cases, negligible. In this work I demonstrate that the dynamical screening of the electron--phonon vertex cannot be neglected {\em a priori}. By using a perturbative expansion I introduce a controllable and physically sound method to evaluate and include dynamical screening effects. Based on the exact results of the homogeneous electron gas I propose a dynamical vertex correction function $\Gamma_{e-p}(\omega)$ designed to screen the commonly used adiabatic electron--phonon interaction. This function is expressed in terms of adiabatic quantities, that can be easily calculated and used to evaluate the strength of the dynamical corrections, even in realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian and Liouvillian skin effects in magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.</description>

      <title>MachMachine Learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery in CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. We propose new promising candidates such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</description>
