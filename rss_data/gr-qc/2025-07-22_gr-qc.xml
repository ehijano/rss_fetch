      <title>A new parametric observational study of $f(Q,B)$ gravity with modified chaplygin gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity framework based on the function $f(Q,B)=\delta Q^{2}+\beta B$, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ is the boundary term that relates $Q$ to the Ricci scalar. The matter sector is modeled using the Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) with the equation of state $p=A\rho-\frac{B}{\rho^{\alpha}}$, allowing the model to interpolate between early-time matter behavior and late-time cosmic acceleration. By deriving an analytical expression for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, we perform a parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in conjunction with the latest cosmological observations: $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, $15$ BAO data points, DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation. The best-fit values are obtained as $H_0 = 72.22^{+3.64}_{-4.46}$, $A_s = 0.696^{+0.082}_{-0.129}$, $\alpha = 0.0029^{+0.022}_{-0.021}$, and $A = 0.0038^{+0.071}_{-0.047}$. The deceleration parameter transitions at redshift $z_{tr} \approx 0.946$, while the present-day value is $q_0 = -0.789$. The model yields an age of the Universe $t_0 \approx 13.53$ Gyr and a present EoS parameter $\omega_0 \approx -0.691$, which reflects the late-time acceleration consistent with observational bounds. These results demonstrate that the MCG scenario within $f(Q,B)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally consistent framework for explaining the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe.</description>

      <title>The Sound of an Orbit: A Quantum Spectrum at the ISCO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Accretion Disk Luminosity and Topological Characteristics for a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study some characteristics and gravitational signatures of the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a Hernquist dark matter halo (SBH-HDM). We determine the black hole's remnant radius and mass, which provide useful residual information at the end of its evaporation. We then explore the luminosity of the accretion disk from the SBH-HDM model. In this way, we determine the key orbital parameters of the test particles within the accretion disk, such as angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, based on the dark matter model parameters. We also numerically estimate the accretion disk's efficiency in converting matter into radiation. We also demonstrate that dark matter, which significantly alters the geometry surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole, influences the accretion disk's radiative flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity. The stability of a black hole spacetime is determined in the eikonal regime. The Lyapunov exponent is also analyzed to quantify the stability of the particle regime and to demonstrate the infall into or escape from the black hole to infinity, as well as the quasi-normal modes. Finally, some properties of black holes are studied from a topological perspective.</description>

      <title>Perturbative emergent modified gravity on cosmological backgrounds: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent modified gravity has shown that the canonical formulation of general relativity gives rise to a larger class of covariant modifications than action-based approaches, so far in symmetry-reduced models. This outcome is made possible by distinguishing between the space-time metric on a given solution, and the basic field degrees of freedom in which equations of motion are formulated. In this general treatment, the metric is no longer fundamental but emerges after field equations and covariance conditions are solved. Here, the results are extended to perturbative inhomogeneity on a spatially flat cosmological background, showing that new modifications are possible while maintaining the classical derivative order and setting the stage for dynamical equations suitable for detailed studies of early-universe models.</description>

      <title>Topological classification of black holes surrounded by quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of black hole solutions surrounded by quintessence as defects possessing topological characteristics within the thermodynamic space. By formulating a generalized off-shell free energy and calculating the winding number for each black hole branch through the residues of isolated first-order poles of characteristic function defined by this free energy, the winding number reflects the local properties of black holes. The topological number, being the sum of winding numbers for all black hole branches, reflects global properties. Utilizing the residue method, we discovered that the topological numbers for Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr-AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence are consistent with those not surrounded by quintessence. Furthermore, 4D/5D Einstein-Gauss Bonnet black holes under a quintessence field belong to the same topological class as Kerr black holes. Thus both the rotation parameter and Gauss-Bonnet parameter in this background field affect the topological number of the black hole. Importantly, the winding numbers for generation and annihilation points can be calculated using the residues of second-order poles of the characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Conformal Cauchy Slice Holography: An Alternative Phase Space For Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase space of gravitational theories in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AAdS) spacetimes consists of geometries, matter configurations, and their conjugate momenta on a Cauchy surface, subject to the Hamiltonian, momentum, and matter-gauge constraints. When a unique maximal volume slice exists in all classical solutions of the bulk equations of motion, and the matter fields satisfy certain conditions, we show that this phase space is physically equivalent to an alternative phase space in which the Hamiltonian constraint is replaced by the real Weyl-anomaly constraint, while the momentum and matter-gauge constraints remain unchanged. A necessary requirement for a functional of the metric and matter configurations to qualify as a valid quantum gravity state is that it satisfies the operator gauge constraints. Partition functions of certain conformal field theories with imaginary central charge, defined on bulk Cauchy slices, satisfy these operator gauge constraints and therefore provide candidate quantum gravity states in the alternative phase space formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope's 2024 observations report a shift in the position angle of the brightness asymmetry in M87*, revealing time variability in the black hole's image. In this analysis, we investigate the time-dependent of a Vaidya black hole. By introducing a mass function that increases linearly with time, along with a conformal transformation, we derive the conformal Vaidya metric and define a new time coordinate $t_c$. Using the semi-analytical approach, we analyze the ray trajectories and radiation flux of the Vaidya black hole in the background of a thin accretion disk. We discuss how the observed flux in the Vaidya spacetime evolves as a function of the new time coordinate $t_c$. The results show that the facula on the observable plane undergoes radial displacement as $t_c$ increases, revealing the time-dependent evolution of black hole images.</description>

      <title>Properties of compact objects in quadratic non-metricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations, which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that, in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Influence of the external electromagnetic field on the properties of the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk in Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model is widely employed in astrophysics, yet computing its blackbody spectrum theoretically requires analytical expressions for the orbital parameters -- specific energy, angular momentum, and angular velocity -- of the constituent timelike particles, a task extremely challenging in non-integrable curved spacetimes. In this work, we numerically obtain these orbital parameters for quasi-Keplerian motion in Kerr spacetime with an asymptotically uniform magnetic field using iterative, finite-difference, and interpolation methods, enabling simulations of the disk's energy flux density, temperature, and blackbody spectra across diverse spin parameters, observational inclinations, and magnetic field strengths. We demonstrate that when the magnetic field aligns with the black hole's angular momentum, the disk's radiation positively correlates with field strength, while spectral analysis for our specific black hole mass and accretion rate reveals a conservative detectable threshold of $1.0638 \times 10^{-9}$ T for ambient magnetic fields. This study not only extends the Novikov-Thorne model to non-integrable axisymmetric spacetimes but also establishes the first direct relationship between external magnetic fields and disk properties, providing critical theoretical support for future magnetic environment studies through disk radiation observations.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional gravity, black holes and mirror (topological) stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss static, spherically symmetric solutions to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell equations (belonging to wide classes of multidimensional solutions known at least from the 1990s) and select among them those which must observationally look like local objects whose surface reflects back particles or signals getting there, the so-called mirror stars (also called ``topological stars'' by some authors). Their significant parameters are the Schwarzschild mass $m$ and the magnetic charge $q$, such that $q^2 &gt; 3m^2$. For comparison, we also discuss their black hole counterparts for which $q^2 &lt; 3m^2$. For both these objects, we study spherically symmetric time-dependent perturbations and determine the stability regions in their parameter spaces. Our stability results disagree with some of those previously announced in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Lattice Physics Approach to Spin-Networks in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we model a spin-network in loop quantum gravity as a regular tetrahedral lattice, applying lattice physics techniques to study its structure and vertex dynamics. Using the area eigenvalue, $A\propto 8\pi l_P^2$, we derive a lattice constant $a = 2.707\,l_P$ and construct a vertex Hamiltonian incorporating a Lennard-Jones potential, zero-point energy, and simple harmonic oscillations. A foliation approach enforces the Wheeler-DeWitt constraint via locally non-zero Hamiltonians that globally cancel. Graviton-like perturbations (treated here as spin-0 bosons) modify the vertex energy spectrum, with variational analysis suggesting twelve coherent excitations per vertex. This model frames flat spacetime as a graviton-rich lattice while enforcing a Brownian-like stochastic picture for the gravitons, and offers a basis for extension into curved quantum geometries.</description>

      <title>Universality of gravitational radiation from magnetar magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts `universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse how different Generalised Uncertainty Principles could place bounds on the compactness of self-gravitating systems. By considering existing experimental bounds on the relevant parameters, we conclude that the compactness of large astrophysical objects is bounded above by the inverse of the GUP parameter, which would naturally be of order one. Conversely, the existence of black holes imposes stronger bounds on those parameters.</description>

      <title>Evolving Wormholes in a Cosmological Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wormholes are non-trivial topological structures that arise as exact solutions to Einstein's field equations, theoretically connecting distinct regions of spacetime via a throat-like geometry. While static traversable wormholes necessarily require exotic matter that violates the classical energy conditions, subsequent studies have sought to minimize such violations by introducing time-dependent geometries embedded within cosmological backgrounds. This review provides a comprehensive survey of evolving wormhole solutions, emphasizing their formulation within both general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. We explore key developments in the construction of non-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static solutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar fields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter backgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole dynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories, especially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of traversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not violate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide range of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific geometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently with the null and weak energy conditions. These findings clarify how such configurations can be naturally integrated into cosmological models governed by general relativity or modified gravity, thereby contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding of localized spacetime structures in an expanding universe.</description>

      <title>A note on entropy of matter in presence of gravity: status of extensivity of entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy of matter in a very strong gravity depends on cross-sectional area of the container of the system -- is being further bolstered by calculating entropy of a monoatomic gas kept under uniform strong gravity at Newtonian scale. This bypasses the earlier analysis where existence of horizon is crucial. Also the extensivity of this entropy has been discussed in the light of the same of a two-space dimensional ultra-relativistic non-interacting gas without gravity. The whole analysis, as far as entropy is concerned, indicates that under strong gravity the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system are effectively contributed by the cross-sectional area of the system.</description>

      <title>Optics in spiral dislocation spacetime: Torsion as a geometric waveguide and frequency-filtering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of null trajectories and scalar wave propagation in a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime containing a spiral dislocation-a topological defect characterized by torsion in the absence of curvature. For null rays, the torsion parameter $\beta$ modifies the affine structure, enforcing a finite turning radius $r_{\min} = \sqrt{b^2 - \beta^2}$ and inducing a torsion-mediated angular deflection that decreases monotonically with increasing $\beta$. The photon trajectory deviates from the curvature-induced lensing paradigm, exhibiting a purely topological exclusion zone around the defect core. In the wave regime, we recast the Helmholtz equation into a Schr\"odinger-like form and extract a spatially and spectrally dependent refractive index $n^2(r,k)$. This index asymptotically approaches unity at large distances, but diverges strongly and negatively near the dislocation core due to torsion-induced geometric terms. The resulting refractive index profile governs the transition from propagating to evanescent wave behavior, with low-frequency modes experiencing pronounced localization and suppression. Our findings reveal that torsion alone, absent any curvature, can act as a geometric regulator of both classical and quantum propagation, inducing effective anisotropy, frequency filtering, and confinement. This framework provides a rare exact realization of light-matter interaction in a torsion-dominated background, with potential applications in analog gravity systems and photonic metamaterials engineered to replicate non-Riemannian geometries.</description>

      <title>Constraint on gravitational-wave polarizations for space-based detectors with time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing extra polarizations in gravitational waves (GWs) with space-based detectors is the most direct method for testing theories of gravity. In this paper, by employing the second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to cancel out the laser frequency noise in a rotating and flexing configuration with arm lengths varying linearly in time, we study the detectors' constraint ability on extra polarizations, and explore the impacts of TDI on the constraint of polarizations. Working in the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE) waveform framework, we find that the constraints on extra polarizations are significantly weaker than those for the tensor mode. For the tensor mode, the constraint ability for the detectors scales with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At low frequency, due to signal cancellation effects, the SNR registered is lower for the detectors with TDI method than that with the simplified equal-arm Michelson interferometer method. Therefore, tensor-mode constraints are degraded when TDI is applied. Although the direct detection of extra polarizations remains challenging, the constraint ability of the space-based detectors on the vector mode is better than the scalar modes. Besides, the detectability on extra polarizations will be enhanced with TDI, and the improvement of the constraint on the vector mode is less than scalar modes due to the inclination-dependent waveforms.</description>

      <title>General form for Pseudo-Newtonian Potentials, imitating Schwarzschild geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new, general form for a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential (PNP), expressed as a series of Paczy\'nski-Wiita-like functions with the addition of increasing negative powers of $r$ with arbitrary coefficients. We present a procedure for determining these coefficients to construct a custom PNP that replicates key features of Schwarzschild geodesics for a test particle near a black hole. As an example, we construct potentials set to reproduce (I) the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit at the $r=6$ (geometric units), with the correct infall velocity for small deviations (on the geodesic universal infall), (II) the periapsis advance at large distances, and (III) the presence of a marginally bound circular orbit with specific angular momentum $L=4$, and the periapsis advance of parabolic orbits close to it. We compare the performance of our examples against the Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential and other existing potentials. Finally, we discuss the limitations and advantages of our formulation.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Dark energy era with a resolution of Hubble tension in generalized entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new dark energy (DE) model from four parameter generalized entropy function of apparent horizon in a spatially flat universe. Such kind of generalized entropy is able to generalize all the known entropies proposed so far, for suitable representations of the entropic parameters. It turns out that the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of present Hubble parameter for certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to a possible resolution of Hubble tension issue. We confront the scenario with CC, PantheonPlus+SH0ES, DESI DR1 and compressed Planck likelihood datasets, which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent with the resolution of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Equatorial light bending around a Hairy Kiselev Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection angle of light rays confined to the equatorial plane of a Hairy Kiselev black hole. The analysis includes a thorough study of the horizon structure and critical parameters, leading to an analytic expression for the deflection angle in terms of elliptic integrals. Our results confirm that the deflection angle decreases with increasing impact parameter, in agreement with classical predictions of gravitational lensing. The influence of the scalar field, characterized by the coupling constant, shows a nontrivial effect: while moderate values of the coupling constant initially enhance light bending, further increases lead to a suppression of the deflection in the strong-field regime due to modifications in spacetime geometry. Comparative analysis among the Schwarzschild, Kiselev, and Hairy Kiselev black holes indicates that the presence of a quintessential field tends to enhance the deflection, whereas the scalar hair component reduces it. These findings underscore the significant role of scalar fields and exotic matter distributions in shaping light propagation in a modified gravity scenario.</description>

      <title>A New High-Performing Method for Solving the Homogeneous Teukolsky Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical waveforms for the extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) require a huge amount of homogeneous solutions of the Teukolsky equation in the frequency domain. The calculation accuracy and efficiency of the homogeneous solutions are the key performance bottleneck in waveform generation. In this paper, we propose a new numerical method based on the analytical series expansion which is most efficient for computing the homogeneous solutions with very high accuracy and a wider frequency range compared with the existing methods. Our new method is definitely useful for constructing the waveform templates of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Regge poles of analogous rotating black holes in binary Bose-Einstein condensates: The gapped excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone (fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large) scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern in experiments.</description>

      <title>Leveraging NRTidalv3 to develop gravitational waveform models with higher-order modes for binary neutron star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable gravitational waveform models are crucial in determining the properties of compact binary mergers. In particular, next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will require more accurate waveforms to avoid biases in the analysis. In this work, we extend the recent NRTidalv3 model to account for higher-mode corrections in the tidal phase contributions for binary neutron star systems. The higher-mode, multipolar NRTidalv3 model is then attached to several binary-black-hole baselines, such as the phenomenological IMRPhenomXHM and IMRPhenomXPHM models, and the effective-one-body-based model SEOBNRv5HM_ROM. We test the performance and validity of the newly developed models by comparing them with numerical-relativity simulations and other tidal models. Finally, we employ them in parameter estimation analyses on simulated signals from both comparable-mass and high-mass-ratio systems, as well as on the gravitational-wave event GW170817, for which we find consistent results with respect to previous analyses.</description>

      <title>Lunar and Terrestrial Time Transformation Based on the Principle of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lunar time metrology necessitates a unified temporal framework beyond Earth, requiring an independent lunar system for timekeeping, dissemination, and calendrics. Recent American publications define Lunar Coordinate Time (LTC) within relativity and propose a Terrestrial Time (TT) to LTC conversion formula. However, this formula's derivation and assumptions are contested. The complex dynamics within the solar system can be simplified by decomposing relationships into hierarchical wide-area (external problem) and local-area (internal problem) levels. Grounded in the symmetry and conservation laws of physics, Einstein's general relativity emphasizes two key principles: (i) Equal weighting: Relationships among multi-level coordinate systems are independent and self-similar (analogous to fractals). (ii) *Locality*: The laws of physics retain invariant forms only in local coordinate systems. Specifically, a non-rotating system corresponds to the Frenet frame along a particle's geodesic. Preserving physical law invariance requires restricting rotating references strictly to the local domain; defining the orientation of an Earth-centered system using distant celestial bodies violates general relativity's locality principle. This work derives the relationship between coordinate time and proper time. Using the Earth-Moon system as an intermediary, it obtains a simplified transformation formula between LTC and TT. An independent and universal lunar standard time framework is proposed. Crucially, the derived coordinate time transformation coefficient exhibits long-term secular variation. This variation can be measured and predicted through precise Earth-Moon time comparisons.</description>

      <title>Can Static Black Holes in Massive Gravity Serve as Candidates for Aschenbach-Like Phenomena?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential, corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic velocity profiles.
  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect in rotating spacetimes?</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from inspiraling compact binaries in quadratic gravity and their parameterized post-Einstein characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational waveforms from the inspiral phase of compact binary systems within the framework of quadratic gravity and map their deviations from general relativity into the parameterized post-Einstein (PPE) formalism to constrain the theory parameters. Quadratic gravity generically includes a massive spin-2 ghost, which leads to ill-defined energy and angular momentum fluxes. Following earlier proposals, we remove these unphysical features by imposing a constraint on the massive spin-2 mode, restricting it to propagate only the same polarizations of general relativity. Within the quadrupole approximation, we derive the radiative degrees of freedom, including massless and massive tensor modes, as well as a massive scalar field. Using the stationary phase approximation, we compute the Fourier-domain waveform of the massless tensor modes and extract the phase corrections. For small deviations from general relativity, we show that both the scalar and massive tensor modes can be consistently embedded into the PPE framework, extending previous results that considered only scalar fields. We derive updated constraints on the parameters of quadratic gravity, finding bounds improved by three orders of magnitude compared to existing limits. Finally, we present forecasts for the sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope to these deviations.</description>

      <title>Towards relativistic inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals, compact objects spiraling into massive black holes, represent key sources for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical environments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a fully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of matter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a modified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then implement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment through a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a result, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of Teukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of the matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the Teukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles. Additionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral, contributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into the global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments. Furthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future computation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of bulk viscous cosmological model in $F(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk viscous cosmological models is presented in the teleparallel ($F(T)$, where $T$ denotes torsion) gravity. In the teleparallel gravity, the Lagrangian of the gravitational action contains a general function $F(T)= T+ f(T)=(1+ \gamma) T+\alpha (-T)^n$, where $\gamma$, $n$ and $\alpha$ are dimensional constants. Cosmological solutions in Eckart theory and Truncated Israel Stewart theory are talked about in $F(T)=(1+ \gamma) T+\alpha (-T)^n$ gravity form which is one of the most generalized gravity form in the torsional gravity. The substantial and geometrical prospective of the cosmological models in Eckart theory and Truncated Israel Stewart theory in $F(T)$ gravity are deliberated for flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space time. Dynamical analysis of the fixed points of exponential expansion in $F(T)$ with bulk viscous cosmological models are studied here. The characteristics of the various cosmological parameters such as bulk viscous pressure, energy density, scale factor, Hubble parameter and entropy evolution are studied in Power law and Exponential models. Stability analysis of the exponential models are also argued with cosmic growth in the relevant theories by using directional plots. The cosmological models are supported by observations results.</description>

      <title>Learning Null Geodesics for Gravitational Lensing Rendering in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time. Our findings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for rendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to astronomical visualization.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity black holes as dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major problems in quantum gravity research is the lack of signals at the reach of present or near-future experimental facilities. In this paper, we show that this is not the case. Contrary to previous claims, the quantum decay of de Sitter space into black hole spacetimes can be significant even after inflation and can be observed on galactic scales. Using the instanton formalism within the no-boundary proposal for a class of short-scale, quantum-gravity-improved black holes, we show that de Sitter space decay would result in the production of $10^{60}$ stable Planck-size black hole remnants within the current Hubble horizon, which is the number required to explain dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Inflationary Quartic Hilltop Model in a Modified Gravity and Its Comparison with the Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inflation for the quartic hilltop model via a certain type of modified gravity. Precisely, we analyze the $F(\phi) T$ term in the Einstein's gravity to examine the quartic hilltop inflation model. $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and $\phi$ is the inflaton field. Next, we calculate the inflation dynamics for the foregoing model and obtain the slow-roll parameters, i.e., the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the tensor-to-scale ratio ``$r$'', which these parameters exhibit high sensitivity to the $F(\phi) T$ term. This modified form of the gravity is not only in accordance with the predictions of the original model but also allows for better prediction of the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems: An Introduction to Fundamental Structures, Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06450v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This textbook introduces the basic concepts of the theory of causal fermion systems, a recent approach to the description of fundamental physics. The theory yields quantum mechanics, general relativity and quantum field theory as limiting cases and is therefore a candidate for a unified physical theory. From the mathematical perspective, causal fermion systems provide a general framework for describing and analyzing non-smooth geometries and "quantum geometries." The dynamics is described by a novel variational principle, the causal action principle.
  The book includes a detailed summary of the mathematical and physical preliminaries. It explains the physical concepts behind the causal fermion system approach from the basics. Moreover, all the mathematical objects and structures are introduced step by step. The mathematical methods used for the analysis of causal fermion systems and the causal action principle are introduced in depth. Many examples and applications are worked out.
  The textbook is addressed to master and graduate students in mathematics or physics. Furthermore, it serves as a reference work for researchers working in the field.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Safety and Canonical Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of gravity the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms have been developed largely independently, emphasizing renormalization and quantization, respectively. The formalisms use a different methodology to distinguish between gauge and physical degrees of freedom. In this review we analyze the connection between the Asymptotically Safe and Canonical Quantum Gravity approaches. Based on the Hamiltonian formulation, the Canonical Quantum Gravity approach inherently provides a natural framework for defining observables. This serves as the foundation for constructing the generating functional of the $n$-point correlation functions of physical degrees of freedom. By means of background-independent, non-perturbative renormalization methods well-established in the Lagrangian framework and typically employed in Asymptotic Safety, the resulting generating functional can be handled. In particular, we employ the Functional Renormalization Group to regularize the path integral and to compute the flow connecting the bare theory in the ultraviolet with the effective infrared theory. An important advantage of this approach is that it establishes an explicit, systematic relation between the quantization procedure and the systematics of quantum field theory-based renormalization group methods. More importantly, this synthesis not only bridges canonical and covariant approaches but also paves the way for a consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity grounded in physically meaningful, gauge-invariant observables.</description>

      <title>Multiply quantized vortex spectroscopy in a quantum fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However, here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We observe common features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the study of universal amplification phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic (EM) helicity flux density and the magnetic helicity are related by topological Chern-Simons terms. We show that the helicity flux density is distinguished from magnetic helicity by analysing Hopf solitons. We find the helicity flux density for a point charge moving with an acceleration, extending the Li\'enard-Wiechert angular distribution of radiant power. We also derive the multipole expansion of the helicity flux density, generalizing the Larmor's formula for the radiant power. These formulae have been applied to discuss the helicity flux density in several toy models such as circular and helical motion as well as soft bremsstrahlung. We also comment on the potential applications of the EM helicity flux density to pulsar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate our program to classify conformal fluid boundary conditions, by utilizing the fluid/gravity correspondence in the AdS/BCFT correspondence. The AdS/BCFT correspondence is a conjectured duality between a quantum gravity in asymptotically AdS spacetime with an end-of-the world brane and a boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). We show that a choice of boundary condition for the metric on the end-of-the world brane naturally leads to specific boundary conditions for velocity field and temperature field of BCFT in the hydrodynamic limit. We analyze the Neumann, Dirichlet and Conformal boundary conditions for the metric on the end-of-the world brane, and discuss their implications for conformal fluid boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes ($3$ $M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 150$ $M_\odot$) are the natural product of the evolution of heavy stars ($M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 20$ $M_\odot$). In our Galaxy, we expect $10^8$-$10^9$ stellar-mass black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of heavy stars, but currently we know less than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$ stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by gravitational wave observatories in the past 10 years. The detection of black holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases. This article is a short review on the physics and astrophysics of stellar-mass black holes.</description>

Abstract: We establish the global existence and precise estimates of a class of singularity-free cosmological solutions in nonlinear Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (ESGB) gravity with quadratic coupling, in close agreement with previous numerical results. Our analysis also yields a rigorous mathematical proof of nonlinear spontaneous scalarization, triggered by a tachyonic instability induced by the Gauss-Bonnet term. The proof is based on a set of decoupled differential inequalities for the Hubble parameter $H$, derived from a key structural identity that we refer to as the power identity.</description>

      <title>Eternal inflation near inflection points: a challenge to primordial black hole models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation with an inflection point potential is a popular model for producing primordial black holes. The potential near the inflection point is approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,' the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker--Planck equation over a bounded region. We write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons. These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Universe without dark energy: matter creation after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally, applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured, however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event, with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$, $M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate $R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. We also show that the resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}= 1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$, is at the border of the exclusion regions, but still remains self-consistent. Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict with current pulsar timing arrays data.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background signal in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \&amp; Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.</description>

      <title>\texttt{GWBird}: a toolkit for the characterization of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background for Ground, Space, and Pulsar Timing Array detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) is one of the most challenging tasks for both current and next-generation detectors. Successfully distinguishing the SGWB from instrumental noise and environmental effects requires accurate and flexible analysis tools capable of detecting the signal and determining its origin. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework and a user-friendly tool for SGWB characterization: \texttt{GWBird} (Gravitational Wave Background Inventory of Response functions for Detectors). This code enables the computation of overlap reduction functions (ORFs), power-law integrated sensitivity curves (PLS), angular response functions, and angular PLS (APLS). It supports the full range of gravitational wave polarization modes (tensor, scalar, and vector), allowing for the characterization of both isotropic and anisotropic SGWB components for all the polarizations. Additionally, the code includes functions for circular polarization characterization, which is particularly relevant for probing parity-violating signals. The framework integrates analyses for ground-based, space-based, and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) detectors, offering a versatile framework for SGWB analysis. The \texttt{GWBird} code is publicly available at:~\github{https://github.com/ilariacaporali/GWBird}</description>

Abstract: Recent works have argued that improved one-loop beta-functions capturing the physical momentum dependence of one-loop corrected higher-derivative gravity theories are the most suitable to describe their high-energy behaviour. This work critically tests the validity of this claim. We compute the explicit gauge dependence of the one-loop momentum running of curvature-squared operators in quadratic gravity and conformal gravity using the background field method. We find them to be gauge dependent, and we discuss the implications of this result for the theory and its physical predictivity.</description>

Abstract: Modified General Relativity (MGR) is the natural extension of General Relativity (GR). MGR explicitly uses the smooth regular line element vector field $(\bm{X},-\bm{X}) $, which exists in all Lorentzian spacetimes, to construct a connection-independent symmetric tensor that represents the energy-momentum of the gravitational field. It solves the problem of the non-localization of gravitational energy-momentum in GR, preserves the ontology of the Einstein equation, and maintains the equivalence principle. The line element field provides MGR with the extra freedom required to describe dark energy and dark matter. An extended Schwarzschild solution for the matter-free Einstein equation of MGR is developed, from which the Tully-Fisher relation is derived, and the gravitational energy density is calculated. The mass of the invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation. The three classic tests of GR provide a comparison of the theories in the solar system and several parts of the cosmos. MGR provides the flexibility to describe inflation after the Big Bang and galactic anisotropies.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of cosmological dynamics of tachyon fluid coupled to varyingmass dark matter particles in the background of spatially flat FLRW universe. The mechanism of varying mass particles scenario assumes the mass of the dark matter depends on time t through the scalar field ${\phi}$ in the sense that the decaying of dark matter reproduces the scalar field. First, we analyze the model from dynamical systems perspective by converting the cosmological evolution equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations with a suitable transformation of variables. We choose the mass of dark matter as exponential function of scalar field and the exponential potential of the tachyon field is undertaken in such a way that the autonomous system is reduced in three dimensional form. The critical points obtained from the system are non-hyperbolic in nature. The center manifold theory is employed to discuss the nature of the critical points. Numerical investigation also carried out for some critical points. From this analysis, we obtain dust dominated decelerated transient phase of the universe followed by dark energy dominated scaling attractor alleviating the coincidence problem. Next, we perform the statefinder diagnostic approach to compare our model to ${\Lambda}$CDM and finally we study the evolution of the Hubble parameter and the distance modulus and compare this with observational data.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of the charged test particle in a Kerr-MOG black hole with explicit symplectic algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr-MOG black hole has recently attracted significant research attention and has been extensively applied in various fields. To accurately characterize the long-term dynamical evolution of charged particles around Kerr-MOG black hole, it is essential to utilize numerical algorithms that are high-precision, stable, and capable of preserving the inherent physical structural properties. In this study, we employ explicit symplectic algorithms combined with the Hamiltonian splitting technique to numerically solve the equations of motion for charged particles. Initially, by decomposing the Hamiltonian into five integrable components, three distinct explicit symplectic algorithms ($S2$, $S4$, and $PR{K_6}4$) are constructed. Numerical experiments reveal that the $PR{K_6}4$ algorithm achieves superior accuracy. Subsequently, we utilize Poincar\'e sections and the Fast Lyapunov Indicator (FLI) to investigate the dynamic evolution of the particle. Our numerical results demonstrate that the energy $E$, angular momentum $L$, magnetic field parameter $\beta$, black hole spin parameter $a$, and MOG parameter $\alpha$ all significantly influence the particle's motion. Specifically, the chaotic region expands with increases in $E$, $\beta$, or $\alpha$, but contracts with increases in $a$ or $L$. Furthermore, when any two of these five parameters are varied simultaneously, it becomes evident that $a$ and $L$ predominantly dictate the system's behavior. This study not only offers novel insights into the chaotic dynamics associated with Kerr-MOG black holes but also extends the application of symplectic algorithms in strong gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Spin effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals up to the third post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binary sources that emit gravitational waves (GW) are expected to be both spinning and on eccentric orbits. No closed-form expression for the phasing of GWs are available to date that contain information from both spin and eccentricity. The introduction of eccentricity can slow waveform generation, often requiring slower numerical methods governing its evolution. However, closed-form expressions for the waveform phase can be obtained when eccentricity is treated as a small parameter, enabling quick waveform generation. In this paper, closed-form expressions for the GW phasing in the form of Taylor approximants up to the eighth power in initial eccentricity $(e_0)$ are obtained while also including aligned spins up to the third post-Newtonian order. The phasing is obtained in both time and frequency domains. The fully analytical approximant (TaylorT2) is also resummed for usage in scenarios where initial eccentricities are as high as 0.5. The frequency domain approximant (TaylorF2) based on Stationary Phase approximation is compared with an existing model (TaylorF2Ecc) to assess the importance of the newly computed eccentric/spinning terms. The findings indicate that for eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.15$ (defined at 10 Hz) and small spins $(\sim 0.2)$, the mismatches can be higher than 1%. This leads to an overall loss in signal-to-noise ratio and lower detection efficiency of GWs coming from eccentric spinning compact binary inspirals if the combined effects of eccentricity and aligned spins are neglected in the waveforms.</description>

Abstract: We prove a convergence theorem for the $(3+1)$-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations with positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M} \cong M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed, connected, oriented three-manifold of negative Yamabe type. In constant mean curvature transported spatial coordinates, we show that solutions arising from arbitrarily large initial data converge to a Riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature in infinite Newtonian-like' time'. As a consequence, the Einstein-$\Lambda$ flow generically fails to produce geometrization in the sense of Thurston and violates the cosmological principle. Our results affirm a conjecture of Ringstr\"om concerning the asymptotic indistinguishability of spatial topology in the large data regime. A related result is established for positive Yamabe type under a technical condition.</description>

      <title>Effect of kick velocity on gravitational wave detection of binary black holes with space- and ground-based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the coalescence of binary black holes (BBHs), asymmetric gravitational wave (GW) emission imparts a kick velocity to the remnant black hole, affecting observed waveforms and parameter estimation. In this study, we investigate the impact of this effect on GW observations using space- and ground-based detectors. By applying Lorentz transformations, we analyze waveform modifications due to kick velocities. For space-based detectors, nearly 50% of detected signals require corrections, while for ground-based detectors, this fraction is below one-third. For Q3d population model, space-based detectors could observe kick effects in over 60% of massive BBH mergers, while in pop3 model, this fraction could drop to 3$\sim$4%. Third-generation ground-based detectors may detect kick effects in up to 16% of stellar-mass BBH mergers. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating kick velocity effects into waveform modeling, enhancing GW signal interpretation and our understanding of BBH dynamics and astrophysical implications.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the critical parameters that delineate the existence of black holes, identifying the permissible ranges that facilitate their formation. A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of black holes is conducted, leading to the calculation of black hole remnants. We investigate the trajectory of light, establishing an upper limit for the parameters based on Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*, ensuring that the black hole's shadow resides within the allowed region. Furthermore, we derive the quasinormal modes (QNMs) for both scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. Utilizing a topological framework, we examine the stability of the photon sphere and classify the topology of the black hole in accordance with its thermodynamic potentials.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Chromatic Microlensing Search: No Evidence in the Gravitational Wave Catalog of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs) due to intervening matter distribution in the universe can lead to chromatic and achromatic signatures in the wave-optics and geometrical-optics limit respectively. This makes it difficult to model for the unknown mass distribution of the lens and hence requires a model-independent lensing detection technique from GW data. We perform the first model-independent microlensing search in the wave-optics limit on the 72 super-threshold GW events observed with both the LIGO detectors up to the third observation catalog GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA using the analysis method $\mu$-\texttt{GLANCE}. These unmodelled searches pick up one plausible candidate $\rm GW190408\_181802$ with a slightly above threshold residual amplitude compared to the residual expected from detector noise. However, exploring the microlensing modulation signatures on this event, we do not find any conclusive evidence of the microlensing signal in the data. With this, we confidently rule out the presence of any statistically significant microlensing signal in the 72 events up to GWTC-3 in a model-independent way.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of $k-$future convex spacelike/null hypersurface $\Sigma$ in an $n+1$ dimensional spacetime $M$ and prove that no $k-$dimensional closed trapped submanifold (k-CTM) can be tangent to $\Sigma$ from its future side. As a consequence, k-CTMs cannot be found in open spacetime regions foliated by such hypersurfaces. In gravitational collapse scenarios, specific hypersurfaces of this kind act as past barriers for trapped submanifolds. A number of examples are worked out in detail, two of them showing 3+1 spacetime regions containing trapped loops ($k=1$) but no closed trapped surfaces ($k=2$). The use of trapped loops as an early indicator of black hole formation is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: This work applies the principles of quantum cosmology to examine models incorporating a quintom field. Specifically, three distinct models are analyzed: a simplified toy model, a model featuring an exponential quintom potential, and one where the quintom field is coupled with a negative cosmological constant. For each case, we study the classical trajectories within the configuration space, present solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology, and discuss physical interpretations and consequences. A key focus is the behavior of wave packets in the minisuperspace framework. Notably, the correspondence principle (connection between classical and quantum solutions) is also demonstrated. Furthermore, the appropriate quintom duality is introduced, and we discuss its consequences. A section including interesting and challenging discussions is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical duality exists between massless scalar fields and relativistic fluids governed by an ultrastiff equation of state, in which the pressure equals the mass-energy density, and the sound speed equals $c$. This duality entails that certain solutions of the wave equation (a linear theory) can be mapped to solutions of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics (an inherently nonlinear theory). Leveraging this correspondence, we explore some interesting properties of ultrastiff fluids. Specifically, we demonstrate that all nonlinear sound waves in such media are solitons. Moreover, we prove that, in 3+1 dimensions, compactly supported configurations of an ultrastiff fluid inevitably evolve, in finite time, toward a singular state where the fluid's flow velocity exits the future lightcone. We also demonstrate that, prior to the formation of this singularity, first-order perturbation theory in the small parameter $c_s^{-2}-c^{-2}$ produces divergent results. As a consequence, a fluid whose speed of sound is, say, $0.995 c$ exhibits markedly different behavior near the singularity compared to a fluid with a speed of sound exactly equal to $c$.</description>

      <title>The frozen vanilla model: Exploring dark sector interactions with delta effective theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new interacting mechanism within the dark sector, encompassing both dark energy and dark matter, while grounding our analysis in the familiar framework of the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ model augmented by baryons and radiation components, including photons and neutrinos. The interaction between dark energy and dark matter is confined to the perturbative level. One significant advantage of this proposal is that all geometric probes yield constraints consistent with the so-called vanilla model or the extended vanilla model, where dark energy has a constant equation of state, $w_{x}$. However, the introduction of this new interacting mechanism affects several theoretical signatures, involving contrast dark matter and dark energy densities. We perform an exploratory analysis of those effects in the CMB power spectra, matter-power spectra, and redshift space distortions. For instance, it allows for a decrease/increment in the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect depending on the value taken by the interaction coupling. This effect could be observationally detected by looking for a cross-correlation between the ISW temperature fluctuations and the distribution of galaxies or quasars. At late times, the interaction in the dark sector becomes very effective, affecting the non-linear scale of structure formation. We discuss how the estimators $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ and $S_{8}(z)$ are affected by different interacting couplings; indicating that $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ can show a relative change of up to $15\%$ compared to the concordance model at low redshifts. Finally, we show how the various terms in the dark energy pressure perturbation (both adiabatic and non-adiabatic) are relevant for different scales, demonstrating the absence of large-scale instabilities.</description>

      <title>Test particle motion around a black hole dressed with a spherically symmetric stationary fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of a massive particle around a spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by a stationary and radial inflow of perfect fluid. The background spacetime is modelled as a spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein field equations, where the effect of the fluid on the geometry is treated as a perturbation on the Schwarzschild background. The equation of state for the fluid is assumed to follow the linear relationship $p = w \rho$, where $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the energy density with $w$ being a constant. The stress-energy tensor is treated as a phenomenological model to capture deviations from the vacuum Einstein theory. We allow the parameter $w$ of the equation of state to take both positive and negative values accepting a broad range of scenarios including exotic ones. Specifically, we examine the cases $w =2/3$, $1/3$, $-3/4$ and $-4/3$. For $\rho\geq0$, the former two cases satisfy all standard energy conditions while the case of $w=-3/4$ violates the strong energy condition and the case of $w=-4/3$ violates all standard energy conditions. By solving the geodesic equations, we visualize the time-like geodesics around the black hole, focusing on the apsis shift of the orbit. To gain further insight into the effects of accretion, we employ the method of osculating orbital elements. Additionally, we analyze the observable effects on spacetime by studying the redshift of the orbiting test particles as an example of possible observables. We show that the difference in the particle orbits due to the matter accretion may be probed by using the redshift observation of stars orbiting around the black hole.</description>

Abstract: The thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity is an analogy with a dissipative fluid. The scalar degree of freedom excites gravity to a positive ``temperature'', while Einstein gravity is the ``zero-temperature'' equilibrium state. We extend this thermal analogy to the interior region near the singularity of spherical, vacuum, uncharged black holes by using the universality of the Kasner behaviour near spacelike singularities. The singularity is ``hot'', meaning that gravity diverges from general relativity. The discussion is then extended to black holes in the presence of perfect or imperfect fluids with constant equation of state -- the latter determines whether Einstein gravity is approached or not.</description>

      <title>Stealth black hole solutions in higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions in higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories. We do not particularly focus on the degenerate classes of theories. For several specific choices of the coupling functions, we show that in the presence of the ordinary Maxwell kinetic term the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(anti-)de Sitter solution in the pure Maxwell-Einstein theory can also be a solution in generic classes of higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories, and in the absence of the ordinary Maxwell kinetic term the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter solution with the nonzero electric field can be obtained. This corresponds to a stealth black hole solution as the electric field does not affect the spacetime geometry. We then focus on several degenerate classes of higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories, and find that the dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(anti-)de Sitter solution in the pure Maxwell-Einstein theory can be a solution.</description>

      <title>$g$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrollian field theories are usually understood as limits of relativistic theories. In this note, we use Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a principal connection to construct Carrollian sigma models intrinsically. The resulting theories are neither ``electric'' nor ``magnetic'' in the usual sense. As a physically suggestive example, we derive a Carrollian wave equation governing the dynamics of a scalar field on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Alekseev-Garcia and the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>York Cavity Formalism and Canonical Ensemble Thermodynamics of (2+1)D Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I perform a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic behavior of (2+1) dimensional Banados Teitelboim Zanelli (BTZ) black holes contained within the canonical ensemble framework, utilizing York formalism. A static, non-rotating BTZ black hole is considered inside a finite radius circular cavity maintained at constant temperature. By getting the measure of the Euclidean action, I obtain expressions for thermodynamic parameters including temperature, entropy, energy, pressure, and heat capacity. I confirm the validity of the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law and examine the thermal stability of the system through heat capacity analysis. Furthermore, I identify conditions for a transition of phase to a stable black hole state from hot flat space and explore the density of states from a statistical mechanics perspective. Moreover, I examine JT coefficient and heat engine efficiency for the BH. Together, our results demonstrate the consistency of York approach and highlight it as a robust tool to investigate black hole thermodynamics in lower-dimensional gravity.
  Keywords: York's cavity formalism, Canonical ensemble, BTZ black hole, Black hole thermodynamics, JT coefficient, Black hole heat engine efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Infeasibility of Low-Energy Warp Drive via Metamaterial Gravitational Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent ``low-energy'' warp-drive concepts propose replacing the constant gravitational coupling $\kappa_0$ with a spatially varying scalar field $\kappa(x)$ set by an engineered metamaterial's electromagnetic response. We show that the idea fails on both theoretical and experimental grounds. A prescribed, non-dynamical $\kappa(x)$ in the field equation $G^{\mu\nu} = \kappa(x)T^{\mu\nu}$ clashes with the contracted Bianchi identity, $\nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu} \equiv 0$, forcing $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} \neq 0$ and thus violating local energy-momentum conservation. Making $\kappa(x)$ dynamical yields a scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar mediates a new long-range force that breaks the strong equivalence principle; Solar-System and pulsar-timing experiments already restrict $|\gamma - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$, excluding any technologically useful coupling. Junction-condition analysis further shows that any interface where $\kappa$ changes demands a $\delta$-function layer of stress-energy, while even steep continuous profiles are ruled out by torsion-balance, lunar-laser, and spacecraft Doppler measurements. Hence the concept is untenable: a non-dynamical scheme violates conservation laws, and its scalar-tensor completion is falsified by existing data..</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Chaos of charged particles in quadrupole magnetic fields under Schwarzschild backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces, which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations based on the $N \times N$ hermitian two-matrix model with the introduction of a loop-counting parameter and linear terms in the potential. We show that in the large-N limit even though the Ising model is classical, the critical temperature can reach absolute zero by tuning the loop-counting parameter, and the corresponding continuum theory turns out to be the quantised theory of neither pure gravity nor gravity coupled to conformal matter with central charge being 1/2.</description>

Abstract: We study the zero-temperature criticality of the Ising model on two-dimensional dynamical triangulations to contemplate its physics. As it turns out, an inhomogeneous nature of the system yields an interesting phase diagram and the physics at the zero temperature is quite sensitive about how we cool down the system. We show the existence of a continuous parameter that characterizes the way we approach the zero-temperature critical point and it may enter in a critical exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the concept of bulk reconstruction, which involves mapping bulk operators into CFT operators to understand the emergence of spacetime and gravity. We argue that the $N=\infty$ approximation fails to capture crucial aspects of gravity, as it does not respect gauge invariance and lacks direct connections between energy and boundary metrics. Key concepts such as entanglement wedge reconstruction and holographic error correction codes, which are based on the $N=\infty$ theory, may be incorrect or require significant revision when finite $N$ effects are considered. We present explicit examples demonstrating discrepancies in bulk reconstructions and suggest that a gauge-invariant approach is necessary for an accurate understanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, possible hints of parity violation have been observed in the connected galaxy four-point correlation function. Although the true origin of the signal from the analysis has been debated, should they have a physical origin, they might point to primordial non-Gaussianity and would be evidence of new physics.
  In this work, we examine the single-field slow-roll model of inflation within chiral scalar-tensor theories of modified gravity. These theories, treated here as new Lorentz-breaking theories, extend the Chern-Simons one by including parity-violating operators containing first and second derivatives of the non-minimally coupled scalar (inflaton) field. This model is capable of imprinting parity-violating signatures in late-time observables, such as the galaxy four-point correlation function. We perform an analysis of the graviton-mediated scalar trispectrum of the gauge-invariant curvature perturbation $\zeta(t,\mathbf{x})$ using one of the parity-violating operators of these theories as a case study. We estimate that for a set of parameters of the theory it is possible to produce a signal-to-noise ratio for the parity-violating part of the trispectrum of order one without introducing modifications to the single-field slow-roll setup. Even if the signal found in the analysis turns out to be spurious or if no parity violation is ever detected in the galaxy four-point correlation function, our analysis can be used to constrain the free parameters of these theories.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic stability from Lorentzian path integrals and codimension-two singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has previously been shown how the gravitational thermal partition function can be obtained from a Lorentzian path integral. Unlike the Euclidean case, the integration contour over Lorentzian metrics is not immediately ruled out by the conformal factor problem. One can then ask whether this contour can be deformed to pick up nontrivial contributions from various saddle points. In Einstein-Maxwell theory, we argue that the relevance of each black hole saddle to the thermal partition function depends on its thermodynamic stability against variations in energy, angular momentum, and charge. The argument involves consideration of constrained saddles where area and quantities associated with angular momentum and charge are fixed on a codimension-two surface. Consequently, this surface possesses not only a conical singularity, but two other types of singularities. The latter are characterized by shifts along the surface and along the Maxwell gauge group acquired as one winds around near the surface in a metric-orthogonal and connection-horizontal manner. We first study this enlarged class of codimension-two singularities in generality and propose an action for singular configurations. We then incorporate these configurations into the path integral calculation of the partition function, focusing on three-dimensional spacetimes to simplify the treatment of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The thermal index of neutron-star matter in the virial approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by gravitational wave observations of binary neutron-star mergers, we study the thermal index of low-density, high-temperature dense matter. We use the virial expansion to account for nuclear interaction effects. We focus on the region of validity of the expansion, which reaches $10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$ at $T=5$ MeV up to almost saturation density at $T=50$ MeV. In pure neutron matter, we find an analytical expression for the thermal index, and show that it is nearly density- and temperature-independent, within a fraction of a percent of the non-interacting, non-relativistic value of $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$. When we incorporate protons, electrons and photons, we find that the density and temperature dependence of the thermal index changes significantly. We predict a smooth transition between an electron-dominated regime with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 4/3$ at low densities to a neutron-dominated region with $\Gamma_\text{th} \approx 5/3$ at high densities. This behavior is by and large independent of proton fraction and is not affected by nuclear interactions in the region where the virial expansion converges. We model this smooth transition analytically and provide a simple but accurate parametrization of the inflection point between these regimes. When compared to tabulated realistic models of the thermal index, we find an overall agreement at high temperatures that weakens for colder matter. The discrepancies can be attributed to the missing contributions of nuclear clusters. The virial approximation provides a clear and physically intuitive framework for understanding the thermal properties of dense matter, offering a computationally efficient solution that makes it particularly well-suited for the regimes relevant to neutron star binary remnants.</description>

      <title>Running Love Numbers and the Effective Field Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive states produce higher derivative corrections to Einstein gravity in the infrared, which are encoded into operators of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity. These EFT operators modify the geometry and affect the tidal properties of black holes, either neutral or charged. A thorough analysis of the perturbative tidal deformation problem leads us to introduce a tidal Green function, which we use to derive two universal formulae that efficiently provide the constant and running Love numbers induced by the EFT. We apply these formulae to determine the tidal response of EFT-corrected non-spinning black holes induced by vector and tensor fields, reproducing existing results where available and deriving new ones. We find that neutral black hole Love numbers run classically for $l\geq 3$ while charged ones run for $l\geq2$. Insights from the Frobenius method and from EFT principles confirm that the Love number renormalization flow is a well-defined physical effect. We find that extremal black holes can have Love numbers much larger than neutral ones, up to ${\cal O}(1)$ within the EFT validity regime, and that the EFT cutoff corresponds to the exponential suppression of the Schwinger effect. We discuss the possibility of probing an Abelian dark sector through gravitational waves, considering a scenario in which dark-charged extremal black holes exist in the present-day Universe.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral Through Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and EM radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D GRMHD framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through photon emission. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ~200 orbits, starting from a separation of 20r_g and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have shown how mass continues to flow toward the binary even after the binary "decouples" from its surrounding disk, but the accretion rate onto the black holes diminishes. We have identified how the minidisks orbiting each black hole are slowly drained and eventually dissolve as the binary compresses. We confirm previous findings that the system's luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few during inspiral; however, we observe an abrupt increase by ~50% in this quantity at the time of merger, likely accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, we have demonstrated that during the inspiral, fluid ram pressure regulates the fraction of the magnetic flux transported to the binary that attaches to the black holes' horizons.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization, Geodesic Equation and Sachs-Wolfe Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

      <title>The spinning self-force EFT: 1SF waveform recursion relation and Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02025v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on recent approaches, we develop an effective field theory for the interaction of spinning particles modeling Kerr black holes within the gravitational self-force expansion. To incorporate dimensional regularization into this framework, we analyze the higher-dimensional metric arising from the minimal coupling solution, comparing it against the Myers-Perry black hole and its particle description. We then derive the 1SF self-force effective action up to quadratic order in the spin expansion, identifying a new type of spinning recoil term that arises from integrating out the heavy dynamics. Next, we study the 1SF metric perturbation both from the traditional self-force perspective and through the diagrammatic background field expansion, making contact with the radiative waveform. This leads us to consider a novel recursion relation for the curved space 1SF Compton amplitude, which we study up to one-loop in the wave regime and compare with the flat space one-loop Compton for Kerr up to quadratic order in spin. Finally, we investigate the 1SF spinning Compton amplitude in the eikonal regime, clarifying how strong-field effect -- such as the location of the separatrix -- emerge from the resummation of the perturbative weak-field expansion.</description>

      <title>False and genuine decoherence in the early universe: a local observer and time-averaged observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>

      <title>Probing the Thermodynamic Phase Structure of Black Holes through Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we attempt to explore a possible connection between thermodynamic topology and the thermodynamic geometry formulation of black hole thermodynamics. We study the topological structure of black hole thermodynamic phase spaces by calculating the Euler characteristic (EC) using four well-known thermodynamic geometries: Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), and HPEM. We interpret the Euler characteristic as an indicator of the degree of microscopic interactions within the thermodynamic system. As the system approaches the spinoidal curve, the interaction strength increases significantly, eventually driving a phase transition. Beyond the spinoidal region, the interactions begin to weaken, and the system gradually stabilizes into a new phase configuration, reflected by a corresponding change in the topological structure of the thermodynamic state space.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Relativistic Strings Propagate Without Geometric Baggage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal and dynamically consistent formulation of non-relativistic bosonic string theory in a Newton-Cartan (NC) background. Starting from a reparametrization-invariant Nambu-Goto action, we develop the Hamiltonian framework and perform a complete Dirac constraint analysis. The resulting structure exhibits first-class constraints that generate worldsheet diffeomorphisms, confirming the internal gauge consistency of the model. Using an interpolating Lagrangian, we derive a Polyakov-type action that enables a direct comparison with symmetry-based constructions known as gauging the algebra (GTA) approaches, which promote non-relativistic symmetry algebras to local symmetries. In contrast to GTA formulations, which require additional background fields to achieve algebraic closure, our model derives all necessary geometric data dynamically from the string evolution itself. This establishes that standard Newton-Cartan geometry is sufficient to support consistent non-relativistic string dynamics. Our results provide a conceptually transparent and technically robust foundation for future studies of non-relativistic string theory in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds on field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime: purity vs scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study perturbative unitarity bounds on the field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime, using the momentum-space entanglement approach recently proposed by Pueyo, Goodhew, McCulloch, and Pajer. As an illustration, we perform a perturbative computation of the purity in two-scalar models and compare the resulting unitarity bounds with those obtained via a flat space approximation. In particular, we find that perturbative unitarity imposes an upper bound on the field-space curvature of the Hubble scale order, in addition to a bound analogous to the flat space result. This reflects the thermal nature of de Sitter spacetime. We also discuss generalizations to higher-dimensional field spaces.</description>

      <title>The thermal backreaction of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature, we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then examine how these corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical backreaction and find that their sign depends on the initial conditions. In order to place our results in context, we compare them to the corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant derived in [1].</description>
