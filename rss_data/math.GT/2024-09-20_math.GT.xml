      <title>Kink-equivalence of matrices, spanning surfaces, 4-manifolds, and quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All checkerboard surfaces for a given knot in $S^3$ are related by isotopy and "kinking" and "unkinking" moves, which change the surfaces' Goeritz matrices like this: $G\leftrightarrow G\oplus [\pm1]=\left[\begin{smallmatrix} G&amp;\mathbf{0}\\ \mathbf{0}^T&amp;\pm1 \end{smallmatrix}\right]$. We call two symmetric integer matrices "kink-equivalent" if they are related by "kinking'' and "unkinking'' moves $G\leftrightarrow G\oplus [\pm1]$ and unimodular congruence. We prove constructively that every nonsingular symmetric integer matrix is kink-equivalent to a positive-definite matrix and to a negative-definite matrix, and we give bounds on the number of moves required. This has several implications, e.g. every knot in $S^3$ is "alternating up to fake unkinking moves" and every simply connected, closed, topological 4-manifold with nonsingular intersection pairing has a positive blow-up that is homeomorphic to a negative blow-up of a positive-definite, simply connected, closed, topological 4-manifold.</description>

      <title>Ribbon numbers of 12-crossing knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ribbon number of a knot is the minimum number of ribbon singularities among all ribbon disks bounded by that knot. In this paper, we build on the systematic treatment of this knot invariant initiated in recent work of Friedl, Misev, and Zupan. We show that the set of Alexander polynomials of knots with ribbon number at most four contains 56 polynomials, and we use this set to compute the ribbon numbers for many 12-crossing knots. We also study higher-genus ribbon numbers of knots, presenting some examples that exhibit interesting behavior and establishing that the success of the Alexander polynomial at controlling genus-0 ribbon numbers does not extend to higher genera.</description>

      <title>Topological normal generation of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological group $G$ is topologically normally generated if there is $g \in G$ such that the normal closure of $g$ is dense in $G$. Suppose $S$ is a tame, infinite type surface whose $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is CB generated. We prove that if the end space of $S$ is countable, then $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated if and only if $S$ is uniquely self-similar. Moreover, if the end space of $S$ is uncountable, we give a sufficient condition for $S$ that $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated. As a result, we provide uncountably many examples, each of which is not telescoping and $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated. We also proved the semidirect product structure of $\mathrm{FMap}(S)$, which is a subgroup of $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ that fixes all isolated maximal ends pointwise. Finally we show that the minimum number of normal generators of $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is bounded both below and above by constants, which both depending only on the topology of $S$. The upper bound grows quadratically with respect to the constant.</description>

      <title>Flat extensions and the Chern-Simons $3$-form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

      <title>Abelian TQFTS and Schr\"odinger local systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an action of 3-cobordisms on the finite dimensional Schr\"odinger representations of the Heisenberg group by Lagrangian correspondences. In addition, we review the construction of the abelian Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) associated with a $q$-deformation of $U(1)$ for any root of unity $q$. We prove that for3-cobor\-disms compatible with Lagrangian correspondences, there is a normalization of the associated Schr\"odinger bimodule action that reproduces the abelian TQFT. The full abelian TQFT provides a projective representation of the mapping class group $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma)$ on the Schr\"odinger representation,which is linearizable at odd root of 1. Motivated by homology of surface configurations with Schr\"odinger representation as local coefficients, we define another projective action of $\mathrm{Mod}(\Sigma)$ on Schr\"odinger representations. We show that the latter is not linearizable by identifying the associated 2-cocycle.</description>

      <title>Volume bounds for hyperbolic rod complements in the 3-torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of rod complements is motivated by rod packing structures in crystallography. We view them as complements of links comprised of Euclidean geodesics in the 3-torus. Recent work of the second author classifies when such rod complements admit hyperbolic structures, but their geometric properties are yet to be well understood. In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds for the volumes of all hyperbolic rod complements in terms of rod parameters, and show that these bounds may be loose in general. We introduce better and asymptotically sharp volume bounds for a family of rod complements. The bounds depend only on the lengths of the continued fractions formed from the rod parameters.</description>

      <title>On the Weyl problem for complete surfaces in the hyperbolic and anti-de Sitter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Weyl problem (solved by Lewy, Alexandrov, Pogorelov, and others) asks whether any metric of curvature $K\geq 0$ on the sphere is induced on the boundary of a unique convex body in $\R^3$. The answer was extended to surfaces in hyperbolic space by Alexandrov in the 1950s, and a ``dual'' statement, describing convex bodies in terms of the third fundamental form of their boundary (e.g. their dihedral angles, for an ideal polyhedron) was later proved.
  We describe three conjectural generalizations of the Weyl problem in $\HH^3$ and its dual to unbounded convex subsets and convex surfaces, in ways that are relevant to contemporary geometry since a number of recent results and well-known open problems can be considered as special cases. One focus is on convex domain having a ``thin'' asymptotic boundary, for instance a quasicircle -- this part of the problem is strongly related to the theory of Kleinian groups. A second direction is towards convex subsets with a ``thick'' ideal boundary, for instance a disjoint union of disks -- here one find connections to problems in complex analysis, such as the Koebe circle domain conjecture. A third direction is towards complete, convex disks of infinite area in $\HH^3$ and surfaces in hyperbolic ends -- with connections to questions on circle packings or grafting on the hyperbolic disk. Similar statements are proposed in anti-de Sitter geometry, a Lorentzian cousin of hyperbolic geometry where interesting new phenomena can occur, and in Minkowski and Half-pipe geometry. We also collect some partial new results mostly based on recent works.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the absolute period foliation of a stratum of holomorphic 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a connected component of a stratum of the moduli space of holomorphic $1$-forms of genus $g$. We show that the absolute period foliation of $\mathcal{C}$ is ergodic on the area-$1$ locus, and that the non-dense leaves lie in an explicit countable union of suborbifolds, subject to a mild assumption on $\mathcal{C}$. We show similar results for subspaces of $\mathcal{C}$ defined by topological restrictions on the absolute periods. We obtain these dynamical results by showing that for a typical positive cohomology class in $H^1(S_g;\mathbb{C})$, the associated space of isoperiodic forms in $\mathcal{C}$ is connected. Lastly, we show that certain covering constructions provide examples of spaces of isoperiodic forms with positive dimension and infinitely many connected components.</description>

      <title>Unstability problem of real analytic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As well-known, the $C^\infty$ stability of proper $C^\infty$ maps is characterized by the infinitesimal $C^\infty$ stability. In the present paper we study the counterpart in real analytic context. In particular, we show that the infinitesimal $C^\omega$ stability does not imply $C^\omega$ stability; for instance, a Whitney umbrella $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is not $C^\omega$ stable. A main tool for the proof is a relative version of Whitney's Analytic Approximation Theorem which is shown by using H. Cartan's Theorems A and B.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Cohen-Jones-Segal construction in Morse-Bott theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1995, Cohen, Jones and Segal proposed a method of upgrading any given Floer homology to a stable homotopy-valued invariant. For a generic pseudo-gradient Morse-Bott flow on a closed smooth manifold $M$, we rigorously construct the conjectural stable normal framings, which are an essential ingredient in their construction, and give a rigorous proof that the resulting stable homotopy type recovers $\Sigma^\infty_+ M$. We further show that one can recover Thom spectra $M^E$ for all reduced $KO$-theory classes $E$ on $M$, by using slightly modified stable normal framings. Our paper also includes a construction of the smooth corner structure on compactified moduli spaces of broken flow lines with free endpoint, a formal construction of Piunikhin-Salamon-Schwarz type continuation maps, and a way to relax the stable normal framing condition to orientability in orthogonal spectra.</description>
