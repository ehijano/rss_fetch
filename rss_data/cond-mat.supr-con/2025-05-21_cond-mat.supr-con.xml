      <title>Quasiparticles and optical conductivity in the mixed state of Weyl superconductors with unconventional pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC) and the two-dimensional (2D) nodal superconductor, realized through a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure, can exhibit a Dirac-like Landau level (LL) structure that scales with $\sqrt{n}$ in the presence of a vortex lattice, where $n$ is the index of the LLs. Here, we investigate the excitation spectrum in the mixed state of WeylSCs with unconventional pairing and find that, unlike in the spin-singlet case, QP bands for the spin-triplet pairing show surprising dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Different pairing symmetries in WeylSCs also result in distinct magneto-optical responses, manifested as characterized magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also reveal that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the vortex of a superconductor heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Lorentz force on superconducting vortices near line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In type-II superconductors, magnetic flux penetrates in the form of quantized vortices whose dissipative motion, driven by the Lorentz force, can degrade superconductivity. Understanding vortex dynamics in both homogeneous regions and near unavoidable structural defects is crucial for superconducting applications. This study examines a scenario in which a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) scans across a thin-film superconductor containing line defects. We first estimate the radial Lorentz force on a vortex in a homogeneous region using both analytical methods and numerical simulations based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm. For a film with a Pearl length of 400 micrometers and a SQUID height of 4 micrometers, we find that the SQUID tip can exert a force of approximately 3 femtonewtons on a vortex. We then evaluate the Lorentz force on vortices near two parallel line defects. Our results show that the Lorentz force is enhanced for vortices pinned on or between line defects. Vortices pinned on the line defects experience force enhancement predominantly perpendicular to the defects, while vortices in between experience enhancement along the defect direction. These findings enable more accurate estimation of Lorentz forces on vortices near line defects in thin-film superconductors and contribute to the broader understanding of vortex pinning and dynamics in defect-engineered superconductors. The methods can be extended to bulk superconductors and generalized to other defect geometries.</description>

      <title>Topological electron and phonon flat bands in novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Superconducting properties of thin film $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ studied via the NMR of implanted $^8$Li</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the normal-state and superconducting properties of thin-film $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$ using $^{8}$Li $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR). In these experiments, radioactive $^{8}$Li$^{+}$ probes were implanted $\sim21$ nm below the surface of a $\mathrm{Nb_{1-x}Ti_xN}$(91 nm) film in $\mathrm{Nb_{0.75}Ti_{0.25}N}$(91 nm)/AlN(4 nm)/Nb and its NMR response recorded (via $^{8}$Li's $\beta$-emissions) between 4.6 K and 270 K in a 4.1 T field applied normal to its surface. Resonance measurements reveal wide, symmetric lineshapes at all temperatures, with significant additional broadening below the film's superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}(0 \; \mathrm{T}) = 15.4 \pm 0.7$ K due to vortex lattice formation. Fits to a broadening model find a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(0 \; \mathrm{K})= 180.57 \pm 0.30$ nm and upper critical field $B_\mathrm{c2}(0 \; \mathrm{K})= 18 \pm 4$ T, consistent with literature estimates. Spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) measurements find a Korringa response at low temperatures, with dynamic (i.e., thermally activated) contributions dominating above $\sim100$ K. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, we observe a small Hebel-Slichter coherence peak characterized by a superconducting energy gap $\Delta(0 \; \mathrm{K}) = 2.60 \pm 0.12$ meV and modest Dynes-like broadening. Our measurements suggest a gap ratio $2\Delta(0 \; \mathrm{K})/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{c}(0 \; \mathrm{T}) = 3.92 \pm 0.25$, consistent with strong-coupling behavior. Sources for the dynamic high-$T$ relaxation are suggested.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic dependence of $T_c$ on the c axis compression in the HTSC cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the the $c$ axis compression on the electronic structure and superconducting properties of the HTSC cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ at different doping is investigated. The electronic structure of quasiparticle excitations is obtained within the effective five-band Hubbard model using the equation of motion method for Green's functions builded on the Hubbard operators. The superconducting gap and ${T_c}$ are calculated taking into account the exchange pairing mechanism involving not only the Zhang-Rice singlet but also excited two-hole triplet and singlet states. The energy of the $a_{1g}$ orbitals increases with increasing compression and the $a_{1g}$ quasiparticle bands begin to strongly interact with the $b_{1g}$ bands at the top of the valence band. The reconstruction of the region of states determining the superconducting properties results in the high density of states near the Fermi level. This mechanism leads to an increase in $T_c$ in the underdoped region with increasing compression. The pairing constants renormalizations under compression results in ${T_c}$ decreasing. The competition of these two effects leads to non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ under the $c$-axis compression near optimal doping.</description>

      <title>Charge and magnetic orders in a two-band model with long-range interactions for infinite-layer nickelates NdNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an effective two-band model for infinite-layer nickelates NdNiO$_2$ that consisting of a $d$ band centered at Ni site and an interstitial $s$-like band centered at Nd site. To the large extent of the wave functions, we find intersite Coulomb interactions to be substantial. We then use the variational cluster approach together with mean-field theory to investigate magnetic and charge ordering. While tendencies towards charge modulation are found, they are weak and might be due to finite-size effects. Magnetic order is determined mostly by the filling of the $d$ band and hardly affected by including longer-ranged interactions. For a $d$-band density consistent with density-functional theory, magnetic ordering vanishes once quantum fluctuations are included to a sufficient spatial extent. Apart from self-doping, $d$ and $s$ bands remain largely uncoupled despite the presence of inter-orbital Coulomb interaction and (small) inter-orbital hopping.</description>

      <title>A Strong-Coupling-Limit Study on the Pairing Mechanism in the Pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the bilayer perovskite nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has been reported to exhibit high-temperature superconductivity near $80$ K under a moderate pressure of about $14$GPa. To investigate the underlying pairing mechanism and symmetry in this complex system, we propose and analyze a mixed spin-$1$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ bilayer $t$-$J$ model in the strong coupling regime. This model explicitly incorporates the crucial role of strong Hund's coupling, which favors the formation of local spin-triplet states from the two onsite $E_g$ orbital electrons at half-filling. We further investigate the model using both slave-particle mean-field theory and the density matrix renormalization group method. Our simulation results reveal that the dominate pairing channel is the interlayer one in the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The Hund's coupling is shown to enhance superconductivity within a reasonable physical range. Moreover, electron doping strengthens superconductivity by increasing carrier density; in contrast, hole doping weakens superconductivity. These findings offer critical insights into the unconventional superconductivity of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and underline the important role of orbital-selective behavior and Hund's rule.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cross-layer composite spins in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure and possible routes to enhance its superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has been recently found to exhibit superconductivity in its high-pressure phase, similar to the previously discovered bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but with a notably lower transition temperature. To date the pressure effects on the electronic correlations beneficial for unconventional superconductivity remains unclear, as well as the potential similarities or differences compared to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We use a multi-energy-scale derivation of the inter-layer electron dynamics to identify the dominant emergent spin-charge correlations in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Similar to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find fractionalization of ionic spins in the high-pressure phase that results in cuprate-like spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ ions correlated with itinerant carriers. This suggests a similar superconducting mechanism in other nickelate and cuprate superconductors. Interestingly, extra composite spins emerge as cross-layer trimers in the trilayer system, whose suppression of ionic spin fluctuations naturally explains the weaker superconductivity observed in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and indicates that lowering layer symmetry is a viable strategy to improve superconductivity in this trilayer nickelate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1812.05907v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory describing parametric amplification in a Josephson junction embedded transmission line. We will focus on the process of four-wave mixing under the assumption of an undepleted pump. However, the approach taken is quite general, such that a different parametric process or the process under different assumptions is easily derived. First the classical theory of the coupled-mode equations as presented by O'Brien et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{113}:157001$] is shortly reviewed. Then a derivation of the full quantum theory is given using mesoscopic quantisation techniques in terms of discrete mode operators. This results in a Hamiltonian that describes the process of parametric amplification. We show that the coupled-mode equations can be derived from this Hamiltonian in the classical limit and elaborate on the validity of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Here we show that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also demonstrate that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows control over the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.</description>
