      <title>Influence of Magnetic Field on Surface Andreev Bound States in Superfluid $^3$He-B Studied by Mobility of Electron Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The B phase of superfluid $^\textrm 3$He ($^\textrm 3$He-B) is topologically nontrivial and the surface Andreev bound states formed on a surface are conceived as Majorana fermions. In a magnetic field, the surface Andreev bound states acquire a Zeeman gap. How the Zeeman gap opens when a magnetic field is applied is intimately related to how the topological properties are lost. In this article, we study the mobility of an electron bubble trapped under a free surface of $^\textrm 3$He-B in a magnetic field of 0.25 T to examine the influence of the magnetic field on the surface Andreev bound states. We observe experimentally and theoretically that, with decreasing temperature, the mobility at 0.25 T increases steeper than that in zero magnetic field when the thermal energy is comparable to the Zeeman energy, while the mobility is slightly smaller than that in zero magnetic field at higher temperatures. These features are understood by the opening of the Zeeman gap, the resulting change in the density of states within the bulk superfluid gap, and the distortion of the bulk superfluid gap by the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Splitting of nonequilibrium phase transitions in driven Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in various equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, where phase transitions are typically marked by a single critical point that separates ordered and disordered regimes. We reveal a novel phenomenon in which the interplay between different temperatures and driving forces splits the order-disorder transition into two distinct transition points depending on which ordered state initially dominates. Crucially, these two emerging phases have distinct scaling behaviors and thermodynamic properties. To study this, we propose a minimal variant of the Ising model where spins are coupled to two thermal baths and subjected to two opposite driving forces associated to them. Our findings, robust both for all-to-all interactions (where exact solutions are possible) and nearest-neighbor couplings on a square lattice, uncover unique nonequilibrium behaviors and scaling laws for crucial thermodynamic quantities, such as efficiency, dissipation, power and its fluctuations, that are different between the two ordered phases. We also highlight that one of these emerging phases enables heat-engine operations that are less dissipative and show reduced fluctuations. In this setup, the system can also operate near maximum power and efficiency over a wide parameter range. Our results offer new insights into the relevance of phase transitions under nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Universal description of massive point vortices and verification methods of vortex inertia in superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex mass, which is the inertia of a quantum vortex, has never been observed in superfluids and is a long-standing problem in low temperature physics. The impact of the mass is considered negligible in typical experiments with superfluid $^4$He. Recent developments of experimental techniques for manipulating quantum vortices in superfluid atomic gases have enabled us to test this problem more accurately. By introducing the vortex mass time and length as universal scales to many-body problems of massive quantum vortices, the theoretical description is formulated in the simplest manner and is universally applicable to different quantum fluids, including fermionic and multicomponent superfluids. There are two branches, the cyclotron and massless branches, for the circular motion of a pair of like-sign vortices. Finding a stable cyclotron branch for the motion of vortices is a clear evidence of vortex mass and superfluid $^3$He-B is the specific example of a system where this phenomena could be observed. The impact of the mass on the massless branch is small but can be enhanced by taking the difference in the two-body dynamics of point vortices with different initial conditions. Our results imply that the vortex mass is a direct cause of the splitting instability of a doubly quantized vortex at absolute zero and that the vortex mass length characterizes the final state after the instability. It is also demonstrated that a pair of massive vortices with opposite circulations has a critical distance characterized by the vortex mass length, below which they are spontaneously annihilated without thermal fluctuations.</description>
