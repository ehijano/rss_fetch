      <title>Reallocation of Nonlocal Entanglement in Incommensurate Cold Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold atom arrays in optical lattices offer a highly tunable platform for exploring complex quantum phenomena that are difficult to realize in conventional materials. Here, we investigate the emergence of controllable long-range quantum correlations in a simulated twisted bilayer structure with fermionic cold atoms. By exploiting the incommensurate nature of the twisted bilayer, we observe a significant enhancement of long-range susceptibility, suggesting the formation of stable entangled states between spatially distant localized spins. We further show that the tunability of the interlayer coupling in terms of driving fields enables us to manipulate these entangled states without deformation of lattice structure and extra doping. Our findings provide a pathway for overcoming challenges in establishing strong correlations across distant sites, highlighting the potential of optical lattices as a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Reduced density matrix approach to one-dimensional ultracold bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational determination of the two-boson reduced density matrix is described for a one-dimensional system of $N$ (where $N$ ranges from $2$ to $10^4$) harmonically trapped bosons interacting via contact interaction. The ground-state energies are calculated, and compared to existing methods in the field, including the analytic case (for $N=2)$ and mean-field approaches such as the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its variations. Structural properties including the density and correlation functions are also derived, including the behaviour of the correlation function when boson coordinates coincide, collectively demonstrating the capacity of the reduced density matrix method to accurately calculate ground-state properties of bosonic systems comprising few to many bosons, including the cross-over region between these extremes, across a large range of interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Intraspecies Scattering Length on the Observability of Resonances in Efimov-Unfavored Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efimov resonances in the three-body loss rate have been observed in ultracold heteronuclear gases near interspecies Feshbach resonances. However, the intraspecies scattering length $a_\text{BB}$ has been assumed to have a negligible effect on the overall Efimov scenario, namely, on the locations of the Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and, consequently, on the three-body parameter (3BP). The present Letter analyzes the influence of $a_\text{BB}$ on the Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$, particularly the 3BP, in Efimov-unfavored systems. Using van der Waals interactions described by separable $s$-wave potentials, the unitarity energy spectrum ($|a_\text{BX}|\rightarrow\infty$) and the Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$ for $^{23}\text{Na}_2^{40}\text{K}$ are mapped out in $a_\text{BB}$. It is found that both the magnitude and sign of $a_\text{BB}$ can significantly impact the resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ in Efimov-unfavored systems, with the 3BP taking an observable value when $a_\text{BB}&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

      <title>Many exact area-law scar eigenstates in the nonintegrable PXP and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</description>

      <title>Synthetic half-integer magnetic monopole and single-vortex dynamics in spherical Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here, we come up with a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</description>
