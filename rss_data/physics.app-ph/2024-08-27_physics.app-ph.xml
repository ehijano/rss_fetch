      <title>Mode-Dependent Scaling of Nonlinearity and Linear Dynamic Range in a NEMS Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even a relatively weak drive force is enough to push a typical nanomechanical resonator into the nonlinear regime. Consequently, nonlinearities are widespread in nanomechanics and determine the critical characteristics of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonators. A thorough understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of higher eigenmodes of NEMS resonators would be beneficial for progress, given their use in applications and fundamental studies. Here, we characterize the nonlinearity and the linear dynamic range (LDR) of each eigenmode of two nanomechanical beam resonators with different intrinsic tension values up to eigenmode $n=11$. We find that the modal Duffing constant increases as $n^4$, while the critical amplitude for the onset of nonlinearity decreases as $1/n$. The LDR, determined from the ratio of the critical amplitude to the thermal noise amplitude, increases weakly with $n$. Our findings are consistent with our theory treating the beam as a string, with the nonlinearity emerging from stretching at high amplitudes. These scaling laws, observed in experiments and validated theoretically, can be leveraged for pushing the limits of NEMS-based sensing even further.</description>

      <title>Accurate Performance Characterization, Reporting, and Benchmarking for Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) provide an increasingly promising solution for powering Internet-of-Things smart devices, which has led to a surge in IPV research and the development of new IPV technologies. However, the diverse lighting scenarios adopted in IPV research pose unique challenges in characterization, reporting, and benchmarking, which may obscure genuine performance improvements and result in inaccurate conclusions due to characterization errors. Spectral variations among artificial light sources further complicate benchmarking. This study provides a comprehensive, quantitative analysis of these challenges, investigating them through experimental characterization of IPVs covering a broad performance parameter space, including c-Si, a-Si:H, perovskite, and organic devices. We reveal that many of these challenges can lead to unacceptable error levels. A particularly critical issue is the angular interplay among the light source, measuring device, and IPV device, which compromises accuracy under diffuse illumination. To address these challenges, we evaluate practical protocols to overcome angular issues and enable benchmarking against standardized spectral conditions. To facilitate the implementation of our findings, we provide comprehensive checklists for accurate IPV characterization, reporting, and benchmarking. We anticipate that our analyses and guidelines will stimulate further advancements in IPV technologies by ensuring reliable performance evaluation, thereby facilitating the realization of IPVs' full potential.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field near the common edge of a perfectly conducting wedge and a resistive half-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the electromagnetic field near the common edge of a resistive half-plane and a perfectly conducting wedge is investigated. The possible appearance of logarithmic functions besides power terms in the field expansions at the certain angles between a resistive half-plane and the faces of the wedge is indicated. It is shown that in the main terms of the electric or magnetic field components perpendicular to the edge, logarithmic functions appear only in two particular cases: when a half-plane forms a straight angle with one of the faces of the wedge, or when the external angle of the conducting wedge is a right one. Otherwise, the main terms of all components have a purely power character and can be determined by the Meixner method. To confirm the efficiency of accounting for the found field distribution law, transversal wave numbers of the dominant mode of a rectangular waveguide with a resistive film in a diagonal plane is calculated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NFC and RFID technologies have seen significant advancements, with expanding applications necessitating the design of novel antenna structures that enhance range capabilities. This paper presents a study on the design and impedance matching of long-range NFC coils, focusing on optimizing antenna performance over distances exceeding one meter. Through numerical analyses of various coil geometries, including single-turn and multi-wire configurations, we explore the effects of coil size, wire separation, and current distribution on magnetic field generation. Additionally, an adaptive impedance matching approach is proposed to maintain efficient power transfer, significantly improving field strength and system performance. The proposed designs demonstrate superior interrogation distances compared to existing configurations, highlighting the potential for enhanced long-range NFC applications.</description>

      <title>Selective-injection GaN Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors with 275 kA/cm$^2$ Current Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and demonstrate selective injection GaN heterojunction bipolar transistors that utilize a patterned base for selective injection of electrons from the emitter. The design maneuvers minority carrier injection through a thin p-GaN base region, while the majority carrier holes for base current are injected from thick p-GaN regions adjacent to the thin p-GaN base. The design is realized using a regrowth emitter approach with SiO$_2$ as a spacer between the emitter layer and the thick p-GaN base contact regions. The fabricated device demonstrated state-of-art output current density (I$_{C, max}$) ~275 kA/cm$^2$ with a current gain ($\beta$) of 9, and 17 for the planar HBT design (I$_{C, max}$ =150 kA/cm$^2$). The reported results highlight the potential of the selective injection design to overcome the persistent GaN HBT design tradeoff between base resistance and current gain, paving the way for next-generation radio frequency and mm-Wave applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering biphoton spectral wavefunction in a silicon micro-ring resonator with split resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-time is a degree of freedom suitable for photonic high-dimensional entanglement, with advantages such as compatibility with single-mode devices and insensitivity to dispersion. The engineering control of the frequency-time amplitude of a photon's electric field has been demonstrated on platforms with second-order optical nonlinearity. For integrated photonic platforms with only third-order optical nonlinearity, the engineered generation of the state remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced photon-pair source on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform that can generate both separable states and controllable entangled states in the frequency domain without post-manipulation. By choosing different resonance combinations and employing on-chip optical field differentiation, we achieve independent control over two functions that affect the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the state. A semi-analytical model is derived to simulate the biphoton spectral wavefunction in the presence of resonance splitting and pump differentiation, and its parameters can be fully determined through fitting-based parameter extraction from the resonator's measured linear response. The measured spectral purity for the separable state is $95.5\pm 1.2\%$, while the measured JSIs for the entangled states show two- or four-peaked functions in two-dimensional frequency space. The experiments and simulations demonstrate the capacity to manipulate the frequency-domain wavefunction in a silicon-based device, which is promising for applications like quantum information processing using pulsed temporal-mode encoding or long-distance quantum key distribution.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Photonic Crystal Structure Enhanced External-Magnetic-Field-Free Spintronic Terahertz High-Field Emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense terahertz (THz) radiation in free space offers multifaceted capabilities for accelerating electron, understanding the mesoscale architecture in (bio)materials, elementary excitation and so on. Recently popularized spintronic THz emitters (STEs) with their versatility such as ultra-broadband, cost-effectiveness, large-size and ease for-integration have become one of the most promising alternative for the next generation of intense THz sources. Nevertheless, the typical W| Co20Fe60B20 | Pt necessitates an external-magnetic-field to saturate magnetization for stable operation, limiting its scalability for achieving higher THz field with uniform distribution over larger sample areas. Here we demonstrate the methodologies of enhancing the high-field THz radiation of external-magnetic-field-free IrMn3 | Co20Fe60B20 |W heterostructure via optimizing the substrate with superior thermal conductivity and integrating a one-dimensional photonic crystal (PC) structure to maximize the radiation efficiency. Under the excitation of a Ti: sapphire femtosecond laser amplifier with central wavelength of 800 nm, pulse duration of 35 fs, and repetition rate of 1 kHz and maximum single pulse energy of 5.5 mJ, we successfully generate intense THz radiation with focal peak electric field up to 1.1 MV/cm with frequency range covering 0.1-10 THz without external-magnetic-fields. These high-field STEs will also enable other applications such as ultra-broadband high-field THz spectroscopy and polarization-based large-size strong-field THz imaging.</description>

      <title>Tension-induced giant actuation in unstructured elastic sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buckling is normally associated with a compressive load applied to a slender structure; from railway tracks in extreme heat [1] to microtubules in cytoplasm [2], axial compression is relieved by out-of-plane buckling. However, recent studies have demonstrated that tension applied to structured thin sheets leads to transverse motion that may be harnessed for novel applications. For instance, tension in one direction can actuate motion in an orthogonal direction, enabling the creation of kirigami grippers [3], `groovy metasheets' for multi-stable morphing [4], and lateral bending of ribbed sheets [5]. Qualitatively similar behaviour has also been observed in simulations of thermalized graphene sheets [6,7], where clamping along one edge leads to tilting in the transverse direction. Here, we show that this counter-intuitive behaviour is, in fact, generic for thin sheets that have a relatively low stretching modulus compared to the bending modulus, which allows `giant actuation' with moderate strain. Indeed, transverse buckling can be induced by uni-axial tension even in unstructured elastic sheets, provided that the axial loading is sufficiently close to localized. We therefore refer to this as `Tension indUced Giant actuation' (TUG actuation) and study its properties. We show that TUG actuation occurs because of an efficient transfer of applied tensile load into compression and determine scaling results for the transverse angle as a function of applied strain; our scaling results compare favorably with both experiments and simulations. Our findings suggest that controlled buckling in tension can be utilized in a broader range of materials and structures to give TUG actuation, potentially expanding the scope of its application in material science and engineering.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising candidate for various quantum applications, such as quantum sensing. High sensitivity in NV-based magnetic sensing requires a diamond sample with a high density of NV centers and a long electron spin dephasing time. In this work, we propose a systematic measurement method for determining the electron spin dephasing time of NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions to the dephasing time from various sources, including NV-NV interactions, strain distribution, $^{13}C$ nuclear spin, and P1 electron spin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a series of high-performance diamond samples and provide a comprehensive understanding of dephasing sources, enabling the optimization of NV-based quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Design of Au-Based Alloys for Improved Plasmon Delivery and Nanoheating in Near-Field Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic near-field transducers (NFTs) play a key role in administering nanoscale heating for a number of applications ranging from medical devices to next generation data processing technology. We present a novel multi-scale approach, combining quantum many-body perturbation theory with finite-element modelling, to predict the electric and thermal material parameters of various Au-based, noble metal (M) alloys. Specifically, we focus on modelling their performance within an NFT designed to focus high-intensity, sub-diffracted light for technologies such as nanoscale etching, manipulation, sensing, and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). Elemental Au is the long-standing general-purpose NFT medium due its excellent plasmonic performance at relevant wavelengths. However, elemental Au is a soft, ductile material that tends to extrude and deform in response to extreme temperature gradients. Therefore, alloying Au with other noble metals such as Ag, Cu, Pd or Pt, has attracted considerable interest for improved mechanical and thermal robustness while reaching threshold plasmonic generation at standard optoelectronics operating wavelengths (e.g., $\approx 830$~nm) and approximate high-power NFT temperatures ($\approx 400$~K). We predict that certain Au-Ag alloys may offer improved thermal stability as whole-NFT media compared to elemental Au, alongside plasmonic figures of merit comparable to that of Au. Simulations of certain solid solution Au-Pd/Pt alloys enable us to predict significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. We predict that alloying with Pd at low concentrations $\sim 10\%$ may preserve the NFT performance of Au, while offering the benefits of improved thermal and mechanical stability.</description>

Abstract: Fast and accurate detection of light in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range plays a crucial role in modern society, from alleviating speed and capacity bottlenecks in optical communications to enhancing the control and safety of autonomous vehicles through NIR imaging systems. Several technological platforms are currently under investigation to improve NIR photodetection, aiming to surpass the performance of established III-V semiconductor p-i-n (PIN) junction technology. These platforms include in situ-grown inorganic nanocrystals and nanowire arrays, as well as hybrid organic-inorganic materials such as graphene-perovskite heterostructures. However, challenges remain in nanocrystal and nanowire growth, large-area fabrication of high-quality 2D materials, and the fabrication of devices for practical applications. Here, we explore the potential for tailored semiconductor nanocrystals to enhance the responsivity of planar metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors. MSM technology offers ease of fabrication and fast response times compared to PIN detectors. We observe enhancement of the optical-to-electric conversion efficiency by up to a factor of ~2.5 through the application of plasmonically-active semiconductor nanorods and nanocrystals. We present a protocol for synthesizing and rapidly testing the performance of non-stoichiometric tungsten oxide (WO$_{3-x}$) nanorods and cesium-doped tungsten oxide (Cs$_y$WO$_{3-x}$) hexagonal nanoprisms prepared in colloidal suspensions and drop-cast onto photodetector surfaces. The results demonstrate the potential for a cost-effective and scalable method exploiting tailored nanocrystals to improve the performance of NIR optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>The Quantization Monte Carlo method for solving radiative transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantization Monte Carlo method to solve thermal radiative transport equations with possibly several collision regimes, ranging from few collisions to massive number of collisions per time unit. For each particle in a given simulation cell, the proposed method advances the time by replacing many collisions with sampling directly from the escape distribution of the particle. In order to perform the sampling, for each triplet of parameters (opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid, the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized (i.e., discrete) version by choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's parameters) and returning at random one quantile from the precomputed set of quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a benchmark with good results.</description>

Abstract: Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.</description>

      <title>Shock waves in nonlinear transmission lines</title>

Abstract: In the first half of the paper we consider interaction between the small amplitude travelling waves ("sound") and the shock waves in the transmission line containing both nonlinear capacitors and nonlinear inductors. We calculate the "sound" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission through) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the speeds of the "sound" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In the second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the dissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors and also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the conditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also allows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study their profiles. In some particular cases the profiles were obtained in terms of elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast modulation of guided-mode resonance in a nonlinear silicon nitride grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10792</link>

Abstract: Nonlinear optical interactions in nanostructures are essential for both fundamental research and practical applications. The optical Kerr effect, a third-order nonlinear optical phenomenon, induces anisotropic changes in the refractive index of a material when exposed to high-intensity laser beams. However, the relatively modest magnitude of this effect limits its practical application in free-space nanophotonics. In this study, we achieve an enhancement of the optical Kerr effect by over three orders of magnitude using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric diffraction grating. Our work includes the design, fabrication, and measurement of the transmittance of a resonant silicon nitride (SiNx) crossed grating illuminated with short light pulses. We observe spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power, resulting in more than fifty percent modulation of the resonance magnitude. Additionally, this study investigates the potential of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping. The presented results unveil promises in the development of next-generation all-optical devices, leveraging enhanced Kerr nonlinearities in dielectric gratings.</description>
