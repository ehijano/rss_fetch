      <title>Vortex Fiber Nulling for Exoplanet Observations: First Direct Detection of M Dwarf Companions around HIP 21543, HIP 94666, and HIP 50319</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex fiber nulling (VFN) is a technique for detecting and characterizing faint companions at small separations from their host star. A near-infrared ($\sim2.3 \mu$m) VFN demonstrator mode was deployed on the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) instrument at the Keck Observatory and presented earlier. In this paper, we present the first VFN companion detections. Three targets, HIP 21543 Ab, HIP 94666 Ab, and HIP 50319 B, were detected with host-companion flux ratios between 70 and 430 at and within one diffraction beamwidth ($\lambda/D$). We complement the spectra from KPIC VFN with flux ratio and position measurements from the CHARA Array to validate the VFN results and provide a more complete characterization of the targets. This paper reports the first direct detection of these three M dwarf companions, yielding their first spectra and flux ratios. Our observations provide measurements of bulk properties such as effective temperatures, radial velocities, and v$\sin{i}$, and verify the accuracy of the published orbits. These detections corroborate earlier predictions of the KPIC VFN performance, demonstrating that the instrument mode is ready for science observations.</description>

      <title>VLBI Astrometry of Radio Stars to Link Radio and Optical Celestial Reference Frames: Observing Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia celestial reference frame (Gaia-CRF) will benefit from a close assessment with independent methods, such as Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements of radio stars at bright magnitudes. However, obtaining full astrometric parameters for each radio star through VLBI measurements demands a significant amount of observation time. This study proposes an efficient observing strategy that acquires double-epoch VLBI positions to measure the positions and proper motions of radio stars at a reduced cost. The solution for CRF link compatible with individual VLBI position measurements is introduced, and the optimized observing epoch scheduling is discussed. Applying this solution to observational data yields results sensitive to sample increase or decrease, yet they remain consistently in line with the literature at the 1-sigma level. This suggests the potential for improvement with a larger sample size. Simulations for adding observations demonstrate the double-epoch strategy reduces CRF link parameter uncertainties by over 30% compared to the five-parameter strategy.</description>

      <title>Short review on the refractive index of air as a function of temperature, pressure, humidity and ionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The empirical law of Gladstone-Dale is insufficient for high-precision studies using the refractivity of a gas: this is not exactly proportional to its density, and the gas may not be properly described as perfect. An optical Mariotte temperature allows making a comparative analysis of the results given by various authors. The effect of hygrometry on the refractivity at visible wavelengths is historically traced and its small effect on the astronomical refraction angle numerically shown. Finally at infrared and radio wavelengths, the effects of the humidity in the lower atmosphere can be strong; as for the ionosphere, its curvature plays an essential role for the astronomical refraction angle unlike in the visible.</description>

      <title>Estimating Astrophysical Population Properties using a multi-component Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent start of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has reopened the hunt for gravitational-wave (GW) signals, with one compact-binary-coalescence (CBC) signal expected to be observed every few days. Among the signals that could be detected for the first time there is the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from the superposition of unresolvable GW signals that cannot be detected individually. In fact, multiple SGWBs are likely to arise given the variety of sources, making it crucial to identify the dominant components and assess their origin. However, most search methods with ground-based detectors assume the presence of one SGWB component at a time, which could lead to biased results in estimating its spectral shape if multiple SGWBs exist. Therefore, a joint estimate of the components is necessary. In this work, we adapt such an approach and analyse the data from the first three LVK observing runs, searching for a multi-component isotropic SGWB. We do not find evidence for any SGWB and establish upper limits on the dimensionless energy parameter $\Omega_{\rm gw}(f)$ at 25 Hz for five different power-law spectral indices, $\alpha = 0, \, 2/3,\, 2,\, 3,\, 4$, jointly. For the spectral indices $\alpha = 2/3,\, 2, \, 4$, corresponding to astrophysical SGWBs from CBCs, r-mode instabilities in young rotating neutron stars, and magnetars, we draw further astrophysical implications by constraining the ensemble parameters $K_{\rm CBC}, \, K_{\rm r-modes}, \, K_{\rm magnetars}$, defined in the main text.</description>

      <title>Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N : A $\mathcal{O}(N)$ software for N-body integration in collisional and fragmenting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is a $N$-body software developed for the time-efficient integration of collisional and fragmenting systems of planetesimals or moonlets orbiting a central mass. It features a fragmentation model, based on crater scaling and ejecta models, able to realistically simulate a violent impact. The user of Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N can choose between four different built-in modules to compute self-gravity and detect collisions. One of these makes use of a mesh-based algorithm to treat mutual interactions in $\mathcal{O}(N)$ time. Another module, much more efficient than the standard Barnes-Hut tree code, is a $\mathcal{O}(N)$ tree-based algorithm called FalcON. It relies on fast multipole expansion for gravity computation and we adapted it to collision detection as well. Computation time is reduced by building the tree structure using a three-dimensional Hilbert curve. For the same precision in mutual gravity computation, Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is found to be up to 25 times faster than the famous software REBOUND. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is written entirely in the C language and only needs a C compiler to run. A python add-on, that requires only basic python libraries, produces animations of the simulations from the output files. The name Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N, reminding of a scorpion, comes from the French $N$-corps, meaning $N$-body, and from the mathematical notation $\mathcal{O}(N)$, due to the running time of the software being almost linear in the total number $N$ of moonlets. Ncorpi$\mathcal{O}$N is designed for the study of accreting or fragmenting disks of planetesimal or moonlets. It detects collisions and computes mutual gravity faster than REBOUND, and unlike other $N$-body integrators, it can resolve a collision by fragmentation. The fast multipole expansions are implemented up to order six to allow for a high precision in mutual gravity computation.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of Little Red Dots and what is not, MIRI SMILES edition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study little red dots (LRD) detected by JADES and covered by the SMILES MIRI survey. Our sample contains 31 sources, $\sim70$% detected in the two bluest MIRI bands, 40% in redder filters. The median/quartiles redshifts are $z=6.9_{5.9}^{7.7}$ (55% spectroscopic). We analyze the rest-frame ultraviolet through near/mid-infrared spectral energy distributions of LRDs combining NIRCam and MIRI observations, using a variety of modeling techniques that include emission from stars, dust, and (un)obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). The NIRCam$-$MIRI colors, for $\geq10$ $\mu$m, are bluer than direct pure emission from AGN tori; the spectral slope flattens in the rest-frame near-infrared, consistent with a 1.6 $\mu$m stellar bump. Both observations imply that stellar emission makes the dominant contribution at these wavelengths, expediting a stellar mass estimation: the median/quartiles are $\log \mathrm{M_\star/M_\odot}=9.4_{9.1}^{9.7}$. The number density of LRDs is $10^{-4.0\pm0.1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, accounting for $14\pm3$% of the global population of galaxies with similar redshifts and masses. The flat ultraviolet spectral range is dominated by young stars. The rest-frame near/mid-infrared (2-4 $\mu$m) spectral slope reveals significant amounts of dust (bolometric stellar attenuation $\sim3-4$ mag) heated by strong radiation fields arising from highly embedded compact sources. Our models imply $&lt;0.4$ kpc heating knots, containing dust-enshrouded OB stars or an AGN producing a similar radiation field, obscured by $\mathrm{A(V)}&gt;10$ mag. We conclude that LRDs are extremely intense and compact starburst galaxies with mass-weighted ages 5-10 Myr, very efficient in producing dust, their global energy output dominated by the direct and dust-recycled emission from OB stars, with some contribution from obscured AGN in the mid-infrared.</description>
