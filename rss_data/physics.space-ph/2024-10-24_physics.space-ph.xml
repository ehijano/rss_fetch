      <title>Corotation-bounce resonance of ions in Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banded energy distributions of H$^{+}$, O$^{++}$, S$^{+++}$, and O$^+$ or S$^{++}$ ions between 100 eV to ~20 keV are consistently observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere mapping to M-shells between M=10-20. The bands correspond to flux enhancements at similar speeds for different ion species, providing the first evidence of simultaneous bounce-resonant acceleration of multiple ion species in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ion enhancements occur for energies at which the bounce frequencies of the trapped ions matched integer harmonics of the System-III corotation frequency. The observations highlight a previously unknown interaction between corotation and bounce motion of &lt;10 keV energy ions that is a fundamental and persistent process occurring in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Interaction of the Prominence Plasma within the Magnetic Cloud of an ICME with the Earth's Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic cloud within an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) is characterized by high magnetic field intensities. In this study, we investigate the interaction of a magnetic cloud carrying a density structure with the Earth's bow shock during the ICME event on 24 April 2023. Elevated abundances of cold protons and heavier ions, namely alpha particles and singly charged helium ions, associated with the prominence plasma are observed within this structure. The plasma downstream of the bow shock exhibits an irregular compression pattern which could be due to the presence of heavy ions. Heavy ions carry a significant fraction of the upstream flow energy; however, due to their different charge per mass ratio and rigidity, they are less scattered by the electromagnetic and electrostatic waves at the shock. We find that downstream of the shock, while the thermal ion energy is only a small fraction of the background magnetic energy density, nevertheless increased ion fluxes reduce the characteristic wave speeds in the that region. As such, we observe a transition state of an unstable bow shock layer across which the plasma flow is super Alfv\'enic in both upstream and downstream regions. Our findings help with understanding the intense space weather impacts of such events.</description>
