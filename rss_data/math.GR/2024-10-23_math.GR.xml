      <title>On group and loop spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of defining group or loop structures on spheres, where by ''sphere'' we mean the level set q(x) = c of a general K-valued quadratic form q, for an invertible scalar c. When K is a field and q non-degenerate, then this corresponds to the classical theory of composition algebras; in particular, for K = R and positive definite forms, we obtain the sequence of the four real division algebras R, C, H (quaternions), O (octonions). Our theory is more general, allowing that K is merely a ring, and the form q possibly degenerate. To achieve this goal, we give a more geometric formulation, replacing the theory of binary composition algebras by ternary algebraic structures, thus defining categories of group spherical and of Moufang spherical spaces. In particular, we develop a theory of ternary Moufang loops, and show how it is related to the Albert-Cayley-Dickson construction and to generalized ternary octonion algebras. At the bottom, a starting point of the whole theory is the (elementary) result that every 2-dimensional quadratic space carries a canonical structure of commutative group spherical space.</description>

      <title>Strongly sofic monoids, sofic topological entropy, and surjunctivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of strongly sofic monoids. This class of monoids strictly contains the class of sofic groups and is a proper subclass of the class of sofic monoids. We define and investigate sofic topological entropy for actions of strongly sofic monoids on compact spaces. We show that sofic topological entropy is a topological conjugacy invariant for such actions and use this fact to prove that every strongly sofic monoid is surjunctive. This means that if $M$ is a strongly sofic monoid and $A$ is a finite alphabet set, then every injective cellular automaton $\tau \colon A^M \to A^M$ is surjective. As an application, we prove that the monoid algebra of a strongly sofic monoid with coefficients in an arbitrary field is always stably finite. Our results are extensions to strongly sofic monoids of two previously known properties of sofic groups. The first one is the celebrated Gromov-Weiss theorem asserting that every sofic group is surjunctive. The second is the Elek-Szab\'o theorem which says that group algebras of sofic groups satisfy Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Free Products and the Isomorphism between Standard and Dual Artin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Coxeter system with a fixed Coxeter element, there is a surjective group morphism $\Psi$ from the standard to the dual Artin groups. We give conditions that are sufficient, necessary or equivalent to $\Psi$ being an isomorphism. In particular, we prove that if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of any element in the noncrossing partition poset is transitive, and if the Hurwitz action on the reduced words of the Coxeter element has the same stabilizer as essentially the same action viewed in the standard Artin group, then $\Psi$ is an isomorphism. Both of those conditions are already known in some cases, notably in spherical and affine types. We then prove that taking the free (or direct) product of groups that satisfy those two conditions yields another group that, with a suitable Coxeter element, also satisfies them.</description>

Abstract: We show that the group $\langle a,b,c,t : a^t=b,b^t=c,c^t=ca^{-1} \rangle$ is profinitely rigid amongst free-by-cyclic groups, providing the first example of a hyperbolic free-by-cyclic group with this property.</description>

      <title>Density of quotient orders in groups and applications to locally-transitive graphs</title>

Abstract: We prove that the set of orders of finite quotients of a finitely generated group has natural density 0, 1/2 or 1, and characterise when each of these cases occurs. We apply this to show that the sets of orders of various families of symmetric graphs have natural density 0.</description>

      <title>Exceptional groups of order $p^6$ for primes $p\geq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal faithful permutation degree $\mu(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the least integer $n$ such that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. If $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ such that $\mu(G/N) &gt; \mu(G)$, then $G$ is exceptional. We prove that the proportion of exceptional groups of order $p^6$ for primes $p \geq 5$ is asymptotically 0. We identify $(11p+107)/2$ such groups and conjecture that there are no others.</description>

      <title>The Adian-Rabin Theorem -- An English translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is an English translation of four remarkable articles, originally written in Russian, by Sergei Ivanovich Adian (1931--2020), supplemented by the translation of two closely related articles by Andrei Andreevich Markov Jr (1903--1979). All six articles concern algorithmic undecidability of various problems for groups and monoids. The articles by S. I. Adian give his proof of the famous "Adian-Rabin Theorem", which shows that there is no algorithm which takes as input a finite presentation of a group together with a "Markov" property $P$ (e.g. being the trivial group, being infinite, etc.), and which outputs whether or not the presented group has property $P$. The articles by A. A. Markov (Jr) give the analogous result for monoids (a significantly easier result), and appeared several years before the group-theoretic analogue. A preface detailing the contents of the articles and some commentary is provided, including the somewhat difficult task of deciding which of Adian's four articles should be considered as containing "the" proof of the Adian-Rabin theorem.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups I: Torus Knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative solution to a result by Juh\'{a}sz that the twisted conjugacy problem for odd dihedral Artin groups is solvable, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \; | \; _{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m\geq 3$ is odd, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab \dots$ of length $m$, is solvable. Our solution provides an implementable linear time algorithm, by considering an alternative group presentation to that of a torus knot group, and working with geodesic normal forms. An application of this result is that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of odd dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Latent symmetry of graphs and stretch factors in Out(Fr)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every irreducible outer automorphism of the free group of rank r is topologically represented by an irreducible train track map $f$ on some graph $\Gamma$ of rank r. Moreover, $f$ can always be written as a composition of folds and a graph isomorphism. We give a lower bound on the stretch factor of an irreducible outer automorphism in terms of the number of folds of $f$ and the number of edges in $\Gamma$. In the case that $f$ is periodic on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, we show a precise notion of the latent symmetry of $\Gamma$ gives a lower bound on the number of folds required. We use this notion of latent symmetry to classify all possible irreducible single fold train track maps.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>
