      <title>Demand, and consumer surplus in the payday-loan market: Evidence from British Columbia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how interest rate caps affect the demand for payday loans, using aggregate data from British Columbia (2012--2019) during which the province's maximum fee was reduced from \$23 to \$17 and then to \$15 per \$100 borrowed. Estimating a linear demand function via OLS, we find that lowering interest rate caps significantly increases loan demand. We estimate that the \$8 decrease, from \$23 to \$15 per \$100, raised annual consumer surplus by roughly \$28.6 million (2012 CAD). A further reduction to \$14, starting in January 2025, would add another \$3.9 million per year. These results suggest that stricter interest rate caps can yield substantial consumer welfare gains.</description>

      <title>AI and jobs. A review of theory, estimates, and evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is altering work processes, task composition, and organizational design, yet its effects on employment and the macroeconomy remain unresolved. In this review, we synthesize theory and empirical evidence at three levels. First, we trace the evolution from aggregate production frameworks to task- and expertise-based models. Second, we quantitatively review and compare (ex-ante) AI exposure measures of occupations from multiple studies and find convergence towards high-wage jobs. Third, we assemble ex-post evidence of AI's impact on employment from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), field experiments, and digital trace data (e.g., online labor platforms, software repositories), complemented by partial coverage of surveys. Across the reviewed studies, productivity gains are sizable but context-dependent: on the order of 20 to 60 percent in controlled RCTs, and 15 to 30 percent in field experiments. Novice workers tend to benefit more from LLMs in simple tasks. Across complex tasks, evidence is mixed on whether low or high-skilled workers benefit more. Digital trace data show substitution between humans and machines in writing and translation alongside rising demand for AI, with mild evidence of declining demand for novice workers. A more substantial decrease in demand for novice jobs across AI complementary work emerges from recent studies using surveys, platform payment records, or administrative data. Research gaps include the focus on simple tasks in experiments, the limited diversity of LLMs studied, and technology-centric AI exposure measures that overlook adoption dynamics and whether exposure translates into substitution, productivity gains, erode or increase expertise.</description>

      <title>A moderate share of V2G outperforms large-scale smart charging of electric vehicles and benefits other consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While battery electric vehicles (BEVs) play a key role for decarbonizing the transport sector, their impact on the power sector heavily depends on their charging strategies. Here we systematically analyze various combinations between inflexible, smart and bidirectional (or vehicle-to-grid, V2G) charging of 15 million electric cars in Germany. Using a capacity expansion model, we find that even a moderate share of bidirectional charging below 30% leads to lower system costs than a fully smartly charging BEV fleet. At a V2G share of 50%, costs are even lower than in a system without any BEVs. This means that the flexibility effect of half of the BEV fleet charging bidirectionally outweighs the demand effect of the whole BEV fleet. We show how costs savings are driven by the ability of V2G to serve demand, especially during hours with high residual load. We also explore the distributional effects of respective electricity price changes. While V2G car owners internalize a substantial share of overall cost savings, the benefits increasingly spill over to other electricity consumers as the share of bidirectional charging grows. We conclude that policymakers should focus on enabling a moderate fleet share of V2G rather than on enabling every car to charge smartly.</description>

      <title>Poverty and Perceptions of Electoral Integrity in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two opposing forces that impact the relation between electoral integrity and poverty. On the one hand, it is more costly to provide electoral integrity in states where there is more poverty due to transaction costs and opportunity costs. On the other hand, extreme levels of poverty attract media scrutiny and greater external monitoring of electoral integrity, giving rise to more demand for electoral integrity. Taken together, we expect electoral integrity to be a U-shaped function of poverty. We also hypothesize that electoral integrity will vary depending on the strength of state electoral laws. Expert-level survey data on electoral integrity from the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the 2018 U.S. congressional election, in combination with U.S. state-level data on poverty are strongly consistent with these predictions.</description>

      <title>The (Short-Term) Effects of Large Language Models on Unemployment and Earnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models have spread rapidly since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, accompanied by claims of major productivity gains but also concerns about job displacement. This paper examines the short-run labor market effects of LLM adoption by comparing earnings and unemployment across occupations with differing levels of exposure to these technologies. Using a Synthetic Difference in Differences approach, we estimate the impact of LLM exposure on earnings and unemployment. Our findings show that workers in highly exposed occupations experienced earnings increases following ChatGPT's introduction, while unemployment rates remained unchanged. These results suggest that initial labor market adjustments to LLMs operate primarily through earnings rather than worker reallocation.</description>

      <title>The Impact of AI Adoption on Retail Across Countries and Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on job loss rates using the Global AI Content Impact Dataset (2020--2025). The panel comprises 200 industry-country-year observations across Australia, China, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom in ten industries. A three-stage ordinary least squares (OLS) framework is applied. First, a full-sample regression finds no significant linear association between AI adoption rate and job loss rate ($\beta \approx -0.0026$, $p = 0.949$). Second, industry-specific regressions identify the marketing and retail sectors as closest to significance. Third, interaction-term models quantify marginal effects in those two sectors, revealing a significant retail interaction effect ($-0.138$, $p &lt; 0.05$), showing that higher AI adoption is linked to lower job loss in retail. These findings extend empirical evidence on AI's labor market impact, emphasize AI's productivity-enhancing role in retail, and support targeted policy measures such as intelligent replenishment systems and cashierless checkout implementations.</description>

      <title>Battling the Coronavirus Infodemic Among Social Media Users in Kenya and Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13638v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we induce social media users to be discerning when sharing information during a pandemic? An experiment on Facebook Messenger with users from Kenya (n = 7,498) and Nigeria (n = 7,794) tested interventions designed to decrease intentions to share COVID-19 misinformation without decreasing intentions to share factual posts. The initial stage of the study incorporated: (i) a factorial design with 40 intervention combinations; and (ii) a contextual adaptive design, increasing the probability of assignment to treatments that worked better for previous subjects with similar characteristics. The second stage evaluated the best-performing treatments and a targeted treatment assignment policy estimated from the data. We precisely estimate null effects from warning flags and related article suggestions, tactics used by social media platforms. However, nudges to consider information's accuracy reduced misinformation sharing relative to control by 4.9% (estimate = -2.3 pp, s.e. = 1.0 , Z = -2.31, p = 0.021, 95% CI = [-4.2 , -0.35]). Such low-cost scalable interventions may improve the quality of information circulating online.</description>

      <title>How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an 8-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive -- present only in blocks from a single builder -- or private -- absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that exclusive transactions account for 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Furthermore, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully explained by exclusive relationships between senders and builders: about 7% of all exclusive transactions included on-chain, by value, come from senders who route exclusively to a single builder. Analyzing transaction logs shows that some exclusive transactions are duplicates or variations of the same strategy, but even accounting for that, the share of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks is at least 77.2%. Taken together, our findings highlight that exclusive transactions are the dominant source of builder revenues.</description>

      <title>How General Are Measures of Choice Consistency? Evidence from Experimental and Scanner Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Choice consistency with utility maximization, as a key assumption in economics, has been extensively used to evaluate decision quality of individuals and to predict real-world outcomes across different contexts. Here we investigate the generalizability of consistency measures derived from budgetary decisions in the lab-in-the-field experiment and purchasing decisions using supermarket scanner data. In the first study, we observe a lack of correlation between consistency scores derived from risky decisions in the experiment and those from supermarket food purchasing decisions. In the second study, we observe moderate correlations between experimental tasks and low to moderate correlations across purchasing categories and over time periods within the supermarket. Moreover, consistency in the two settings exhibits distinct predictive validity in predicting consumer behavior. These results suggest that choice consistency, as a measure of decision quality, may be better characterized as a multidimensional skill set rather than a single-dimensional ability.</description>

      <title>Getting Explicit Instruction Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been substantial public debate about the potentially deleterious effects of the long-run move to ``inquiry-based learning'' in which students are placed at the center of an educational journey and arrive at their own understanding of what is being taught. There have been numerous calls for a return to ``direct'' or ``explicit'' instruction. This paper focuses on identifying the causal effect of correctly implementing explicit instruction on student performance in standardized tests. We utilise a unique setting in Australia\textemdash a country in which all students in grades 3, 5, 7, and 9 undergo annual basic skills tests (``NAPLAN''). We use a synthetic control approach to study the effect of introducing Explicit Instruction in Charlestown South Public School\textemdash a median-performing school\textemdash on Year-3 and Year-5 NAPLAN scores in Reading and Numeracy. Importantly, this is achieved via peer modelling, with Charlestown teaching staff sitting-in during the classes of a high-performing explicit-instruction school. We find that the performance gains are substantial and persistent. JEL: I20, I21. Keywords: Education, Explicit Instruction, Pedagogy.</description>
