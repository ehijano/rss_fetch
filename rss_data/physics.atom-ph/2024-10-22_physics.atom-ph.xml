      <title>Long spin-1/2 noble gas coherence times in mm-sized anodically bonded batch-fabricated $^{3}$He-$^{129}$Xe-$^{87}$Rb cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the only stable spin-1/2 noble gas isotopes, $^{3}$He and $^{129}$Xe are promising systems for inertial rotation sensing and searches for exotic spin couplings. Spin-1/2 noble gases have intrinsic coherence times on the order of hours to days, which allows for incredibly low frequency error of free-precession measurements. However relaxation in miniature cells is dominated by interactions with the cell wall, which limits the performance of a chip-scale sensor that uses noble gases. While $^{129}$Xe wall relaxation times have previously been limited to 10's of seconds in mm-sized cells, we demonstrate the first anodically bonded batch-fabricated cells with dual $^{3}$He-$^{129}$Xe isotopes and $^{87}$Rb in a 6~mm$^3$ volume with $^{3}$He and $^{129}$Xe $T_2$ coherence times of, respectively, 4 h and 300 s. We use these microfabricated cells in a dual noble-gas comagnetometer and discuss its limits.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure and dynamics of the actinides from U through Lr using Regge-pole analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of the actinide atoms from U to Lr is probed through the electron elastic scattering total cross sections (TCSs) calculated using Regge pole analysis. The crucial Regge trajectories probe electron attachment at the fundamental level near threshold leading to stable ground, metastable and excited negative-ion formation as resonances as well as Ramsauer-Townsend (R-T) minima and shape resonances (SRs). A polarization-induced metastable TCS with a deep R-T minimum near threshold first appears in the Pu TCSs, marking the first break in periodicity in the actinides while in the Cf TCSs the R-T minimum manifests as a SR very close to threshold, demonstrating the second break. These results are consistent with observations. Moreover, the highest excited states TCSs of U and Pu exhibit the strongest fullerene molecular behavior among the actinides, implying their multi-functionalization, including nanocatalysis through their doubly-charged anions. Electron affinities are also extracted from the TCSs.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Stability of a Two-Color, Two-Photon Rubidium Frequency Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubidium two-photon frequency standards are emerging as powerful contenders for compact, durable devices with exceptional stability. The field has focused on single-color excitation to date. Here we demonstrate the key advantages of a two-color excitation of a two-photon optical frequency standard based on the $5S_{1/2}\,{\rightarrow}\,5D_{5/2}$ transition of rubidium-87 utilising driving fields at 780 nm and 776 nm. We show that utilising the $5P_{3/2}$ intermediate state to resonantly enhance the transition, we can for the first time attain frequency stabilities comparable to the rubidium single-color two-photon frequency standards, notably with approximately ten-fold less optical power and ten-fold lower rubidium vapor density. Optimisation of the detuning from the $5P_{3/2}$ intermediate state, and optical powers of driving lasers, has a dramatic effect on the frequency stability, achieving the best short-term stability of any two-photon rubidium frequency standard to date, of $6{\times}10^{-14}$ at $\tau$ = 1 s. We demonstrate this level of performance is compatible with a compact geometry, by fully self-referencing the frequency standard using an integrated fiber frequency comb to simultaneously stabilize the 780 nm laser's detuning from the $5P_{3/2}$ intermediate state, and produce a frequency-stable microwave output. A comprehensive noise characterization underpins our observations of this two-color frequency standard which explains the measured stability, showing this frequency standard is shot-noise limited initially before becoming limited by light shifts in the long-term. This work represents a major advance towards a low size, weight, and power frequency standard based on this two-color excitation method.</description>

      <title>Resonant photoionization and time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances leave prominent signatures in atomic and molecular ionization triggered by the absorption of single or multiple photons. These signatures reveal various aspects of the ionization process, characterizing both the initial and final states of the target. Resonant spectral features are typically associated with sharp variations in the photoionization phase, providing an opportunity for laser-assisted interferometric techniques to measure this phase and convert it into a photoemission time delay. This time delay offers a precise characterization of the timing of the photoemission process.
  In this review, a unified approach to resonant photoionization is presented by examining the analytic properties of ionization amplitude in the complex photoelectron energy plane. This approach establishes a connection between the resonant photoemission time delay and the corresponding photoionization cross-section. Numerical illustrations of this method include: (i) giant or shape resonances, where the photoelectron is spatially confined within a potential barrier, (ii) Fano resonances, where bound states are embedded in the continuum, (iii) Cooper minima (anti-resonances) arising from kinematic nodes in the dipole transition matrix elements, and (iv) confinement resonances in atoms encapsulated within a fullerene cage.
  The second part of this review focuses on two-photon resonant ionization processes, where the photon energies can be tuned to a resonance in either the intermediate or final state of the atomic target. Our examples include one- or two-electron discrete excitations both below and above the ionization threshold. These resonant states are probed using laser-assisted interferometric techniques. Additionally, we employ laser-assisted photoemission to measure the lifetimes of several atomic autoionizing states.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus semi-classical signatures of correlated triple ionization in Dalitz plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate correlated three-electron escape in Ne when driven by an intense, infrared laser field. We do so by employing a reduced-dimensionality quantum-mechanical model and two three-dimensional semi-classical models. One semi-classical model is a recently developed one that accounts with effective coulomb potentials for the interaction between two bound electrons (ECBB) while it fully accounts for all other interactions. The other semi-classical model is the Heisenberg one, which effectively accounts for the interaction of each electron with the core via a soft-core potential. We identify and compare the signatures of correlated three-electron escape for both quantum and semi-classical models on Dalitz plots and find a better agreement between the quantum and the ECBB model. We also show that a central ``spot'' on the Dalitz plots is reproduced by all models. Using the ECBB model we associate this ``spot'' with the direct triple ionization pathway and argue this to be the case also for the quantum model. Devising a simple classical model that accounts for the direct pathway of triple ionization, we show that the width of this spot in the Dalitz plots solely depends on the time of tunnel-ionization.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LXV. Mid-Infrared rovibronic spectroscopy of isotopologues of NiH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New line lists for four isotopologues of nickel monohydride, $^{58}$NiH, $^{60}$NiH, $^{62}$NiH, and $^{58}$NiD are presented covering the wavenumber range $&lt;10000$ cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda &gt; 1$ $\mu$m), $J$ up to 37.5 for transitions within and between the three lowest-lying electronic states, ${X}\,^{2}\Delta$, ${W}\,^{2}\Pi$, and ${V}\,^{2}\Sigma^{+}$. The line lists are applicable for temperatures up to 5000 K. The line lists calculations are based on a recent empirical NiH spectroscopic model [Havalyova et al. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf., 272, 107800, (2021)] which is adapted for the variational nuclear-motion code Duo. The model consists of potential energy curves, spin-orbit coupling curves, electronic angular momentum curves, spin-rotation coupling curves, $\Lambda$-doubling correction curve for $^2\Pi$ states and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) rotational correction curves. New ab initio dipole moment curves, scaled to match the experimental dipole moment of the ground state, are used to compute Einstein A coefficients. The BYOT line lists are included in the ExoMol database at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar but can be factors for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The calculation is also compared with the cases of Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.</description>

      <title>Ionization potential of radium monofluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.969(2)[10] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.969[7] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{0}$) of 5.54[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{0}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Feedback-Induced Nonlinear Spin Dynamics in an Inhomogeneous Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects are the root of interesting phenomena such as masers and lasers, and play a significant role in science and engineering. In spin systems, nonlinear spin dynamics is crucial for the prediction of complex dynamical behavior such as self-organizing oscillation, with applications ranging from spin masers and time crystals to precision measurement. However, when a spin system operates in a static magnetic field, how the inhomogeneity of the field affects its dynamics is a primary concern. Here we study the dynamics of a collection of spins with multiple Larmor frequencies for modeling a static inhomogeneous magnetic field, and reveal that due to the nonlinearity induced by a feedback scheme, the spin system exhibits much richer stable dynamical phases, including quasi-periodic orbits and chaos besides the usual limit cycles emerged in previous works. These phases are generally applicable to coupled nonlinear spin systems, even with more than two intrinsic Larmor frequencies or in continuum cases. Furthermore, we discuss their robustness against the experimental noises and the feasibility of realization in several spin systems. Our findings contribute to future observation of nonlinear dynamical phases and prospective applications in precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of orientation averages and its application to molecular physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In molecular physics, it is often necessary to average over the orientation of molecules when calculating observables, in particular when modelling experiments in the liquid or gas phase. Evaluated in terms of Euler angles, this is closely related to integration over two- or three-dimensional unit spheres, a common problem discussed in numerical analysis. The computational cost of the integration depends significantly on the quadrature method, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial for the feasibility of simulations. After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in terms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for choosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate these with three examples from chiral molecule physics. While Gauss quadratures allow for achieving numerically exact integration for a wide range of applications, other methods offer advantages in specific circumstances. Our guidelines can also by applied to higher-dimensional spherical domains and other geometries. We also present a Python package providing a flexible interface to a variety of quadrature methods.</description>
