      <title>Electrostatics and viscosity are strongly linked in concentrated antibody solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains explicitly, also including counterions and salt ions, and to properly account for the long-ranged nature of Coulomb interactions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of chromatic patchy particles with tetrahedrally arranged patches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The achievement of selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond is challenging due to the emergence of competing phases such as its hexagonal polymorph or clathrates possessing similar free energy. Although both polymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it at lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a promising candidate for photonic applications.Herein, we demonstrate that the 1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic diamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are manifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We provide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement, resembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the selectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the similarities to the antiferromagnetic systems. We always observe the mixture of both hexagonal and cubic diamonds, however, the formation of such stacking hybrids is observed for a wider range of patch sizes compared to the one-component system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Molecular Weight Dependence Reveals the Origin of Mechanical Enhancement in Polymer Nanocomposite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers at the interface exhibit frustrated chain conformation distinct from the bulk, impacting particle dispersion and properties of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Utilizing bimodal molecular weight (MW) PNCs, we observed unusual chain elongation of interfacial polymers, which promotes networked structures at low particle loadings. Paradoxically, reducing the average MW in bimodal PNCs significantly enhances the shear modulus by up to 103 times, challenging the conventional preference for higher MW in property enhancement. The mechanical reinforcement, aided by stretched chains, manifests when the short chain is substantially shorter than the long chain (Rg ratio &gt;~2), indicating a universal stretching factor of 2.3.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding structure-function relationships in random fiber networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random fiber networks form the structural foundation of numerous biological tissues and engineered materials, from living tissue in the human body to everyday materials like fabric and paper. From a mechanics perspective, understanding the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks is particularly interesting because when external force is applied to these networks, only a small subset of fibers will actually carry the majority of the load. Specifically, these load-bearing fibers propagate through the network to form load paths, also called force chains. However, the relationship between fiber network geometric structure, force chains, and the overall mechanical behavior of random fiber network structures remains poorly understood. To this end, we implement a finite element model of random fiber networks with geometrically exact beam elements, and use this model to explore random fiber network mechanical behavior. Our focus is twofold. First, we explore the mechanical behavior of single fiber chains and random fiber networks. Second, we propose and validate an interpretable analytical approach to predicting fiber network mechanics from structural information alone. Key findings include insight into the critical strain-stiffening transition point for single fiber chains and fiber networks, and a connection between force chains and the distance-weighted graph shortest paths that arise by treating fiber networks as spatial graph structures. This work marks an important step towards mapping the structure-function relationships of random fiber networks undergoing large deformations. Additionally, with our code distributed under open-source licenses, we hope that future researchers can directly build on our work to address related problems beyond the scope defined here.</description>

      <title>On the origin of heating-induced stiffening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that this instead arises from a bulk-modulus mediated competition between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks over preferred nonequilibrium densities under deformation. A theory accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating quantitatively predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.</description>

      <title>Species interconversion of deformable particles yields transient phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to a landscape that defines three species: particles with finite size, either of type $A$ or of type $B$, and point particles $\varnothing$. We show that the nonequilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</description>

      <title>Review and analysis of thermophysical properties of a sulfuric acid-water electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have performed a critical review of the thermophysical properties of sulfuric acid-water mixtures. The thermophysical properties analyzed are density, viscosity, refraction index, thermal expansion coefficient, and mass expansion coefficient. The density of the sulfuric acid-water mixture has been measured for different mass fractions, w = 0.1-0.4, over a broad temperatura range, T = 273.15-333.15 K. A new parametrization of the density has been performed using a least-squares method. In this parametrization, the number of coefficients has been reduced with respect to previous works. Moreover, this new equation has been analyzed in an extended region of temperature and concentration in the following ranges: w = 0-0.1 and T = 233.15-373.15 K. The coefficients of thermal and mass expansion have also been calculated experimentally, and a linear relation of the density has been determined as a function of the variations in temperature and concentration. In addition, viscosity and refraction index measurements have been performed at 298.15 and 293.15 K, respectively. Our results have been checked against measurements in the literature (review) and show good correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We coarse-grain a model of closely-packed ellipses that can vary their aspect ratio to derive continuum equations for materials comprising confluent deformable particles such as epithelial cell layers. We show that contractile nearest neighbour interactions between ellipses can lead to their elongation and nematic ordering. Adding flows resulting from active hydrodynamic stresses produced by the particles also affects the aspect ratio and can result in active turbulence. Our results, which agree well with multi-phase field simulations of deformable isotropic cells, provide a bridge between models which explicitly resolve cells and continuum theories of active matter.</description>

      <title>Capillary Pressure-Saturation relation derived from the Pore Morphology Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A computationally efficient method to calculate the capillary pressure-saturation relations of immiscible multiphase flow on two-dimensional pore morphologies is presented here. The method is an extension of the Pore Morphology Method that includes wetting angle and trapped mechanism of the displaced fluid, and calculation of material properties by density functional theory. After validating the method with micro-chip fluid injection experiments, the method is used to relate pore morphology to capillary pressure-saturation relation using square-lattice pore morphologies. Because the method uses only morphological binary operations, it is more efficient than well-established high-resolution voxel dynamics methods such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods and Level-set computational fluid dynamics. Apart from pore morphology, only the material parameters related to contact angle (wettability) and interfacial tension are required to connect the pore-saturation relation and pore throat distribution. We investigate the effect on interfacial tension, wettability, sample size, and pore throat distribution on entry pressure and residual saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of spindle-like cells as nematic liquid crystals has led to remarkable insights in the understanding of tissue organization and morphogenesis. In the characterization of this anomalous liquid crystal material, we focus on the energetic cost of splay and bend deformations, in order to determine the elastic anisotropy of the material, i.e. the ratio of the elastic constants associated with splay and bend. We explore the behavior of monolayers of cells in proximity to corners, where cells arrange in splay or bend configuration, strongly dependent on the amplitude of the wedge angle. The angle at which splay and bend deformations are equally likely is determined by the ratio between splay and bend elastic constants. We also show that the splay and bend deformations under confinement can be well approximated using equilibrium liquid crystal theory and statistical mechanics. Finally, our data suggest that for fibroblast cells the common approximation of equal bend and splay constant is valid.</description>

      <title>Kinesin-driven de-mixing of cytoskeleton composites drives emergent mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cytoskeleton is an active composite of filamentous proteins that dictates diverse mechanical properties and processes in eukaryotic cells by generating forces and autonomously restructuring itself. Enzymatic motors that act on the comprising filaments play key roles in this activity, driving spatiotemporally heterogeneous mechanical responses that are critical to cellular multifunctionality, but also render mechanical characterization challenging. Here, we couple optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy with simulations and mathematical modeling to robustly characterize the mechanics of active composites of actin filaments and microtubules restructured by kinesin motors. We discover that composites exhibit a rich ensemble of force response behaviors, elastic, yielding, and stiffening, with their propensity and properties tuned by motor concentration and strain rate. Moreover, intermediate kinesin concentrations elicit emergent mechanical stiffness and resistance while higher and lower concentrations exhibit softer, more viscous dissipation. We further show that composites transition from well-mixed interpenetrating double-networks of actin and microtubules to de-mixed states of microtubule-rich aggregates surrounded by relatively undisturbed actin phases. It is this de-mixing that leads to the emergent mechanical response, offering an alternate route that composites can leverage to achieve enhanced stiffness through coupling of structure and mechanics.</description>

      <title>The shape of cleaved tethered membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A remarkable property of flexible self-avoiding elastic surfaces (membranes) is that they remain flat at all temperatures, even in the absence of a bending rigidity or in the presence of active fluctuations. Here, we report numerical results of these surfaces wherein we alter their topology by systematically cleaving internal bonds. While it is known that a random removal of membrane bonds does not disrupt the overall extended shape of the membrane, we find that cleaving an elastic surface with longitudinal parallel cuts leads to its systematic collapse into a number of complex morphologies that can be controlled by altering the number and length of the inserted cuts. For the simpler case of membranes with bending rigidity but in the absence of self-avoidance, we find that the radius of gyration of the surface as a function of number of cuts is represented by a universal master curve when the variables are appropriately rescaled.</description>

      <title>From Fiber to Fabric: Designing the Mechanics of Machine Knitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knit fabrics are mechanically durable and tough while sufficiently flexible to conform to curved substrates such as the human body. Recent advancements in industrial knitting enable unprecedented control over the pattern design and functionality of next generation knit fabrics. However, the ability to leverage this granular control to predict and tune the mechanical behavior of these fabrics remains limited due to their complex hierarchical and entangled microstructure. This study establishes a comprehensive experimental and numerical framework to characterize and model the mechanical properties of industrial knitted fabrics. By integrating precise experiments, finite element modeling, and a strain energy-based homogenization approach, we provide an accurate demonstration of how stitch length, pattern, and yarn material govern the anisotropic mechanical response of knitted fabrics. In doing so, we establish clear quantitative links between these parameters and key material properties, including stiffness and anisotropy, that emerge directly from our energy-based model. Recognizing that industrial knitting systems can produce fabrics with spatially varying parameters, we extend our framework to predict heterogeneous knits. We show that material transitions have minimal impact on the fabric's overall mechanical response, so heterogeneous fabrics can be modeled with our framework as patchworks of homogeneous samples. We design the first industrially knit sleeve explicitly optimized for both fit and function, using heterogeneous patterns that conform to target arm musculature and ensure uniform stress distribution. This work bridges the gap between computational modeling and scalable manufacturing, unlocking new possibilities for wearable devices, assistive textiles, and functional applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform states of matter exhibit unusual suppression of density fluctuations at large scales, contrasting sharply with typical disordered configurations. Various types of hyperuniformity emerge in multicomponent disordered systems, significantly enhancing their functional properties for advanced applications. This paper focuses on developing a theoretical framework for two-component hyperuniform systems. We provide a robust theoretical basis to identify novel conditions on structure factors for a variety of hyperuniform binary mixtures, classifying them into five distinct types with seven unique states. Our findings also offer valuable guidelines for designing multihyperuniform materials where each component preserves hyperuniformity, added to the overall hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Simulating spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates: a concise overview for non-experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold ensembles of bosons are a useful platform for studying many-body quantum states present in quantum technologies, and simulations of these systems are convenient for streamlining design of such technologies. This paper provides an overview of spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), along with an overview of simulation methods and a case study on a novel "microemulsion" phase. These SOC-BECs are further described in the context of coherent states quantum field theory, utilizing the complex Langevin sampling scheme as a numerical algorithm. This approach for studying SOC BECs is a versatile and powerful alternative to particle-based methods and has promise for simulating other bosonic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Competing Effects of Local Solvation Structures on Chemical Shift Changes of Liquid Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of self-folding 3D shells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-folding is an emerging paradigm for the inverse design of three-dimensional structures. While most efforts have concentrated on the shape of the net, our approach introduces a new design dimension-bond specificity between the edges. We transform this design process into a Boolean Satisfiability problem to derive solutions for various target structures. This method significantly enhances the yield of the folding process. Furthermore, by linearly combining independent solutions, we achieve designs for shape-shifting nets wherein the dominant structure evolves with varying external conditions. This approach is demonstrated through coarse-grained simulations on two examples of triangular and square nets capable of folding into multiple target shapes.</description>

Abstract: Prions are misfolded proteins that transmit their structural arrangement to neighboring proteins. In biological systems, prion dynamics can produce a variety of complex functional outcomes. Yet, an understanding of prionic causes has been hampered by the fact that few computational models exist that allow for experimental design, hypothesis testing, and control. Here, we identify essential prionic properties and present a biologically inspired model of prions using simple mechanical structures capable of undergoing complex conformational change. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by designing a prototypical mechanical prion and validating its properties experimentally. Our work provides a design framework for harnessing and manipulating prionic properties in natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent polar order in non-polar mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomenological rules that govern the collective behaviour of complex physical systems are powerful tools because they can make concrete predictions about their universality class based on generic considerations, such as symmetries, conservation laws, and dimensionality. While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behaviour of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with non-reciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner-Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory -- which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms -- belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar non-reciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

      <title>Swelling and evaporation determine surface morphology of grafted hydrogel thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally study the formation of surface patterns in grafted hydrogel films of nanometer-to-micrometer thicknesses during imbibition-driven swelling followed by evaporation-driven shrinking. Creases are known to form at the hydrogel surface during swelling; the wavelength of the creasing pattern is proportional to the initial thickness of the hydrogel film with a logarithmic correction that depends on microscopic properties of the hydrogel. We find that, although the characteristic wavelength of the pattern is determined during swelling, the surface morphology can be significantly influenced by evaporation-induced shrinking. We observe that the elastocapillary length based on swollen mechanical properties gives a threshold thickness for a surface pattern formation, and consequently an important change in morphology.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal pattern formation of membranes induced by surface molecular binding/unbinding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium membrane pattern formation is studied using meshless membrane simulation. We consider that molecules bind to either surface of a bilayer membrane and move to the opposite leaflet by flip--flop. When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating hydrodynamics of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing: static and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we derive and test the fluctuating hydrodynamic description of active particles interacting via taxis and quorum sensing, both for mono-disperse systems and for mixtures of co-existing species of active particles. We compute the average steady-state density profile in the presence of spatial motility regulation, as well as the structure factor and intermediate scattering function for interacting systems. By comparing our predictions to microscopic numerical simulations, we show that our fluctuating hydrodynamics correctly predicts the large-scale static and dynamical properties of the system. We also discuss how the theory breaks down when structures emerge at scales smaller or comparable to the persistence length of the particles. When the density field is the unique hydrodynamic mode of the system, we show that active Brownian particles, run-and-tumble particles and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles, interacting via quorum-sensing or chemotactic interactions, display undistinguishable large-scale properties. This form of universality implies an interesting robustness of the predicted physics but also that large-scale observations of patterns are insufficient to assess their microscopic origins. In particular, our results predict that chemotaxis-induced and motility-induced phase separation should share strong qualitative similarities at the macroscopic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing a two-species Cahn-Hilliard model with nonreciprocal interactions we show that the interplay of nonreciprocity and conservation laws results in the robust coexistence of uniform stationary and oscillatory phases as well as of uniform and crystalline phases. For nonequilibrium models with a spurious gradient dynamics structure such coexistencies between two or more nonequilibrium phases and resulting phase diagrams can nevertheless be predicted by a Maxwell double-tangent construction. This includes phases with sustained regular or irregular out-of-equilibrium dynamics as further corroborated by bifurcation studies and time simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of capillary waves in miscible co-flowing fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that capillary waves can exist at the the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a frequency independent wavenumber, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to a capillary wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$, unexpected for miscible fluids. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square-gradient theories. Our work potentially opens a new avenue to measure transient interfacial tensions at the millisecond scale in a controlled manner.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Face-Dependent Ice Growth Kinetics: Insights from Molecular Dynamics on the Basal and Prism Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of a Water Droplet on a Horizontally Vibrating Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deformed droplets are ubiquitous in various industrial applications, such as inkjet printing, lab-on-a-chip devices, and spray cooling, and can fundamentally affect the involved applications both favorably and unfavorably. Here, we employ many-body dissipative particle dynamics to investigate the oscillations of water droplets on a harmonically and horizontally vibrating, solid substrate. Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the substrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common situation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other two scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet oscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup. Leveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the mechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level resolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our study suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the contact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities influenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the particle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the three oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the oscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to optimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have direct implications for technological applications.</description>
