      <title>Conformal dimension bounds, Pontryagin sphere boundaries, and algebraic fibering of right-angled Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a graph-theoretic condition, called $(n,m)$--branching, that ensures a combinatorial round tree with controlled branching parameters can be quasi-isometrically embedded in the Davis complex of the right-angled Coxeter group defined by the graph. This construction yields a lower bound on the conformal dimension of the boundary of such a hyperbolic group. We exhibit numerous families of graphs with this property, including many 1-dimensional spherical buildings.
  We prove an embedding result, showing that under mild hypotheses a flag-no-square graph embeds as an induced subgraph in a flag-no-square triangulation of a closed surface. We use this to embed our branching graphs into graphs presenting hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter groups with Pontryagin sphere boundary. We conclude there are examples of such groups with conformal dimension tending to infinity, and hence, there are infinitely many quasi-isometry classes within this family.
  We use conformal dimension to show that recent work of Lafont--Minemyer--Sorcar--Stover--Wells can be upgraded to conclude that for every $n \geq 2$ there exist infinitely many quasi-isometry classes of hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter groups that virtually algebraically fiber and have virtual cohomological dimension $n$.</description>

      <title>Coprime commutators in profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a coprime commutator in a profinite group $G$ we mean any element of the form $[x, y]$, where $x,y\in G$ and $(|x|,|y|)=1$. It is well-known that the subgroup generated by the coprime commutators of $G$ is precisely the pronilpotent residual $\gamma_\infty(G)$. There are several recent works showing that finiteness conditions on the set of coprime commutators have strong impact on the properties of $\gamma_\infty(G)$ and, more generally, on the structure of $G$. In this paper we show that if the set of coprime commutators of a profinite group $G$ is covered by countably many procyclic subgroups, then $\gamma_\infty(G)$ is finite-by-procyclic. In particular, it follows that $G$ is finite-by-pronilpotent-by-abelian.</description>

      <title>HNN extensions of free groups with equal associated subgroups of finite index: polynomial time word problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=F\ast_\varphi t$ be an HNN extension of a free group $F$ with two equal associated normal subgroups $H_1 = H_2$ of finite index. We prove that the word problem in $G$ is decidable in polynomial time. This result extends to the case where the subgroups $H_1=H_2$ are not normal, provided that the isomorphism $\varphi:H_1\to H_2$ satisfies an additional condition described in Section 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanishing-off subgroups, generalized Camina pair and other related subgroups have played a significant role in the study of group structure. The primary goal of this paper is to study their analogs in the setting of supercharacter theory. We establish several properties of these subgroups which includes connections with supercharacter theory products.</description>

      <title>Characteristic Subgroup Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s_n^\mathrm{ch}(\Gamma)$ denote the number of characteristic subgroups of index at most $n$ in a finitely generated group $\Gamma$. In response to a question of I. Rivin we show that if $\Gamma = F_r$ is the free group on $r \geq 2$ generators then the growth type of $s_n^{\mathrm{ch}}(F_r)$ is $n^{\mathrm{log}(n)}$. This is in contrast with the expectation of W. Thurston who predicted that there should be a difference between $r = 2$ and $r &gt; 2$. Along the way we answer a question of arXiv:1703.07866 on the normal subgroup growth of large groups.</description>

      <title>Schur multiplier of $\mathrm{SL}_2$ over finite commutative rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the Schur multiplier of the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_2(A)$ over finite commutative local rings $A$. We prove that the Schur multiplier of these groups is isomorphic to the $K$-group $K_2(A)$ whenever the residue field $A/\mathfrak{m}_A$ has odd characteristic and satisfies $|A/\mathfrak{m}_A| \neq 3,5,9$. As an application, we show that if $A$ is either the Galois ring $\mathrm{GR}(p^l,m)$ or the quasi-Galois ring $A(p^m,n)$ with residue field of odd characteristic and $|A/\mathfrak{m}_A| \neq 3,5,9$, then the Schur multiplier of $\mathrm{SL}_2(A)$ is trivial.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a finite sequence of graphs, beginning with the curve graph and ending with a graph quasi-isometric to a tree. There is a Lipschitz map from one graph in the sequence to the next. This sequence was first introduced by Hamenst\"adt. We prove (as conjectured by Hamenst\"adt) that the graphs in this sequence are hyperbolic and that the coarse fibers of the maps in the sequence are quasi-trees. This gives an upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of each graph in the sequence and as a result, an upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of the curve graph. Additionally, we show that the action of the mapping class group on each graph in the sequence is acylindrical, and classify the boundary and actions of individual mapping classes for each graph in the sequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the singular twin monoid and its corresponding group, constructed from both algebraic and topological perspectives. We then classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local and $3$-local representations of this constructed group. Moreover, we study the irreducibility of these representations and provide clear conditions under which irreducibility holds. Our results give a structured approach to understanding this new algebraic object and its representations.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap for the signed interchange process with arbitrary sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2020, F.Cesi introduced a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group $B_n$ and analysed its spectral gap when the allowed generators are transpositions and diagonal elements corresponding to singletons. In this paper we extend the allowed generators to transpositions and any diagonal elements, and characterise completely the set of representations from which the spectral gap arises. This settles a conjecture posed in Cesi's paper.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Cannon-Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a closed fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold M, the inclusion of a fiber S, with S and M lifted to the universal covers gives an exponentially distorted embedding of the hyperbolic plane into hyperbolic 3-space. Nevertheless, Cannon and Thurston showed that there is a map from the circle at infinity of the hyperbolic plane to the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space. The Cannon-Thurston map is surjective, finite-to-one, and gives a space-filling curve. Here we prove that many natural measures on the circle when pushed forward by the Cannon-Thurston map become singular with respect to many natural measures on the 2-sphere. The circle measures we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from fully supported random walks on the surface group. Whereas the measures on the sphere we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from geometric random walks on the 3-manifold group. The singularity of measures is ultimately derived from the following geometric result. We prove that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a pushforward measure asymptotically spends a definite proportion of its time close to a fiber. On the other hand, we show that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a natural measure on the sphere spends an asymptotically negligible proportion of its time close to a fiber. For a more restricted class of measures, namely the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures from geometric random walks on the surface group, we also prove an effective result for the proportion of time spent close to a fiber. To this end, we give precise descriptions if quasi-geodesics in the Cannon-Thurston metric, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Kronecker Coefficients and Simultaneous Conjugacy Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kronecker coefficient is the multiplicity of an irreducible representation of a finite group $G$ in a tensor product of irreducible representations. We define Kronecker Hecke algebras and use them as a tool to study Kronecker coefficients in finite groups. We show that the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes in a finite group $G$ is equal to the sum of squares of Kronecker coefficients, and the number of simultaneous conjugacy classes that are closed under elementwise inversion is the sum of Kronecker coefficients weighted by Frobenius-Schur indicators. We use these tools to investigate which finite groups have multiplicity-free tensor products. We introduce the class of doubly real groups, and show that they are precisely the real groups which have multiplicity-free tensor products. We show that non-Abelian groups of odd order, non-Abelian finite simple groups, and most finite general linear groups do not have multiplicity-free tensor products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the research from the paper "Triangles, squares and geodesics" (arXiv:0910.5688) of Rena Levitt and Jon McCammond we investigate the properties of groups acting on CAT(0) triangle-square complexes, focusing mostly on biautomaticity of such groups. In particular we show two examples of nonpositively curved triangle-square complexes $X_1$ and $X_2$, such that their universal covers violate conjectures given in the aforementioned paper. This shows that the Gersten-Short geodesics cannot be used as a way of proving biautomaticity of groups acting on such complexes. Lastly we give a proof of biautomaticity of $\pi_1(X_1)$, however the biautomaticity of $\pi_1(X_2)$ remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Regular polytopes of rank $n/2$ for transitive groups of degree $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research established that the maximal rank of the abstract regular polytopes whose automorphism group is a transitive proper subgroup of $\mbox{S}_n$ is $n/2 + 1$. Up to isomorphism and duality, when $n\geq 12$, there are only two polytopes attaining this rank and they occur when $n/2$ is odd, and hence have even rank.
  In this paper, we investigate the case where the rank is equal to $n/2$ ($n\geq 14$). Our analysis suggests that reducing the rank by one results in a substantial increase in the number of regular polytopes.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define \[ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.\] In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</description>

Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>

      <title>On the Graham--Sloane harmonious labelling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05280</link>

Abstract: Consider an order $n$ abelian group $G$ and a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. When is it possible to (bijectively) label $V(T)$ by $G$ so that along all edges $xy$ of $T$, the sums $x+y$ are distinct? This problem can be traced back to the work of Graham and Sloane on the harmonious labelling conjecture, and has been studied extensively since its introduction in 1980. We give a precise characterisation that holds for all bounded degree trees. In particular, our characterisation implies that if $G=\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and $T$ is a bounded degree tree, the desired labelling exists. This confirms a conjecture of Graham and Sloane from 1980, and another conjecture of Chang, Hsu, and Rogers from 1987, for bounded degree trees. Our results also have further applications for the study of graph coverings.</description>

      <title>On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Brou\'e conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that these RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that in most cases the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture for most of these RoCK blocks.</description>
