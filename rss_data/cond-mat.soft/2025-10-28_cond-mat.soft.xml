      <title>Convective Flows in Sheared Packings of Spherical Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how granular materials respond to shear stress remains a central challenge in soft matter physics. We report direct observations of persistent granular convection in the bulk shear zones of spherical particle packings -- a phenomenon previously associated primarily with particle shape anisotropy or boundary effects. By employing various bead-coloring techniques in a split-bottom geometry, we reveal internal flow fields within sheared granular packings. We find robust convective structures, strikingly governed by system geometry: at low filling heights, two counter-rotating convection rolls emerge, while at higher filling heights, a single dominant convection cell forms, featuring radially outward flow at the surface. This transition is driven by the height-dependent broadening of the shear zone, which introduces shear rate asymmetry across its flanks. Notably, the transition occurs entirely within the open shear band regime. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of system geometry for secondary flow formation in dense packings of frictional particles, with significant implications for geophysical flows and industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Vector Nematodynamics with Symmetry-driven Energy Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review inadequacy of existing nematodynamic theories and suggest a novel way of establishing relations between nematic orientation and flow based on the \emph{local} symmetry between simultaneous rotation of nematic alignment and flow, which establishes energy exchange between the the two without reducing the problem to near-equilibrium conditions and invoking Onsager's relations. This approach, applied in the framework of the vector-based theory with a variable modulus, involves antisymmetric interactions between nematic alignment and flow and avoids spurious instabilities in the absence of an active inputs.</description>

      <title>Morphology, Polarization Patterns, Compression, and Entropy Production in Phase-Separating Active Dumbbell Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar patterns and topological defects are ubiquitous in active matter. In this paper, we study a paradigmatic polar active dumbbell system through numerical simulations, to clarify how polar patterns and defects emerge and shape evolution. We focus on the interplay between these patterns and morphology, domain growth, irreversibility, and compressibility, tuned by dumbbell rigidity and interaction strength. Our results show that, when separated through MIPS, dumbbells with softer interactions can slide one relative to each other and compress more easily, producing blurred hexatic patterns, polarization patterns extended across entire hexatically varied domains, and stronger compression effects. Analysis of isolated domains reveals the consistent presence of inward-pointing topological defects that drive cluster compression and generate non-trivial density profiles, whose magnitude and extension are ruled by the rigidity of the pairwise potential. Investigation of entropy production reveals instead that clusters hosting an aster (spiral) defect are characterized by a flat (increasing) entropy profile mirroring the underlying polarization structure, thus suggesting an alternative avenue to distinguish topological defects on thermodynamical grounds. Overall, our study highlights how interaction strength and defect-compression interplay affect cluster evolution in particle-based active models, and also provides connections with recent studies of continuum polar active field models.</description>

      <title>Motile Bacteria-laden Droplets Exhibit Reduced Adhesion and Anomalous Wetting Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Bacterial contamination of surfaces poses a major threat to public health. Designing effective antibacterial or self-cleaning surfaces requires understanding how bacteria-laden droplets interact with solid substrates and how readily they can be removed. We hypothesize that bacterial motility critically influences the early-stage surface interaction (i.e., surface adhesion) of bacteria-laden droplets, which cannot be captured by conventional contact angle goniometry. Experiments: Sessile droplets containing live and dead Escherichia coli (E. coli) were studied to probe their wetting and interfacial behavior. Contact angle goniometry was used to probe dynamic wetting, while a cantilever-deflection-based method was used to quantify adhesion. Internal flow dynamics were visualized using micro-particle image velocimetry (PIV) and analyzed statistically. Complementary sliding experiments on moderately wettable substrates were performed to assess contact line mobility under tilt. Findings: Despite lower surface tension, droplets containing live bacteria exhibited lower surface adhesion forces than their dead counterparts, with adhesion further decreasing at higher bacterial concentrations. Micro-PIV revealed that flagellated live E. coli actively resist evaporation-driven capillary flow via upstream migration, while at higher concentrations, collective dynamics emerge, producing spatially coherent bacterial motion despite temporal variability. These coordinated flows disrupt passive transport and promote depinning of the contact line, thereby reducing adhesion. Sliding experiments confirmed enhanced contact line mobility and frequent stick-slip motion in live droplets, even with lower receding contact angles and higher hysteresis. These findings provide mechanistic insight into droplet retention, informing the design of self-cleaning/antifouling surfaces.</description>

      <title>Breaking Ion Clusters: Size Asymmetry for Faster Ion Transport in Polymer Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are ion-containing solid materials composed of a polymer matrix that enables ionic transport while maintaining the mechanical stability. The conventional wisdom is that for a high ion concentration, ions microphase separate from the polymer matrix, resulting in poor conductivity. Instead, we show that a high ion size ratio promotes better mixing of the ions with the polymer matrix. Under these conditions, the ion-dipole moment interaction dominates over the ion-ion interaction and improves the ion dispersion in the polymer matrix. The ion size ratio is thus a key to tailor the properties of these materials with immediate relevance to the development of SPEs for energy storage devices.</description>

      <title>Positive Feedback Drives Sharp Swelling of Polymer Brushes near Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the Schr\"{o}der paradox for PNiPAAm brushes, showing experimentally that swelling at 100\% relative humidity (RH) matches the liquid state. This occurs via a sharp increase in swelling above 98\%~RH, a behavior standard models fail to explain. Our extended mean-field theory explains this via a positive feedback between swelling and solvent quality, driven by a concentration-dependent $\chi$ parameter. The swelling isotherm quantitatively predicts the dynamic wetting crossover: the advancing contact angle at high velocities drops sharply as ambient humidity surpasses the 98\%~RH threshold.</description>

      <title>Rheological Lunar Regolith Simulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regolith simulants are essential for space research and technology development. Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ, that experience notably reduced gravity.
  We focus on lunar regolith simulants and explore various techniques to modify existing simulants to replicate the mechanical/rheological behavior of Moon regolith in true lunar conditions. Our results are validated against data from in-situ tests conducted during the Luna and Apollo missions, enabling a direct comparison of physical properties of our enhanced simulants to true Lunar regolith, on the Moon. Analyzed in the Mohr-Coulomb model framework, the friction angle of most simulants is generally close to that of true regolith, but the measured cohesion is often higher on the Moon, notably due to the reduced gravity environment. We propose a method to increase the cohesion of an existing simulant and assess the mechanical behavior of our rheological regolith simulant using a standardized geotechnical, shear test. The experimental results are then directly compared to in-situ data, providing a quantitative basis for evaluating the fidelity of the enhanced simulants.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Contraction-Induced Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peristalsis is the driving mechanism behind a broad array of biological and engineered flows. In peristaltic pumping, a wave-like contraction of the tube wall produces local changes in volume which induce flow. Net flow arises due to geometric nonlinearities in the momentum equation, which must be properly captured to compute the flow accurately. While most previous models focus on radius-imposed peristalsis, they often neglect longitudinal length changes - a natural consequence of radial contraction in elastic materials. In this paper, to capture a more accurate picture of peristaltic pumping, we calculate the flow in an elastic vessel undergoing contractions in the transverse and longitudinal directions simultaneously, keeping the geometric nonlinearities arising in the strain. A careful analysis requires us to study our fluid using the Lagrangian coordinates of the elastic tube. We perform analytic calculations of the flow characteristics by studying the fluid inside a fixed boundary with time-dependent metric. This mathematical manipulation works even for large-amplitude contractions, as we confirm by comparing our analytical results to COMSOL simulations. We demonstrate that transverse and longitudinal contractions induce instantaneous flows at the same order in wall strain, but in opposite directions. We investigate the influence of the wall's Poisson ratio on the flow profile. Incompressible walls suppress flow by minimizing local volume changes, whereas auxetic walls enhance flow. For radius-imposed peristaltic waves, wall incompressibility reduces both reflux and particle trapping. In contrast, length-imposed waves typically generate backflow, although trapping can still occur at large amplitudes for some Poisson ratios. These results yield a more complete description of peristalsis in elastic media and offer a framework for studying contraction-induced flows more broadly.</description>

      <title>On distinguishability among cell-division models based on population and single-cell-level distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the different cell-division models, such as Timer, Sizer, and Adder, can be distinguished based on the correlations between different single-cell-level quantities such as birth-size, division-time, division-size, and division-added-size. Here, we show that other statistical properties of these quantities can also be used to distinguish between them. Additionally, the statistical relationships and different correlation patterns can also differentiate between the different types of single-cell growth, such as linear and exponential. Further, we demonstrate that various population-level distributions, such as age, size, and added-size distributions, are indistinguishable across different models of cell division despite them having different division rules and correlation patterns. Moreover, this indistinguishability is robust to stochasticity in growth rate and holds for both exponential and linear growth. Finally, we show that our theoretical predictions are corroborated by simulations and supported by existing single-cell experimental data.</description>

      <title>Singular density correlations in chiral active fluids in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations in three-dimensional chiral active fluids by using a simple model of helical self-propelled particles. Helical motion is generated by a constant angular velocity (or chiral torque) acting on the self-propelled force. The chiral torque is assumed to have the same direction and magnitude for all particles. Due to the helical nature of the particle motion, the system is generically anisotropic even when it is spatially homogeneous. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the helicity induces an anisotropic pattern and a singularity in the static structure factor (the density correlation function in Fourier space) in the low-wavenumber limit. Moreover, the system in the limit of infinite persistence time exhibits hyperuniformity in the direction perpendicular to the chiral torque, while giant density fluctuations emerge along the parallel direction. We then construct a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for the system to describe the singular behavior. A linear analysis of the resulting equations yields an analytical expression for the static structure factor, which qualitatively agrees with our numerical findings.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network-Assisted Boltzmann Approach for Dilute Microswimmer Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a neural-network-assisted Boltzmann framework that learns the binary-collision map of microswimmers directly from data and uses it to evaluate collision integrals efficiently. Using a representative model swimmer, the learned map quantitatively predicts translational and rotational diffusivities and enables a linear-stability analysis of isotropy against polar ordering in dilute suspensions. The resulting predictions closely match direct simulations. The present framework is agnostic to active matter models and broadly applicable: once two-body collision data are obtained -- either from simulations or experiments -- the same surrogate can be used to evaluate kinetic transport across dilute conditions where binary collisions dominate. Because the workflow relies only on pre- and post-collision statistics, the present approach provides a general data-driven route linking particle-scale interactions to macroscopic transport and collective behavior in active suspensions.</description>
