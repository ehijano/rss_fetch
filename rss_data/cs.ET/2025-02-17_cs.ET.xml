      <title>Statistical data analysis for Tourism in Poland in R Programming Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study utilises the R programming language for statistical data analysis to understand Tourism dynamics in Poland. It focuses on methods for data visualisation, multivariate statistics, and hypothesis testing. To investigate the expenditure behavior of tourist, spending patterns, correlations, and associations among variables were analysed in the dataset. The results revealed a significant relationship between accommodation type and the purpose of trip, showing that the purpose of a trip impacts the selection of accommodation. A strong correlation was observed between organizer expenditure and private expenditure, indicating that individual spending are more when the spending on organizing the trip are higher. However, no significant difference was observed in total expenditure across different accommodation types and purpose of the trip revealing that travelers tend to spend similar amounts regardless of their reason for travel or choice of accommodation. Although significant relationships were observed among certain variables, ANOVA could not be applied because the dataset was not able to hold on the normality assumption. In future, the dataset can be explored further to find more meaningful insights. The developed code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/SaadAhmedJamal/DataAnalysis RProgEnv.</description>

      <title>Seamless acceleration of Fortran intrinsics via AMD AI engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge that the HPC community faces is how to continue delivering the performance demanded by scientific programmers, whilst meeting an increased emphasis on sustainable operations. Specialised architectures, such as FPGAs and AMD's AI Engines (AIEs), have been demonstrated to provide significant energy efficiency advantages, however a major challenge is that to most effectively program these architectures requires significant expertise and investment of time which is a major blocker.
  Fortran in the lingua franca of scientific computing, and in this paper we explore automatically accelerating Fortran intrinsics via the AIEs in AMD's Ryzen AI CPU. Leveraging the open source Flang compiler and MLIR ecosystem, we describe an approach that lowers the MLIR linear algebra dialect to AMD's AIE dialects, and demonstrate that for suitable workloads the AIEs can provide significant performance advantages over the CPU without any code modifications required by the programmer.</description>

      <title>Investigations of multi-socket high core count RISC-V for HPC workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whilst RISC-V has become popular in fields such as embedded computing, it is yet to find mainstream success in High Performance Computing (HPC). However, the 64-core RISC-V Sophon SG2042 is a potential game changer as it provides a commodity available CPU with much higher core count than existing technologies. In this work we benchmark the SG2042 CPU hosted in an experimental, dual-socket, system to explore the performance properties of the CPU when running a common HPC benchmark suite across sockets. Earlier benchmarks found that, on the Milk-V Pioneer workstation, whilst the SG2042 performs well for compute bound codes, it struggles when pressure is placed on the memory subsystem. The performance results reported here confirm that, even on a different system, these memory performance limitations are still present and hence inherent in the CPU. However, a multi-socket configuration does enable the CPU to scale to a larger number of threads which, in the main, delivers an improvement in performance and-so this is a realistic system configuration for the HPC community.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Ambient Drift and Negative-Bias Temperature Instability in Foundry Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Back-end-of-line (BEOL) logic integration is emerging as a complementary scaling path to supplement front-end-of-line (FEOL) Silicon. Among various options for BEOL logic, Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) have been integrated within commercial silicon foundries, and complex CNFET circuits (e.g., RISC-V core, SRAM arrays) have been demonstrated. However, there lacks comprehensive studies that analyze the ambient drift (i.e., air-stability) and reliability of CNFETs. Here, for the first time, we thoroughly characterize and demonstrate how to overcome ambient drift and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in CNFETs using the following techniques: (1) Silicon Nitride encapsulation to limit ambient atmosphere induced threshold voltage shift (~8x reduction of median VT shift over 90 days) and (2) AC/pulsed operation to significantly improve CNFET NBTI vs. DC operation across a wide frequency range (e.g., 20% duty cycle AC operation at 10 MHz could extend CNFET NBTI time-to-failure by &gt;10000x vs. DC for a target VT shift tolerance &lt; 100 mV with gate stress bias VGS,stress = -1.2 V at 125 C).</description>

      <title>Bayes2IMC: In-Memory Computing for Bayesian Binary Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide superior estimates of uncertainty by generating an ensemble of predictive distributions. However, inference via ensembling is resource-intensive, requiring additional entropy sources to generate stochasticity which increases resource consumption. We introduce Bayes2IMC, an in-memory computing (IMC) architecture designed for binary Bayesian neural networks that leverage nanoscale device stochasticity to generate desired distributions. Our novel approach utilizes Phase-Change Memory (PCM) to harness inherent noise characteristics, enabling the creation of a binary neural network. This design eliminates the necessity for a pre-neuron Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), significantly improving power and area efficiency. We also develop a hardware-software co-optimized correction method applied solely on the logits in the final layer to reduce device-induced accuracy variations across deployments on hardware. Additionally, we devise a simple compensation technique that ensures no drop in classification accuracy despite conductance drift of PCM. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a VGGBinaryConnect model, achieving accuracy metrics comparable to ideal software implementations as well as results reported in the literature using other technologies. Finally, we present a complete core architecture and compare its projected power, performance, and area efficiency against an equivalent SRAM baseline, showing a $3.8$ to $9.6 \times$ improvement in total efficiency (in GOPS/W/mm$^2$) and a $2.2 $ to $5.6 \times$ improvement in power efficiency (in GOPS/W). In addition, the projected hardware performance of Bayes2IMC surpasses that of most of the BNN architectures based on memristive devices reported in the literature, and achieves up to $20\%$ higher power efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>
