      <title>Corvus A: A low-mass, isolated galaxy at 3.5 Mpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of Corvus A, a low-mass, gas-rich galaxy at a distance of approximately 3.5 Mpc, identified in DR10 of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Imaging Survey during the initial phase of our ongoing SEmi-Automated Machine LEarning Search for Semi-resolved galaxies (SEAMLESS). Jansky Very Large Array observations of Corvus A detect HI line emission at a radial velocity of $523\pm2$ km/s. Magellan/Megacam imaging reveals an irregular and complex stellar population with both young and old stars. We detect UV emission in Neil Gehrels Swift observations, indicative of recent star formation. However, there are no signs of HII regions in H$\alpha$ imaging from Steward Observatory's Kuiper telescope. Based on the Megacam color magnitude diagram we measure the distance to Corvus A via the tip-of-the-red-giant-branch standard candle as $3.48\pm0.24$ Mpc. This makes Corvus A remarkably isolated, with no known galaxy within $\sim$1 Mpc. Based on this distance, we estimate the HI and stellar mass of Corvus A to be $\log M_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 6.59$ and $\log M_\ast/\mathrm{M_\odot} = 6.0$. Although there are some signs of rotation, the HI distribution of Corvus A appears to be close to face-on, analogous to that of Leo T, and we therefore do not attempt to infer a dynamical mass from its HI line width. Higher resolution synthesis imaging is required to confirm this morphology and to draw robust conclusions from its gas kinematics.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic analysis of the ionizing photon production efficiency in JADES and CEERS: implications for the ionizing photon budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used a combined sample of JADES and CEERS objects in order to constrain ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) from JWST/NIRSpec and JWST/NIRCam data. We examine 163 objects at 1.06 &lt; z &lt; 6.71 with significant (3$\sigma$) spectroscopic detections of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in order to constrain intrinsic H$\alpha$ luminosities corrected from nebular dust attenuation via Balmer decrements. We constrain dust-corrected UV luminosities from best-fit spectral-energy distribution modeling. We find a sample median log$_{10}$($\xi{\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.29^{+0.29}_{-0.37}$, assuming f$_{\rm esc}$=0 for the escape fraction of Lyman continuum emission. We find significant correlation between $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$ and z, with 17 objects at z &gt; 4.64 having median log$_{10}$($\xi_{\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.38^{+0.38}){-0.38}$, with those below having log$_{10}$($\xi_{\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.24^{+0.30}_{-0.33}$. We also find significant, positive correlations between $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$ and LUV; W{\lambda}([O iii]); [O iii]{\lambda}5007/[O ii]{\lambda}{\lambda}3726, 3729; and inverse correlations with metallicity. In contrast with some previous results, we find no trends between $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$ and stellar mass, stellar dust attenuation, or UV slope. Applying a multivariate fit to $\xi_{\rm ion,0}$, z, and MUV to an empirically-motivated model of reionization, and folding in f$_{\rm esc}$ estimates from direct observations of the Lyman continuum at z ~ 3 from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic survey, we find that the number of ionizing photons entering the IGM causes reionization to end at z ~ 5 - 7.</description>

      <title>From Halos to Galaxies. IX. Estimate of Halo Assembly History for SDSS Galaxy Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the galaxies are tightly connected to their host halo mass and halo assembly history. Accurate measurement of the halo assembly history in observation is challenging but crucial to the understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio ($M_*/M_{\mathrm{h}}$) for the centrals has often been used to indicate the halo assembly time $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$ of the group, where $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$ is the lookback time at which a halo has assembled half of its present-day virial mass. Using mock data from the semi-analytic models, we find that $M_*/M_{\mathrm{h}}$ shows a significant scatter with $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$, with a strong systematic difference between the group with a star-forming central (blue group) and passive central (red group). To improve the accuracy, we develop machine-learning models to estimate $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$ for galaxy groups using only observable quantities in the mocks. Since star-formation quenching will decouple the co-growth of the dark matter and baryon, we train our models separately for blue and red groups. Our models have successfully recovered $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$, within an accuracy of $\sim$ 1.09 Gyr. With careful calibrations of individual observable quantities in the mocks with SDSS observations, we apply the trained models to the SDSS Yang et al. groups and derive the $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$ for each group for the first time. The derived SDSS $t_{\mathrm{h,50}}$ distributions are in good agreement with that in the mocks, in particular for blue groups. The derived halo assembly history, together with the halo mass, make an important step forward in studying the halo-galaxy connections in observation.</description>

      <title>Simulations of cluster ultra-diffuse galaxies in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster have velocity dispersion profiles that are in full agreement with the predictions of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in isolation. However, the external field effect (EFE) from the cluster seriously deteriorates this agreement. It has been suggested that this could be related to the fact that UDGs are out-of-equilibrium objects whose stars have been heated by the cluster tides or that they recently fell onto the cluster on radial orbits, such that their velocity dispersion may not reflect the EFE at their instantaneous distance from the cluster center. Here, we simulate UDGs within the Coma cluster in MOND, using the Phantom of Ramses (\textsc{por}) code, and show that if UDGs are initially at equilibrium within the cluster, tides are not sufficient to increase their velocity dispersions to values as high as the observed ones. On the other hand, if they are on a first radial infall onto the cluster, they can keep high velocity dispersions without being destroyed until their first pericentric passage. We conclude that, without alterations such as a screening of the EFE in galaxy clusters or much higher baryonic masses than currently estimated, in the MOND context UDGs must be out-of-equilibrium objects on their first infall onto the cluster.</description>

      <title>Rest-Frame Optical Spectroscopy of Ten z $\sim$ 2 Weak Emission-Line Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present near-infrared spectroscopy of ten weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) at redshifts of $z\sim2$, obtained with the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope. WLQs are an exceptional population of type 1 quasars that exhibit weak or no broad emission lines in the ultraviolet (e.g., the C IV $\lambda 1549$ line), and they display remarkable X-ray properties. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\rm 1.7 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value $0.5)$ for our sources. We confirm the previous finding that WLQ H$\beta$ lines, as a major low-ionization line, are not significantly weak compared to typical quasars. The most prominent feature of the WLQ optical spectra is the universally weak/absent [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission. They also display stronger optical Fe II emission than typical quasars. Our results favor the super-Eddington accretion scenario for WLQs, where the weak lines are a result of a soft ionizing continuum; the geometrically thick inner accretion disk and/or its associated outflow is responsible for obscuring the nuclear high-energy radiation and producing the soft ionizing continuum. We also report candidate extreme [O III] outflows (blueshifts of $\approx 500$ and $\rm 4900 km s^{-1}$) in one object.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter and Mid-Infrared Variability of Young Stellar Objects in the M17SWex Intermediate-Mass Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO) variability within the M17 Southwest Extension (M17 SWex), using 3.5 years of monitoring data from the JCMT Transient Survey at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) and 9 years from the NEOWISE mission at mid-infrared (mid-IR). Our study encompasses observations of 147 bright sub-mm peaks identified within our deep JCMT co-added map as well as 156 YSOs in NEOWISE W1 and 179 in W2 that were previously identified in Spitzer surveys. We find three robust sub-mm variables: two are candidate YSOs and one is a likely extragalactic source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic variability in 47 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This is similar to what has previously been observed for low-mass YSO variability within the Gould Belt. However, we observe less overall variability in M17SWex at both the sub-mm and mid-IR. We suspect that this lower fraction is due to the greater distance to M17 SWex. Our findings showcase the utility of multi-wavelength observations to better capture the complex variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming environments.</description>

      <title>In-Depth Exploration of Catalytic Sites on Amorphous Solid Water: I. The Astrosynthesis of Aminomethanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical processes taking place on ice-grain mantles are pivotal to the complex chemistry of interstellar environments. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the catalytic effects of an amorphous solid water (ASW) surface on the reaction between ammonia (NH$_3$) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) to form aminomethanol (NH$_2$CH$_2$OH) using density functional theory. We identified potential catalytic sites based on the binding energy distribution of NH$_3$ and H$_2$CO reactants, on a set-of-clusters surface model composed of 22 water molecules and found a total of 14 reaction paths. Our results indicate that the catalytic sites can be categorized into four groups, depending on the interactions of the carbonyl oxygen and the amino group with the ice surface in the reactant complex. A detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism using Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate and reaction force analysis revealed three distinct chemical events for this reaction: formation of the C--N bond, breaking of the N--H bond, and formation of the O--H hydroxyl bond. Depending on the type of catalytic site, these events can occur within a single, concerted, albeit asynchronous, step, or can be isolated in a step-wise mechanism, with the lowest overall transition state energy observed at 1.3 kcal mol$^{-1}$. A key requirement for the low-energy mechanism is the presence of a pair of dangling OH bonds on the surface, found at 5\% of the potential catalytic sites on an ASW porous surface.</description>

      <title>The Host Galaxy Fluxes of Active Galaxy Nuclei Are Generally Overestimated by the Flux Variation Gradient Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In terms of the variable nature of normal active galaxy nuclei (AGN) and luminous quasars, a so-called flux variation gradient (FVG) method has been widely utilized to estimate the underlying non-variable host galaxy fluxes. The FVG method assumes an invariable AGN color, but this assumption has been questioned by the intrinsic color variation of quasars and local Seyfert galaxies. Here, using an up-to-date thermal fluctuation model to simulate multi-wavelength AGN variability, we theoretically demonstrate that the FVG method generally overestimates the host galaxy flux; that is, it is more significant for brighter AGN/quasars. Furthermore, we observationally confirm that the FVG method indeed overestimates the host galaxy flux by comparing it to that estimated through other independent methods. We thus caution that applying the FVG method should be performed carefully in the era of time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling relation incorporating the cusp-to-core transition of dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter haloes associated with galaxies have hitherto established strong correlations within a range of observed parameters, known as scaling relations of dark matter haloes. The origin of these scaling relations still contains significant ambiguities and requires comprehensive exploration for complete understanding. Utilising the correlation between the concentration and mass of dark matter haloes inferred from cosmological $N$-body simulations based on the cold dark matter paradigm ($c$-$M$ relation), we derive theoretical scaling relations among other physical quantities such as the surface mass density, the maximum circular velocity, and the scale radius of the dark matter halo. By comparing theoretical and observed scaling relations at various mass scales, it is found that the scaling relations observed in dwarf galaxies and galaxies originate in the $c$-$M$ relation of the dark matter halo. We predict that this theoretical scaling relation is also established in galaxy clusters. Moreover, we propose a novel theoretical scaling relation that incorporates the effects of the cusp-to-core transition, which is supposed to occur in cold dark matter haloes. Our discussion concludes with the exploration of potential observational verification of the cusp-to-core transition process in dark matter haloes.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden Inside of Gaia Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered binaries containing single BHs and visible stars without mass transfer, so-called Gaia BHs. One important question is if Gaia BHs have binary BHs (BBHs), hereafter Gaia BBHs, instead of single BHs. We have investigated how efficiently Gaia BBHs are formed in open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of Gaia BHs, by means of gravitational $N$-body simulations. Limiting Gaia BHs' periods to $10^2$-$10^4$ days, we have found that there are no Gaia BBHs in the solar-metallicity environments, while the formation efficiency of Gaia BBHs is not small ($\sim 10^{-6} M_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ % of Gaia BHs) in subsolar-metallicity environments. However, the probability of Gaia BBHs hidden in Gaia BHs is only $\sim 1$ %. This is because most of the BBHs merge within $1$ Gyr through gravitational wave radiation. Note that the ages of discovered Gaia BHs are more than $1$ Gyr. If we extend Gaia BHs' periods to $10^4$-$10^5$ days, the probability becomes higher to $\sim 10$ %. In this case, a large fraction of BBHs can have enough wide orbits not to merge within the Hubble time. The probability would not be high for Gaia BHs already discovered and to be discovered in the near future. Nevertheless, we have shown the BH/BBH mass, visible star mass, and eccentricity distributions of Gaia BHs and Gaia BBHs, which will be helpful for follow-up observations to discover Gaia BBHs. A Gaia BH would be more likely to be a Gaia BBH if it has younger age, longer period, lower-mass companion, more circular orbit, lower metallicity, and more massive BH. Our results have implied that Gaia BH3 is unlikely to be a Gaia BBH.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT observations of starburst galaxies and AGNs within the core of XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at $z$ = 1.46</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed radio study of the galaxy cluster XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at $z$ = 1.46 using MeerKAT $L$-band (1.3 GHz) observations. We combine our radio observation with archival optical and infrared data to investigate the star formation and AGN population within $R_{200}$ ($R = $ 0.8 Mpc) of the cluster centre. Using three selection criteria; the radio luminosity, the far-infrared radio ratio ($q_{\rm{IR}}$) and the mid-infrared colour, we distinguish galaxies with radio emission predominantly powered by star formation from that powered by AGNs. We selected 24 cluster members within $R_{\rm{200}}$ in the MeerKAT image based on either their photometric or spectroscopic redshift. We classified 12/24 ($50\%$) as galaxies whose radio emission is dominated by star-formation activity, 6/24 ($25\%$) as intermediate star-forming galaxies and 6/24 ($25\%$) as AGN-dominated galaxies. Using the radio continuum luminosities of the star-forming cluster galaxies, we estimated an integrated star formation rate (SFR) value of 1700 $\pm$ 330 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ within $R_{200}$. We derived a mass-normalized integrated SFR value of $(570 \pm 110) \times 10^{-14}$ yr$^{-1}$. This supports previous observational and theoretical studies that indicated a rapid increase in star formation activity within the core of high-redshift clusters. We also show that the high AGN fraction within the cluster core is consistent with previous cluster observations at $z &gt;$ 1.5.</description>

      <title>Compositions of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and Virgo Over-density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a sample of K giant from Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) Data Release 8 and a sample of RR Lyrae (RRL) from \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3, we investigate the compositions of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud (HAC) and Virgo Over-density (VOD) and their collective contribution to the tilt and triaxiality of the stellar halo ($r\,\textless\,40\,{\rm kpc}$) as well as two breaks at $\approx15\,{\rm kpc}$ and 30\,kpc. We apply the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to divide the stellar halo into the isotropic component and the radially biased anisotropic component, namely Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), and find that both HAC and VOD are dominated by the GSE debris stars with weights of $0.67^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and $0.57^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$, respectively. In addition, using the K giants with orbital parameters, we identify the member stars of known substructures, including GSE, Sagittarius (Sgr), Helmi Streams, Sequoia, Thamnos, Pontus, Wukong, and Metal-weak Thick Disk (MWTD), to probe the compositions of low-eccentricity stars in the HAC and VOD regions. In density fittings of the RRL sample, we note that the absence of HAC and VOD has a weak effect on the shape of halo. Finally, we find that the radially biased anisotropic halo contributes majorly to the stellar halo that can be modelled with a tilted triaxial ellipsoid and a doubly broken power law with breaking radii at $18.08^{+2.04}_{-3.22}\,{\rm kpc}$ and $33.03^{+1.30}_{-1.21}\,{\rm kpc}$. This has important significance for understanding the status of large diffuse over-densities in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>AstroSat/UVIT Study of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Radiation in the Dwarf Galaxy Holmberg II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of diffuse ultraviolet emission in the dwarf irregular galaxy Holmberg II obtained with the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat. With a spatial resolution of 1.2 to 1.6 arcsec, these are the highest resolution UV observations of the galaxy to date. We find that diffuse emission accounts for 70.6 % (58.1 %) of the total FUV(NUV) emission, respectively. We perform a UV-IR correlation study of the diffuse emission in this galaxy using infrared observations from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory for selected locations, free of detectable bright point sources. The strongest positive correlation between FUV and IR is observed at 70 micron for high HI density locations, indicating that warm dust grains dominate the IR emission, in agreement with earlier studies, while NUV is better correlated with 160 micron emission associated with cold dust grains. Low HI density regions or cavities, do not show any significant UV-IR correlation except at 160 micron, implying either the presence of colder dust grains in cavities, being irradiated by the general radiation field, or insufficient amount of dust. The dust scattering contribution in high HI density regions, estimated using a single scattering model with foreground dust clouds with LMC reddening, gives best-fit albedo and asymmetry factor values of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions for LMC dust. Our model derived scattering optical depths in the FUV range from 0.02 to 0.12, implying the medium is optically thin. Therefore, in high HI density regions, dust scattering can be one the sources of the observed diffuse UV emission, apart from possible contributions from molecular hydrogen fluorescence, However, the diffuse UV component in HI cavities can only be explained via other mechanisms, such as two photon emission.</description>

      <title>Silkscreen: Direct Measurements of Galaxy Distances from Survey Image Cutouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With upcoming wide field surveys from the ground and space the number of known dwarf galaxies at $\lesssim 25$ Mpc is expected to dramatically increase. Insight into their nature and analyses of these systems' intrinsic properties will rely on reliable distance estimates. Traditional techniques such as tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) or surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) are limited in their widespread applicability, especially in the semi-resolved regime. In this work we turn to the rapidly growing field of simulation based inference to infer distances, and other physical properties, of dwarf galaxies directly from multi-band images. We introduce Silkscreen: a code leveraging neural posterior estimation to infer the posterior distribution of parameters while simultaneously training a convolutional neural network to extract summary statistics from the images. Utilizing this combination of machine learning and Bayesian inference, we demonstrate the method's ability to recover accurate distances from ground-based survey images for a set of nearby galaxies ($2 &lt; D ({\rm Mpc)} &lt; 12$) with measured SBF or TRGB distances. We discuss caveats of the current implementation along with future prospects, focusing on the goal of amortized inference. For surveys like LSST, Silkscreen, once amortized, will facilitate inference for new dwarf galaxies in a matter of seconds using only broadband cutouts. While we focus here on dwarf galaxies, we note that this method can be generalized to more luminous systems as well.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of three new radio-powerful $z\sim5.6$ QSOs discovered from RACS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study on three new $z\sim5.6$ quasi stellar objects (QSOs) selected based on their radio and optical/near-infrared properties in publicly available surveys and then identified with dedicated spectroscopic observations. These are among the radio-brightest QSOs currently known at $z&gt;5.5$, having $\rm R=S_{\rm 5GHz}/S_{\rm 4400A}&gt;100$. In this work we present their identification and we also discuss their multi-wavelength properties (from the radio to the X-ray band) based on the detection in public surveys as well as dedicated radio and X-ray observations. The three sources present a wide range of properties, in terms of relative intensity and spectral shape, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations in order to accurately characterise these high-$z$ objects. In particular, from our analysis we found one source, at $z=5.61$, that presents clear blazars properties (strong and flat radio and X-ray emission), making it one of the most distant currently known in this class. Moreover, from the fit of the optical/near-infrared photometric measurements with an accretion disc model, as well as the analysis of the CIV broad emission line in one case, we were able to estimate the mass and the accretion rate of the central black holes in these systems, finding $\rm M_{\rm BH}\sim1-10\times10^9$ M$_\odot$ accreting at a rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1-0.2$. With this work we increase the number of very-high redshift radio-powerful QSOs characterised with multi-wavelength observations, essential in order to understand the evolution and the properties of this still poorly constrained class of sources.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular emissions associated with MgII absorptions detected in the SDSS spectra of background quasars</title>

Abstract: We present long-slit spectroscopic observations of 40 Galaxy On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs) at ${0.37 \leqslant z \leqslant 1.01}$ using the South African Large Telescope. Using this and available photometric data, we measure the impact parameters of the foreground galaxies to be in the range of 3$-$16 kpc with a median value of 8.6 kpc. This is the largest sample of galaxies producing MgII absorption at such low impact parameters. These quasar-galaxy pairs are ideal for probing the disk-halo interface. At such impact parameters, we do not find any significant anti-correlation between rest equivalent width (REW) of CaII, MnII, FeII, MgII, and MgI absorptions and impact parameters. These sight lines are typically redder than those of strong MgII absorbers, with the color excess, E(B$-$V) for our sample ranging from $-$0.191 to 0.422, with a median value of 0.058. In the E(B$-$V) vs. W$_{3935}$ plane, GOTOQs occupy the same region as CaII absorbers. For a given E(B$-$V), we find larger W$_{3935}$ than what has been found in the Milky Way, probably due to a smaller dust-to-gas ratio in GOTOQs. Galaxy parameters could be measured for twelve cases, and their properties seem to follow the trends found for strong MgII absorbers. Measuring the host galaxy properties for the full sample using HST photometry or AO-assisted ground-based imaging is important to gain insights into the relationship between the stellar mass of galaxies and the metal line REW distributions at low impact parameters.</description>

      <title>SUPER VIII. Fast and Furious at $z\sim2$: obscured type-2 active nuclei host faster ionised winds than type-1 systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved VLT/SINFONI spectroscopy with adaptive optics of type-2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the SINFONI Survey for Unveiling the Physics and Effect of Radiative feedback (SUPER), which targeted X-ray bright ($L_{2-10 keV}\gtrsim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) AGN at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$). Our analysis of the rest-frame optical spectra unveils ionised outflows in all seven examined targets, as traced via [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line emission, moving at $v\gtrsim600$ km s$^{-1}$. In six objects these outflows are clearly spatially resolved and extend on 2-4 kpc scales, whereas marginally resolved in the remaining one. Interestingly, these SUPER type-2 AGN are all heavily obscured sources ($N_{H}\gtrsim10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) and host faster ionised outflows than their type-1 counterparts within the same range of bolometric luminosity ($L_{bol} \sim 10^{44.8-46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$). SUPER has hence provided observational evidence that the type-1/type-2 dichotomy at $z\sim2$ might not be driven simply by projection effects, but might reflect two distinct obscuring life stages of active galaxies, as predicted by evolutionary models. Within this picture, SUPER type-2 AGN might be undergoing the 'blow-out' phase, where the large amount of obscuring material efficiently accelerates large-scale outflows via radiation pressure on dust, eventually unveiling the central active nucleus and signal the start of the bright, unobscured type-1 AGN phase. Moreover, the overall population of ionised outflows detected in SUPER has velocities comparable with the escape speed of their dark matter halos, and in general high enough to reach 30-50 kpc distances from the centre. These outflows are hence likely to sweep away the gas (at least) out of the baryonic disk and/or to heat the host gas reservoir, thus reducing and possibly quenching star formation.</description>

      <title>How does the successive buckling events affect a galaxy bar and stellar disk? Potential Observable Signatures For Spotting the Buckling Action -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until now, observations have caught up only a handful of galaxies in ongoing buckling action. Interestingly, N-body simulations over the past several decades show that almost every bar buckles or vertically thickens as soon as it reaches its peak strength during its evolution and leads to box$/$ peanut$/$ x (BPX) shapes. In order to understand the effect of multiple buckling events on the observable properties of galactic bar and disk, we perform an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-type disk. The axisymmetric galaxy disk forms a bar within a Gyr of its evolution and the bar undergoes two successive buckling events. We report that the time spans of these two buckling events are 220 Myr and 1 Gyr which have almost similar strengths of the bending modes. As a result of these two buckling events, the sizes of BPX shapes are around 5.8 kpc and 8.6 kpc which are around two-thirds of the bar length at the end of each buckling event. We find that the first buckling occurs at a smaller scale (radius less than 3 kpc) with a shorter time span affecting the larger length scales of the disk which is quantified in terms of changes in $m$ =2 and $m$ = 4 Fourier modes. While the second buckling occurs at larger scales (radius of around 6 kpc) affecting the inner disk the most. Finally, we provide observable kinematic signatures (for example quadrupolar patterns of the line-of-sight velocities) which can potentially differentiate the successive buckling events.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of Galactic H II regions with extended emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H II regions are the signposts of massive ($M\geq\,8\,M_\odot$) star-forming sites in our Galaxy. It has been observed that the ionizing photon rate inferred from the radio continuum emission of H II regions is significantly lower ($\sim$ 90%) than that inferred from far-infrared fluxes measured by IRAS. This discrepancy in the ionizing photon rates may arise due to there being significant amounts of dust within the H II regions or the presence of extended emission that is undetected by high-resolution radio interferometric observations. Here, we study a sample of eight compact and ultracompact H II regions with extended emission to explore its role in resolving the discrepancy. We have used observations at the uGMRT (1.25-1.45 GHz) and data from the GLOSTAR survey (4-8 GHz) to estimate the ionizing photon rate from the radio continuum emission. We have also estimated the ionizing photon rate from the infrared luminosity by fitting a spectral energy distribution function to the infrared data from the GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, and Hi-GAL surveys. The excellent sensitivity of the radio observations to extended emission allows us to investigate the actual fraction of ionizing photons that are absorbed by dust in compact and ultracompact H II regions. Barring one source, we find a direct association between the radio continuum emission from the compact and diffuse components of the H II region. Our study shows that the ionizing photon rates estimated using the radio and infrared data are within reasonable agreement (5-28%) if we include the extended emission. We also find multiple candidate ionizing stars in all our sources, and the ionizing photon rates from the radio observations and candidate stars are in reasonable agreement.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2: VIII. Investigating the Narrow Absorption Lines in Mrk 817 Using HST-COS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk817 during an intensive multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign for 16 months. Here, we examine the behavior of narrow UV absorption lines seen in HST/COS spectra, both during the campaign and in other epochs extending over 14 years. We conclude that while the narrow absorption outflow system (at -3750 km/s with FWHM=177 km/s) responds to the variations of the UV continuum as modified by the X-ray obscurer, its total column density (logNH =19.5 cm-2) did not change across all epochs. The adjusted ionization parameter (scaled with respect to the variations in the Hydrogen ionizing continuum flux) is log UH =-1.0. The outflow is located at a distance smaller than 38 parsecs from the central source, which implies a hydrogen density of nH &gt; 3000 cm-3. The absorption outflow system only covers the continuum emission source and not the broad emission line region, which suggests that its transverse size is small (&lt; 1e16 cm), with potential cloud geometries ranging from spherical to elongated along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>An Edge-on Regular Disk Galaxy at z=5.289</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While rotation-supported gas disks are known to exist as early as at z~7, it is still a general belief that stellar disks form late in the Universe. This picture is now being challenged by the observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which have revealed a large number of disk-like galaxies that could be at z&gt;3, with some being candidates at z&gt;7. As an early formation of stellar disks will greatly impact our theory of galaxy formation and evolution, it is important to determine when such systems first emerged. To date, there is only one confirmed case at z&gt;5 ("Twister-z5") reported in the literature. Here we present D-CEERS-z5289, a stellar disk at $z=5.289\pm0.001$ discovered using the archival JWST NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec spectroscopic data. This galaxy has a highly regular edge-on disk morphology, extends to ~6.2 kpc along its major axis, and has an effective radius of ~1.3--1.4 kpc. By analyzing its 10-band spectral energy distribution using four different tools, we find that it has a high stellar mass of 10^{9.5-10.0} Msun. Its age is in the range of 330--510 Myr, and it has a mild star formation rate of 10--30 Msun/yr. It is conceivable that this galaxy assembled its stellar mass by secular growth. Unfortunately, the current spectroscopic data do not allow the derivation of its rotation curve. Nevertheless, the width of its H$\alpha$ line (~345 km/s) from the partial slit coverage on one side of the disk suggests that it could be a fast-rotating system.</description>

      <title>Comparing metallicity correlations in nearby non-AGN and AGN-host galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity distribution within galaxies records critical information about galactic evolution. In this work we investigate how active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence this distribution by measuring the two-point correlation functions of gas-phase metallicity in 95 non-AGN and 37 AGN-host galaxies from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field spectroscopy Area integral field spectrographic survey. We measure metallicity using a novel Bayesian method that properly includes both stellar and AGN contributions to emission line fluxes and allows us to measure metallicities in both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies in a single, consistent framework. We find that the two-point correlation functions of both AGN-host and non-AGN galaxies are well-fit by a simple injection-diffusion model, and that the correlation lengths $l_\mathrm{corr}$ we derive for the non-AGN galaxies are reasonably consistent with those obtained in earlier work. The AGN-host galaxies generally have smaller $l_\mathrm{corr}$ than non-AGN galaxies at fixed stellar mass, but similar $l_\mathrm{corr}$ at fixed star formation rate (SFR), suggesting that the primary effect of hosting an AGN in this sample is a reduction in SFR at fixed stellar mass, and that this in turn suppresses the correlation length. Our findings further indicate that, while both SFR and stellar mass are positively correlated with metallicity correlation length $l_\mathrm{corr}$, the former is more fundamental, implying that fluctuations in the metallicity distribution within galaxies are driven more by short-term responses to physical processes such as star formation that can change much faster than a Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Dependence of Virial Factors on Optical Spectral Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverberation mapping (RM) has long been a powerful tool for measuring the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the precision of these mass measurements depends on the so-called virial factors. It has been demonstrated that the virial factors exhibit significant diversity, spanning approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude across different AGNs. However, the underlying physical drivers for the diversity have not yet been finalized. Here, adopting the SMBH mass -- spheroid luminosity relations of inactive galaxies with different bulge classifications, we calibrate the virial factors corresponding to the AGNs with pseudobulges (PB) and classical bulges (or elliptical hosts, CB) using the latest nearby RM sample. We investigate the correlations between virial factors and the AGN spectral properties, and find that for both PB and CB samples, the FWHM-based virial factors exhibit significant anti-correlations with the emission-line widths and profiles, while the $\sigma_{\rm line}$-based virial factors only show moderate anti-correlations with line widths for PB. We attribute these correlations mainly to the inclination angle or opening angle of the broad-line regions. Moreover, we establish new relations to give more precise virial factors and, in combination with the latest iron-corrected radius-luminosity relation, develop tentatively new single-epoch estimators of SMBH masses, which enable more accurate measurements of SMBH masses in large AGN samples.</description>

      <title>Limitations and rotation of the two-armed phase spiral in the Milky Way stellar disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The Milky Way's history of recent disturbances is vividly demonstrated by a structure in the vertical phase-space distribution known as the Gaia phase spiral. A one-armed phase spiral has been seen widely across the Milky Way disc, while a two-armed one has only been observed in the solar neighbourhood. Aims: This study aims to determine the properties of the two-armed phase spiral and to put it in a Galactic context, with the ultimate goal of understanding the structure and history of the Milky Way disc. Methods: The Gaia DR3 data is used to trace and characterise the two-armed phase spiral. Special focus is put on the phase spiral's spatial distribution, rotational behaviour, and chemical characteristics. To quantify the properties of the phase spiral we use a model that fits a spiral pattern to the phase space distribution of the stars. Results: We find that the two-armed phase spiral is detectable only within a narrow range of galactocentric distances and angular momenta in the solar neighbourhood, $R = 8 \pm 0.5 $ kpc, $L_Z = 1450 \pm 50$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. Outside this region, the phase spiral is one-armed. The two-armed phase spiral rotates with the phase angle, like the one-armed phase spiral, and changes axis ratio with phase angle. Additionally, stars within the phase-space overdensity caused by the two-armed phase spiral pattern have slightly higher mean metallicity than stars in the underdense regions of the pattern at equivalent galactocentric distances, angular momenta, and vertical orbit extents. Conclusions: The two-armed phase spiral rotates with phase angle and its effect can be seen in metallicity, like the one-armed phase spiral. However, the limited range over which it can be found, and its variation in shape are quite different from the one-armed version, suggesting it is a much more localised phenomenon in the Galactic disc.</description>

Abstract: With a luminosity similar to that of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) systems like Sextans, but a spatial extent similar to that of ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs), Andromeda (And) XIX is an unusual satellite of M31. To investigate the origin of this galaxy, we measure chemical abundances for AndXIX derived from medium-resolution (R$\sim$6000) spectra from Keck II/DEIMOS. We coadd 79 red giant branch stars, grouped by photometric metallicity, in order to obtain a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to measure 20 [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] abundances via spectral synthesis. The latter are the first such measurements for AndXIX. The mean metallicity we derive for AndXIX places it $\sim2\sigma$ higher than the present-day stellar mass-metallicity relation for Local Group dwarf galaxies, potentially indicating it has experienced tidal stripping. A loss of gas and associated quenching during such a process, which prevents the extended star formation necessary to produce shallow [$\alpha$/Fe]--[Fe/H] gradients in massive systems, is also consistent with the steeply decreasing [$\alpha$/Fe]--[Fe/H] trend we observe. In combination with the diffuse structure and disturbed kinematic properties of AndXIX, this suggests tidal interactions, rather than galaxy mergers, are strong contenders for its formation.</description>

      <title>Neutral atomic and molecular gas dynamics in the nearby spiral galaxies NGC 1512, NGC 4535, and NGC 7496</title>

Abstract: Neutral atomic gas (HI) effectively traces galactic dynamics across mid to large galactocentric radii. However, its limitations in observing small-scale changes within the central few kiloparsecs, coupled with the often observed HI deficit in galactic centers, necessitates using molecular gas emission as a preferred tracer in these regions. Understanding the dynamics of both neutral atomic and molecular gas is crucial for a more complete understanding of how galaxies evolve, funnel gas from the outer disk into their central parts, and eventually form stars. In this work we aim to quantify the dynamics of both, the neutral atomic and molecular gas, in the nearby spiral galaxies NGC 1512, NGC 4535, and NGC 7496 using new MeerKAT-HI observations together with ALMA CO (2-1) observations from the PHANGS collaboration. We use the analysis tool 3D-Barolo to fit tilted ring models to the HI and CO observations. A combined approach of using the HI to constrain the true disk orientation parameters before applying these to the CO datasets is tested. This paper sets expectations for the results of the upcoming high-resolution HI coverage of many galaxies in the PHANGS-ALMA sample using MeerKAT or VLA, to establish a robust methodology for characterizing galaxy orientations and deriving dynamics from combining new HI with existing CO data.</description>

      <title>Stellar Metallicities and Gradients in the Faint M31 Satellites Andromeda XVI and Andromeda XXVIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\sim300$ stellar metallicity measurements in two faint M31 dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XVI ($M_V = -7.5$) and Andromeda XXVIII ($M_V = -8.8$) derived using metallicity-sensitive Calcium H &amp; K narrow-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These are the first individual stellar metallicities in And~XVI (95 stars). Our And~XXVIII sample (191 stars) is a factor of $\sim15$ increase over literature metallicities. For And~XVI, we measure $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.17^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\nabla_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = -0.23\pm0.15$ dex $R_e^{-1}$. We find that And XVI is more metal-rich than MW UFDs of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended star formation history. For And XXVIII, we measure $\langle \mbox{[Fe/H]}\rangle = -1.95^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, $\sigma_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.34^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\nabla_{\mbox{[Fe/H]}} = -0.46 \pm 0.10$~dex~$R_e^{-1}$, placing it on the dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. Neither galaxy has a metallicity distribution function with an abrupt metal-rich truncation, suggesting that star formation fell off gradually. The stellar metallicity gradient measurements are among the first for faint ($L \lesssim 10^6~L_{\odot}$) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo. Both galaxies' gradients are consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations, where an age-gradient strength relationship is the observational consequence of stellar feedback that produces dark matter cores. We include a catalog for community spectroscopic follow-up, including 19 extremely metal poor ($\mbox{[Fe/H]} &lt; -3.0$) star candidates, which make up 7% of And~XVI's MDF and 6% of And~XXVIII's.</description>

      <title>Isochrone fitting to the open cluster M67 in the era of Gaia and improved model physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has provided highly accurate observations that have significantly reduced the scatter in the colour-magnitude diagrams of open clusters. As a result of the improved isochrone sequence of the open cluster M67, we have created new stellar models that avoid commonly used simplifications in 1D stellar modelling, such as mass-independent core overshooting and a constant mixing length parameter. This has enabled us to deliver a precise isochrone specifically designed for M67, available for download. We follow a commonly used qualitative approach to adjust the input physics to match the well-defined colour-magnitude sequence, and we test the model-predicted masses against a known eclipsing binary system at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster. Despite using improvements in photometry and stellar physics we cannot match the masses of both binary components with the same theoretical isochrone. A chi-square-based isochrone fitting approach using our preferred input physics results in a cluster age of 3.95+0.16-0.15 Gyrs.</description>

      <title>SDSSJ0018-0939: A Clear Signature of Sub-Chandrasekhar Mass Type 1a Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very metal-poor (VMP) stars (${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$) that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for $\alpha$ elements such as Mg, Si, and Ca, are referred to as $\alpha$-poor VMP stars. They are quite rare among VMP stars and are thought to have formed from gas enriched predominantly by a single Type Ia supernovae (SN 1a) in contrast to most VMP stars which are $\alpha$-enhanced and usually associated with core-collapse supernovae. The observed abundance pattern in such stars can provide a direct way to probe the nucleosynthesis in individual SN 1a. Although the abundance patterns in some $\alpha$-poor VMP stars have been shown to be consistent with SN 1a ejecta, a clear nucleosynthetic signature for SN 1a resulting from the explosion of a near Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) or a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) white dwarf, has not been unambiguously detected. We perform a detailed analysis of various formation channels of VMP stars and find that the $\alpha$-poor VMP star SDSSJ0018-0939, which was earlier reported as a star with potential pair-instability supernova origin, provides almost a smoking-gun signature of a sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a resulting from He detonation. We find that compared to other $\alpha$-poor VMP stars that were previously identified with SN 1a, SDSSJ0018-0939 is the only star that has a clear and unambiguous signature of SN 1a. Interestingly, our results are consistent with constraints on SN 1a from recent galactic chemical evolution studies that indicate that sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a account for $\sim 50\hbox{--}75\,\%$ of all SN 1a are and possibly the dominant channel in the early Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Centroiding Undersampled PSFs with a Lookup Table</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method of centroiding undersampled point spread functions (PSFs) that may be useful, especially when dithering is not an option. If the profile of the expected PSF is known fairly well through characterization of the telescope and detector used for observing, one can simulate the undersampled PSF at many positions on a simulated pixel grid. The true centroid positions are known since the PSFs are simulated, and so one can match up each undersampled PSF images to its true centroid location, thus forming a lookup table. One then assigns the centroid position of an observed PSF to the position associated with the PSF in the lookup table that has the smallest squared residual with respect to the observed PSF. We examine a few PSF sizes and demonstrate that the lookup table provides better centroid positions compared to a fitting algorithm when the PSFs are undersampled, even in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization: A view deep inside cosmic ray driven turbulence and particle acceleration in supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show here that highly polarized X-ray synchrotron radiation from young supernova remnants (SNRs) can be modeled within the framework of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and nonlinear magnetic turbulence generation.Cosmic ray acceleration by SNR shocks to very high energies requires efficient magnetic turbulence amplification in the shock precursor.As the strong turbulence generated by Bell's instability far upstream from the viscous subshock convects through the subshock, nonlinear dynamical effects on the compressible fluctuations produce a downstream layer filled with strong anisotropic turbulence with predominantly radial magnetic fields.The synchrotron radiation from shock accelerated electrons in the turbulent downstream layer has a high degree of polarization shown to be consistent with recent observations of young SNRs by IXPE.In the case of Tycho's SNR, the measured X-ray radiation constrains the thickness of the energy containing interval and the amplitude of cosmic ray driven magnetic turbulence, as well as the maximal energy of accelerated protons.The preferential direction of the X-ray polarization depends sensitively on the SNR shock velocity and the ambient density.A unique feature of our model is the sensitive dependence of the degree and direction of X-ray polarization on the spatial overlap between regions of amplified magnetic turbulence and TeV electron populations.While this overlap occurs on scales orders of magnitude below the resolution of IXPE,its polarization measurement allows testing of turbulent plasma processes on unprecedented scales.The mechanism of formation of highly polarized X-ray synchrotron radiation in fast shocks with high level of anisotropic turbulent magnetic field preferentially directed along the shock normal may be applied to other systems like shocks produced by black hole jets.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XII. A new grid of northern standards for the spectral classification of B-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, automated stellar parameter determination has become commonplace. Nevertheless, spectral classification still offers a quick and useful alternative for obtaining parameter estimates for large samples of spectra of varying quality. We present a new atlas of stellar spectra covering the B-type range, with the intention of providing detailed classification criteria valid for modern spectra and improving the grid of reliable standards. This new grid will be used in future works to provide classification criteria beyond the classical classification range and addressing, in particular, the use of Gaia/RVS spectra. We analysed historical standards by means of multiple high-resolution spectra, marking out problematic cases and complementing the grid with a new set of reliable comparators. We then elaborated on a new set of classification criteria based on high-quality R=4000 spectra. Our new classification grid is much thicker than any previous set of standards, presenting a high degree of self-consistency. Although it is based entirely on morphological criteria, the grid demonstrates a much better correlation with different physical parameters. The new grid can be used to study classification criteria in other spectral ranges, providing a valuable tool for the study of B-type stars that covers a very wide range of temperatures, luminosities, and stellar masses. The very process of classification also offers valuable insights into stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey DR5.1 and Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec: a comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) The third data release of Gaia, has provided stellar parameters, metallicity [M/H], [{\alpha}/Fe], individual abundances, broadening parameter from its RVS spectra for about 5.6 million objects thanks to the GSP-Spec module. The catalogue publishes the radial velocity of 33 million sources. We took advantage of the intersections between Gaia RVS and Gaia-ESO to compare their stellar parameters, abundances and radial and rotational velocities. We aimed at verifying the overall agreement between the two datasets, considering the various calibrations and the quality-control flag system suggested for the Gaia GSP-Spec parameters. For the targets in common between Gaia RVS and Gaia-ESO, we performed several statistical checks on the distributions of their stellar parameters, abundances and velocities of targets in common. For the Gaia surface gravity and metallicity we considered both the uncalibrated and calibrated values. We find an excellent agreement between the Gaia and Gaia-ESO radial velocities given the uncertainties affecting each dataset. Less than 25 of ~2100 Gaia-ESO spectroscopic binaries are flagged as non-single stars by Gaia. The temperature scales are in good agreement. The calibrated GSP-Spec gravity should be preferred. We note that the quality (accuracy, precision) of the GSP-Spec parameters degrades quickly for objects fainter than G~11. We find that the somewhat imprecise GSP-Spec abundances due to its medium-resolution spectroscopy over a short wavelength window and the faint G regime of the sample under study can be counterbalanced by working with averaged quantities. We studied some properties of the open-cluster population: our combined sample traces very well the radial [Fe/H] and [Ca/Fe] gradients, the age-metallicity relations in different radial regions, and it places the clusters in the thin disc.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopic and kinematic survey of fast hot subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs (sdO/B) are the stripped helium cores of red giants formed by binary interactions. Close hot subdwarf binaries with massive white dwarf companions have been proposed as possible progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). If the supernova is triggered by stable mass transfer from the helium star, the companion should survive the explosion and should be accelerated to high velocities. The hypervelocity star US 708 is regarded as the prototype for such an ejected companion. To find more of those objects we conducted an extensive spectroscopic survey. Candidates for such fast stars have been selected from the spectroscopic database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and several ground-based proper motion surveys. Follow-up spectroscopy has been obtained with several 4m- to 10m-class telescopes. Combining the results from quantitative spectroscopic analyses with space-based astrometry from \textit{Gaia} Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) we determined the atmospheric and kinematic parameters of 53 fast hot subdwarf stars. None of these stars is unbound to the Galaxy, although some have Galactic restframe velocities close to the Galactic escape velocity. 21 stars are apparently single objects, which crossed the Galactic disc within their lifetimes in the sdO/B stage and could be regarded as potential candidates for the SN Ia ejection scenario. However, the properties of the full sample are more consistent with a pure old Galactic halo population. We therefore conclude that the fast sdO/B stars we found are likely to be extreme halo stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: With the data releases from the astrometric space mission Gaia, the exploration of the structure of the Milky Way has developed in unprecedented detail and unveiled many previously unknown structures in the Galactic disc and halo. One such feature is the phase spiral where the stars in the Galactic disc form a spiral density pattern in the $Z-V_Z$ plane. Aims: We aim to characterize the shape, rotation, amplitude, and metallicity of the phase spiral in the outer disc of the Milky Way. This will allow us to better understand which physical processes caused the phase spiral and can give further clues to the Milky Way's past and the events that contributed to its current state. Methods: We use Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to get full position and velocity data on approximately 31.5 million stars, and metallicity for a subset of them. We then compute the angular momenta of the stars and develop a model to characterise the phase spiral in terms of amplitude and rotation at different locations in the disc. Results: We find that the rotation angle of the phase spiral changes with Galactic azimuth and Galactocentric radius, making the phase spiral appear to rotate about $3^\circ$ per degree in Galactic azimuth. Furthermore, we find that the phase spiral in the $2200 - 2400$ kpc km s$^{-1}$ range of angular momentum is particularly strong compared to the phase spiral that can be observed in the solar neighbourhood. The metallicity of the phase spiral appears to match that of the Milky Way disc field stars. Conclusions: We created a new model capable of fitting several key parameters of the phase spiral. We have been able to determine the rotation rate of the phase spiral and found a peak in the phase spiral amplitude which manifests as a very clear phase spiral when using only stars with similar angular momentum.</description>

      <title>The Obsidian model: Three regimes of black hole feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theoretical models of galaxy evolution, black hole feedback is a necessary ingredient in order to explain the observed exponential decline in number density of massive galaxies. Most contemporary black hole feedback models in cosmological simulations rely on a constant radiative efficiency (usually $\eta \sim 0.1$) at all black hole accretion rates. We present the Obsidian sub-grid model, a synthesis model for the spin-dependent radiative efficiencies of three physical accretion rate regimes, i.e. $\eta = \eta(j, \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc})$, for use in large-volume cosmological simulations. The three regimes include: an advection dominated accretion flow ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &lt; 0.03\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$), a quasar-like mode ($0.03 &lt; \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 0.3$), and a slim disc mode ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &gt; 0.3\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$). Additionally, we include a large-scale powerful jet at low accretion rates. The black hole feedback model we present is a kinetic model that prescribes mass loadings but could be used in thermal models directly using the radiative efficiency. We implement the Obsidian model into the Simba galaxy evolution model to determine if it is possible to reproduce galaxy populations successfully, and provide a first calibration for further study. Using a $2\times1024^3$ particle cosmological simulation in a $(150\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume, we found that the model is successful in reproducing the galaxy stellar mass function, black hole mass-stellar mass relationship, and stellar mass-halo mass relationship. Moving forward, this model opens new avenues for exploration of the impact of black hole feedback on galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference methodology to characterize the dust emissivity at far-infrared and submillimeter frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inference method to characterise the dust emission properties using the well-known dust-HI correlation in the diffuse interstellar medium at Planck frequencies $\nu \ge 217$ GHz. We use the Galactic HI map from the Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) as a template to trace the Galactic dust emission. We jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity and the zero level present in the Planck intensity maps. We use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique to sample the high dimensional parameter space ($D \sim 10^3$). We demonstrate that the methodology leads to unbiased recovery of dust emissivity per pixel and the zero level when applied to realistic Planck sky simulations over a 6300 deg$^2$ area around the Southern Galactic pole. As an application on data, we analyse the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz to jointly infer the pixel-dependent dust emissivity at Nside=32 resolution (1.8\deg\ pixel size) and the global offset. We find that the spatially varying dust emissivity has a mean of 0.031 MJysr$^{-1} (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$ and $1\sigma$ standard deviation of 0.007 MJysr$^{-1} (10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}})^{-1}$. The mean dust emissivity increases monotonically with increasing mean HI column density. We find that the inferred global offset is consistent with the expected level of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) monopole added to the Planck data at 353 GHz. This method is useful in studying the line-of-sight variations of dust spectral energy distribution in the multi-phase interstellar medium.</description>

Abstract: We compare properties of classical and pseudo-bulges and properties of their hosting galaxies selected from the MaNGA survey. Bulge types are identified based on the S$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$rsic index n of bulge component and the position of bulges on the Kormandy diagram. For the 393 classical bulges and 422 pseudo-bulges selected and their hosting galaxies, we study their kinematic properties including a proxy for specific angular momentum and central velocity dispersion, their stellar population properties including stellar age, metallicity, and specific star formation rate, as well as HI fractions of the galaxies. Our results show that at given stellar mass, disc components of pseudo-bulge galaxies are younger, have more active star formation, rotate more, and may contain more HI content compared with those of classical bulge galaxies, and the differences are larger than those between bulges themselves. The correlations between bulge types and disc properties indicate that different types of bulges are shaped by different processes that may regulate both growth of central components and evolution of outer discs in galaxies. In addition, we propose a stellar mass dependent divider of central velocity dispersion to separate galaxies with classical bulges from those with pseudo-bulges in galaxy mass range of $10.4&lt;\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;11.4$: $\mathrm{log}(\sigma_0) = 0.23 \times \mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\odot)-0.46$. Galaxies with larger/smaller $\sigma_0$ can be classified as hosts of classical/pseudo-bulges.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Lensed Dusty Starburst of an Intrinsic Disk Morphology at Photometric Redshift of $z_{\rm ph}&gt;7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present COSBO-7, a strong millimeter (mm) source known for more than sixteen years but was just revealed its near-to-mid-IR counterpart by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The precise pin-pointing by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) on the exquisite NIRCam and MIRI images show that it is a background source gravitationally lensed by a single foreground galaxy, and the analysis of its spectral energy distribution by different tools is in favor of photometric redshift at $z_{\rm ph}&gt;7$. Strikingly, our lens modeling based on the JWST data shows that it has a regular, disk morphology in the source plane. The dusty region giving rise to the far-IR-to-mm emission seems to be confined to a limited region to one side of the disk and has a high dust temperature of $&gt;90$~K. The galaxy is experiencing starburst both within and outside of this dusty region. After taking the lensing magnification of $\mu\approx 2.5-3.6$ into account, the intrinsic star formation rate is several hundred $M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$ both within the dusty region and across the more extended stellar disk, and the latter already has $&gt;10^{10}M_\odot$ of stars in place. If it is indeed at $z&gt;7$, COSBO-7 presents an extraordinary case that is against the common wisdom about galaxy formation in the early universe; simply put, its existence poses a critical question to be answered: how could a massive disk galaxy come into being so early in the universe and sustain its regular morphology in the middle of an enormous starburst?</description>

      <title>[CII] luminosity models and large-scale image cubes based on COSMOS 2020 and ALPINE-ALMA [CII] data back to the epoch of reionisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have implemented a novel method to create simulated [CII] emission line intensity mapping (LIM) data cubes using COSMOS 2020 galaxy catalogue data. It allows us to provide solid lower limits for previous simulation-based model predictions and the expected signal strength of upcoming surveys. We applied [CII]158$\mu$m luminosity models to COSMOS 2020 to create LIM cubes covering a 1.2$\times$1.2 deg$^2$ sky area. These models were derived using galaxy bulk property data from the ALPINE-ALMA survey over the redshift range $4.4&lt;z&lt;5.9$, while additional models were taken from the literature. The cubes cover $3.42&lt;z&lt;3.87$, $4.14&lt;z&lt;4.76$, $5.34&lt;z&lt;6.31$, and $6.75&lt;z&lt;8.27$, matched to planned observations from the EoR-Spec module of the Prime-Cam instrument in the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST). We also created predictions including additional galaxies below current detection limits by `extrapolating' from the faint end of the COSMOS 2020 luminosity function, comparing these to predictions from the literature. In addition, we computed signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios for the power spectra, using parameters from the planned FYST survey with predicted instrumental noise levels. We find lower limits for the expected power spectrum using the likely incomplete empirical data: when normalised by $2\pi^2$, the amplitudes at $k$ = 1 Mpc$^{-1}$ are 3.06$\times$10$^7$, 1.43$\times$10$^7$, 9.80$\times$10$^5$, 2.77$\times$10$^5$ (Jy sr$^{-1}$)$^2$ for the aforementioned redshift ranges. For the extrapolated sample, the power spectra are consistent with prior predictions, indicating that extrapolation is a viable method for creating mock LIM cubes. In this case, we expect a result of S/N&gt;1 when using FYST parameters. However, our high-redshift results remain inconclusive because of the poor completeness of COSMOS 2020 at $z$&gt;6.3. These predictions will be improved on the basis of future JWST data.</description>

      <title>What drives the corpulence of galaxies? I. The formation of central compact dwarf galaxies in TNG50</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nearby dwarf galaxies display a variety of effective radii (sizes) at a given stellar mass, suggesting different evolution scenarios according to their final "stellar" size. The TNG hydrodynamical simulations present a bimodality in the z = 0 size - mass relation (SMRz0) of dwarf galaxies, at $r_{1/2,\star}$ ~ 450 pc. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explored the evolution of the most massive progenitors of dwarf galaxies (z=0 $\log( M_\star / \mathrm{M}_\odot)$ between 8.4 and 9.2) that end up as central galaxies of their groups. We split these dwarfs into three classes of the SMRz0: "Normals" from the central spine of the main branch, and "Compacts" from the secondary branch as well as the lower envelope of the main branch. Both classes of Compacts see their stellar sizes decrease from z ~ 1 onwards in contrast to Normals, while the sizes of the gas and dark matter (DM) components continue to increase (as for Normals). A detailed analysis reveals that Compacts live in poorer environments, and thus suffer fewer major mergers from z = 0.8 onwards, which otherwise would pump angular momentum into the gas, allowing strong gas inflows, producing inner star formation, and thus leading to the buildup of a stellar core. Compacts are predicted to be rounder and to have bluer cores. Compact dwarfs of similar sizes are observed in the GAMA survey, but the bimodality in size is less evident and the most compact dwarfs tend to be passive rather than star forming, as in TNG50. Our conclusions should therefore be confirmed with future cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec High-resolution Spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD at z=10.167: Resolved [OII] Doublet and Electron Density in an Early Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec high-resolution spectroscopy G395H/F290LP of MACS0647-JD, a gravitationally lensed galaxy merger at $z=10.167$. The new spectroscopy, which is acquired for the two lensed images (JD1 and JD2), detects and resolves emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and blue optical, including the resolved [OII]3726,3729 doublet, [NeIII]3870, [HeI]3890, H$\delta$, H$\gamma$, and [OIII]4363. This is the first observation of the resolved [OII]3726,3729 doublet for a galaxy at $z&gt;8$. We measure a line flux ratio [OII]3729/3726 $= 0.9 \pm 0.3$, which corresponds to an estimated electron density of $\log(n_{e} / \rm{cm}^{-3}) = 2.9 \pm 0.5$. This is significantly higher than the electron densities of local galaxies reported in the literature. We compile the measurements from the literature and further analyze the redshift evolution of $n_{e}$. We find that the redshift evolution follows the power-law form of $n_{e} = A\times (1+z)^{p}$ with $A=54^{+31}_{-23}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $p=1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$. This power-law form may be explained by a combination of metallicity and morphological evolution of galaxies, which become, on average, more metal-poor and more compact with increasing redshift.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Star Formation Efficiency in Dense Gas: Initial Results from the CAFFEINE Survey with ArT\'eMiS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent progress, the question of what regulates the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains one of the most debated problems in astrophysics. According to the dominant picture, star formation (SF) is regulated by turbulence and feedback, and the SFE is 1-2% per local free-fall time. In an alternate scenario, the SF rate in galactic disks is linearly proportional to the mass of dense gas above a critical density threshold. We aim to discriminate between these two pictures thanks to high-resolution observations tracing dense gas and young stellar objects (YSOs) for a comprehensive sample of 49 nearby massive SF complexes out to d &lt; 3 kpc in the Galactic disk. We use data from CAFFEINE, a 350/450 $\mu$m survey with APEX/ArT\'eMiS of the densest portions of all southern molecular clouds, in combination with Herschel data to produce column density maps at 8" resolution. Our maps are free of saturation and resolve the structure of dense gas and the typical 0.1 pc width of molecular filaments at 3 kpc, which is impossible with Herschel data alone. Coupled with SFR estimates derived from Spitzer observations of the YSO content of the same clouds, this allows us to study the dependence of the SFE with density in the CAFFEINE clouds. We also combine our findings with existing SFE measurements in nearby clouds to extend our analysis down to lower column densities. Our results suggest that the SFE does not increase with density above the critical threshold and support a scenario in which the SFE in dense gas is approximately constant. However, the SFE measurements traced by Class I YSOs in nearby clouds are more inconclusive, since they are consistent with both the presence of a density threshold and a dependence on density above the threshold. Overall, we suggest that the SFE in dense gas is primarily governed by the physics of filament fragmentation into protostellar cores.</description>

      <title>Pulsational mode stability in complex EiBI-gravitating polarized astroclouds with (r, q)-distributed electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pulsational mode of gravitational collapse (PMGC) originating from the combined gravito-electrostatic interaction in complex dust molecular clouds (DMCs) is a canonical mechanism leading to the onset of astronomical structure formation dynamics. A generalized semi-analytic model is formulated to explore the effects of the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity, non-thermal (r, q)-distributed electrons, and dust-polarization force on the PMGC stability concurrently. The thermal ions are treated thermo-statistically with the Maxwellian distribution law and the non-thermal electrons with the (r, q)-distribution law. The constitutive partially ionized dust grains are modeled in the fluid fabric. A spherical normal mode analysis yields a generalized linear PMGC dispersion relation. Its oscillatory and propagation characteristics are investigated in a reasonable numerical platform. It is found that an increase in the polarization force and positive EiBI parameter significantly enhances the instability, causing the DMC collapse and vice versa. The electron non-thermality spectral parameters play as vital stabilizing factors, and so on. Its reliability and applicability are finally outlined in light of astronomical predictions previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>NOEMA formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): Characterizing eight massive galaxy groups at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 4$ in the COSMOS field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NOEMA formIng Cluster survEy (NICE) is a large program targeting 69 massive galaxy group candidates at $z&gt;2$ in six deep fields. We report spectroscopic confirmation of eight groups at $1.65\leq z\leq3.61$ in COSMOS. Homogeneously selected as significant overdensities of red IRAC sources with red Herschel colors, four groups are confirmed by CO and [CI] with NOEMA 3mm observations, three are confirmed with ALMA, and one is confirmed by H$\alpha$ from Subaru/FMOS. We constructed the integrated FIR SEDs for the eight groups, obtaining total IR SFR $=260-1300~{\rm M_\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. We adopted six methods to estimate the dark matter masses, including stellar mass to halo mass relations, overdensity with galaxy bias, and NFW profile fitting to radial stellar mass density. We found the radial stellar mass density are consistent with a NFW profile, supporting that they are collapsed structures hosted by a single dark matter halo. The best halo mass estimates are $\log(M_{\rm h}/{\rm M_\odot})=12.8-13.7$ with uncertainty of 0.3 dex. From halo mass estimates, we derive baryonic accretion rate ${\rm BAR}=(1-8)\times10^{3}\,{\rm M_{\odot}/yr}$ for this sample. We find a quasi-linear correlation between the integrated SFR/BAR and the theoretical halo mass limit for cold streams, $M_{\rm stream}/M_{\rm h}$, with ${\rm SFR/BAR}=10^{-0.46\pm0.22}\left({M_{\rm stream}/M_{\rm h}}\right)^{0.71\pm0.16}$ with a scatter of $0.40\,{\rm dex}$. Further, we compare halo masses and stellar masses with simulations, and find all structures are consistent with being progenitors of $M_{\rm h}(z=0)&gt;10^{14}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxy clusters, and the most massive central galaxies have stellar masses consistent with brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) progenitors in the TNG300 simulation. The results strongly suggest these structures are forming massive galaxy clusters via baryonic and dark matter accretion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $&gt;$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO. XVI. Measurement of the Hubble Constant from the Lensed Quasar WGD$\,$2038$-$4008</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-delay cosmography is a powerful technique to constrain cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant ($H_{0}$). The TDCOSMO collaboration is performing an ongoing analysis of lensed quasars to constrain cosmology using this method. In this work, we obtain constraints from the lensed quasar WGD 2038-4008 using new time-delay measurements and previous mass models by TDCOSMO. This is the first TDCOSMO lens to incorporate multiple lens modeling codes and the full time-delay covariance matrix into the cosmological inference. The models are fixed before the time delay is measured, and the analysis is performed blinded with respect to the cosmological parameters to prevent unconscious experimenter bias. We obtain $D_{\Delta t} = 1.68^{+0.40}_{-0.38}$ Gpc using two families of mass models, a power-law describing the total mass distribution, and a composite model of baryons and dark matter, although the composite model is disfavored due to kinematics constraints. In a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we constrain the Hubble constant to be $H_{0} = 65^{+23}_{-14}\, \rm km\ s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. The dominant source of uncertainty comes from the time delays, due to the low variability of the quasar. Future long-term monitoring, especially in the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, could catch stronger quasar variability and further reduce the uncertainties. This system will be incorporated into an upcoming hierarchical analysis of the entire TDCOSMO sample, and improved time delays and spatially-resolved stellar kinematics could strengthen the constraints from this system in the future.</description>
