      <title>Low-Threshold Response of a Scintillating Xenon Bubble Chamber to Nuclear and Electronic Recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A device filled with pure xenon first demonstrated the ability to operate simultaneously as a bubble chamber and scintillation detector in 2017. Initial results from data taken at thermodynamic thresholds down to ~4 keV showed sensitivity to ~20 keV nuclear recoils with no observable bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray interactions. This paper presents results from further operation of the same device at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 0.50 keV, hardware limited. The bubble chamber has now been shown to have sensitivity to ~1 keV nuclear recoils while remaining insensitive to bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-rays. A robust calibration of the chamber's nuclear recoil nucleation response, as a function of nuclear recoil energy and thermodynamic state, is presented. Stringent upper limits are established for the probability of bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray-induced Auger cascades, with a limit of $&lt;1.1\times10^{-6}$ set at 0.50 keV, the lowest thermodynamic threshold explored.</description>

      <title>First experimental study of multiple orientation muon tomography, with image optimization in sparse data environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the high penetrating power of cosmic ray muons, they can be used to probe very thick and dense objects. As charged particles, they can be tracked by ionization detectors, determining the position and direction of the muons. With detectors on either side of an object, particle direction changes can be used to extract scattering information within an object. This can be used to produce a scattering intensity image within the object related to density and atomic number. Such imaging is typically performed with a single detector-object orientation, taking advantage of the more intense downward flux of muons, producing planar imaging with some depth-of-field information in the third dimension. Several simulation studies have been published with multi-orientation tomography, which can form a three-dimensional representation faster than a single orientation view. In this work we present the first experimental multiple orientation muon tomography study. Experimental muon-scatter based tomography was performed using a concrete filled steel drum with several different metal wedges inside, between detector planes. Data was collected from different detector-object orientations by rotating the steel drum. The data collected from each orientation were then combined using two different tomographic methods.
  Results showed that using a combination of multiple depth-of-field reconstructions, rather than a traditional inverse Radon transform approach used for CT, resulted in more useful images for sparser data. As cosmic ray muon flux imaging is rate limited, the imaging techniques were compared for sparse data. Using the combined depth-of-field reconstruction technique, fewer detector-object orientations were needed to reconstruct images that could be used to differentiate the metal wedge compositions.</description>

      <title>Re-investigation of neutron capture by 84Kr and 86Kr in the s-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermonuclear reaction rates and Maxwellian averaged cross sections (MACS) for the 84Kr(n,{\gamma}) 85Kr and 86Kr(n,{\gamma}) 87Kr processes were examined using the statistical model code Talys v1.96. The effects of nuclear level densities (NLDs) on Maxwellian averaged cross sections and neutron capture rates are examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. The present Talys based MACS and radiative capture rates for 84Kr(n,{\gamma}) 85Kr and 86Kr(n,{\gamma}) 87Kr processes agree well with the earlier reported findings. The statistical models nuclear properties (level density and gamma ray strength) were fine tuned to reproduce the existing experimental nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Generating a highly uniform magnetic field inside the magnetically shielded room of the n2EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coil system designed to generate a highly uniform magnetic field for the n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It consists of a main $B_0$ coil and a set of auxiliary coils mounted on a cubic structure with a side length of 273 cm, inside a large magnetically shielded room (MSR). We have assembled this system and characerized its performances with a mapping robot. The apparatus is able to generate a 1 $\mu$ T vertical field with a relative root mean square deviation $\sigma$ ($B_z$)/$B_z$ = 3 $\times$ $10^{-5}$ over the volume of interest, a cylinder of radius 40 cm and height 30 cm. This level of uniformity overcomes the n2EDM requirements, allowing a measurement of the neutron Electric Dipole Moment with a sensitivity better than 1 $\times$ $10^{-27}$ ecm.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy at NA61/SHINE using symmetric L\'evy sources in central $^{40}$Ar+$^{45}$Sc from 40$A$ GeV/$c$ to 150$A$ GeV/$c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent decades of high energy physics research, it was demonstrated that strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) is created in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Investigation and understanding of properties of the hadronic matter is among the important goals of NA61/SHINE collaboration at CERN SPS. Mapping of the phase diagram is achieved by varying the collision energy (5 GeV $&lt;\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}&lt;$17 GeV) and by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). We report on the measurement of femtoscopic correlations in intermediate system at intermediate SPS energies. Interpreting the results of measurements within the symmetric L\'evy source formalism, we discuss the values of L\'evy source parameters as a function of average pair transverse mass. One of the physical parameters is particularly important, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, which describes the shape of the source and may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$ in the proximity of the critical point. Therefore, measuring it may shed light on the location of the critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Experimental Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental method to directly correlate initial participant asymmetry with final-state multiplicity to quantify contribution of preferential emission to the rapidity-odd component of pseudorapidity distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions. Within a transport model simulation, the correlator displays an increase from mid to large rapidities and from central to peripheral collisions. It also displays sensitivity to spectator dynamics, with its magnitude decreasing as more spectators undergo evaporation or fragmentation. The proposed correlator provides a powerful experimental tool to constrain particle production mechanisms and the space-time evolution of spectator matter in heavy-ion collisions</description>

      <title>Imaging the Wakes of Jets with Energy-Energy-Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the partons in a jet propagate through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in a heavy-ion collision, they lose energy to, kick, and are kicked by the medium. The resulting modifications to the parton shower encode information about the microscopic nature of QGP. The momentum and energy lost by the parton shower are gained by the medium and, since QGP is a strongly coupled liquid, this means that the jet excites a wake in the droplet of QGP. After freezeout, this wake becomes soft hadrons with net momentum in the jet direction meaning that reconstructed jets include hadrons originating from both the modified parton shower and its wake. This makes it challenging to find an unambiguous experimental view of the response of a droplet of QGP to a jet. Recent years have seen significant advances in the understanding of the substructure of jets using correlation functions of the energy flux operator. So far, such studies have focused primarily on the two-point correlator, which serves to identify the angular scale of the underlying dynamics. Higher-point correlators hold the promise of mapping out the dynamics themselves. We perform the first study of the shape-dependent three-point energy-energy-energy correlator in heavy-ion collisions. Using the Hybrid Model to simulate the interactions of high energy jets with QGP, we show that hadrons originating from wakes are the dominant contribution to the three-point correlator in the regime where the three points are well-separated in angle, forming a roughly equilateral triangle. This equilateral region of the correlator is far from the region populated by collinear vacuum emissions, making it a canvas on which jet wakes can be imaged. Our work is a key step towards the systematic use of energy correlators to image and unravel the dynamical response of a droplet of QGP to a passing jet, and motivates many experimental and theoretical studies.</description>
