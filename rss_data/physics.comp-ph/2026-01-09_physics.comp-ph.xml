      <title>A joint voxel flow - phase field framework for ultra-long microstructure evolution prediction with physical regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field (PF) modeling is a powerful tool for simulating microstructure evolution. To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales.</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Low-Dose Simulation for Grating-Based X-Ray Dark-Field Radiography Using a Virtually Decreased Irradiation Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: X-ray dark-field radiography uses small-angle scattering to visualize the structural integrity of lung alveoli. To study the influence of dose reduction on clinical dark-field radiographs, one can simulate low-dose images by virtually reducing the irradiated area. However, these simulations can exhibit stripe artifacts. Purpose: Validation of the low-dose simulation algorithm reported by Schick &amp; Bast et al., PLoS ONE, 2024. Furthermore, we want to demonstrate that stripe artifacts observed in simulated images at very low-dose levels are introduced by limitations of the algorithm and would not appear in actual low-dose dark-field images. Methods: Dark-field radiographs of an anthropomorphic chest phantom were acquired at different tube currents equaling different radiation doses. Based on the measurement with a high radiation dose, dark-field radiographs corresponding to lower radiation doses were simulated by virtually reducing the irradiated area. The simulated low-dose radiographs were evaluated by a quantitative comparison of the dark-field signal using different regions of interests. Results: Dark-field radiographs acquired at one quarter of the standard dose were artifact-free. The dark-field signal differed from the simulated radiographs by up to 10%. Algorithm-induced stripe artifacts decrease the image quality of the simulated radiographs. Conclusions: Virtually reducing the irradiation area is a simple approach to generate low-dose radiographs based on images acquired with scanning-based dark-field radiography. However, as the algorithm creates stripe artifacts in the dark-field images, particularly at higher dose reductions, that are not present in measured low-dose images, simulated images have reduced image quality compared to their measured counterparts.</description>

      <title>Self-Organized Criticality from Protected Mean-Field Dynamics: Loop Stability and Internal Renormalization in Reflective Neural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reflective homeostatic dynamics provides a minimal mechanism for self-organized criticality in neural systems. Starting from a reduced stochastic description, we demonstrate within the MSRJD field-theoretic framework that fluctuation effects do not destabilize the critical manifold. Instead, loop corrections are dynamically regularized by homeostatic curvature, yielding a protected mean-field critical surface that remains marginally stable under coarse-graining. Beyond robustness, we show that response-driven structural adaptation generates intrinsic parameter flows that attract the system toward this surface without external fine tuning. Together, these results unify loop renormalization and adaptive response in a single framework and establish a concrete route to autonomous criticality in reentrant neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>sidmkit: A Reproducible Toolkit for SIDM Phenomenology and Galaxy Rotation-Curve Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is a well-motivated extension of cold dark matter that can modify halo structure on galactic and group scales while remaining consistent with large-scale structure. However, practical SIDM work often requires bridging several layers, including microphysical scattering models, velocity-dependent effective cross sections, phenomenological astrophysical constraints, and (separately) data-driven halo fits, such as rotation curves. In this paper, we describe \texttt{sidmkit}, a transparent and reproducible Python package designed to support SIDM ``micro$\rightarrow$macro'' calculations and to provide a robust batch pipeline for fitting rotation curves in the SPARC data. On the SIDM side, \texttt{sidmkit} implements velocity-dependent momentum-transfer cross sections for a Yukawa interaction using standard analytic approximations (Born, classical, and Hulth\'en-based) with a numerical partial-wave option for spot checks. It also provides consistent velocity-moment averaging for Maxwellian relative speeds, scattering-rate utilities, and curated literature \emph{summary} constraints for regression tests and exploratory scans. On the rotation-curve side, we implement bounded non-linear least squares fits of NFW and Burkert halo models to SPARC baryonic decompositions, with optional mass-to-light priors and information-criterion summaries (AIC/BIC). For the demonstration dataset, we process 191 \texttt{rotmod} galaxies (LTG+ETG bundles) and fit both NFW and Burkert models (382 total fits). We find that Burkert is preferred by $\Delta \mathrm{BIC} &gt; 0$ for $65.4\%$ of galaxies, with ``strong'' preference ($\Delta \mathrm{BIC}&gt;6$) in $32.5\%$ of galaxies;</description>

      <title>Differential syntactic and semantic encoding in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how syntactic and semantic information is encoded in inner layer representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the very large DeepSeek-V3. We find that, by averaging hidden-representation vectors of sentences sharing syntactic structure or meaning, we obtain vectors that capture a significant proportion of the syntactic and semantic information contained in the representations. In particular, subtracting these syntactic and semantic ``centroids'' from sentence vectors strongly affects their similarity with syntactically and semantically matched sentences, respectively, suggesting that syntax and semantics are, at least partially, linearly encoded. We also find that the cross-layer encoding profiles of syntax and semantics are different, and that the two signals can to some extent be decoupled, suggesting differential encoding of these two types of linguistic information in LLM representations.</description>

      <title>PINN-Based Solution for a Diffusion Controlled Droplet Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study diffusion-controlled growth of a spherical droplet with a moving boundary using a physics-informed neural network (PINN) formulation. The governing diffusion equation is coupled to the interfacial mass balance, with the droplet radius treated as an additional trainable function of time. The PINN accurately reproduces the self-similar growth law and concentration profiles for a wide range of initial droplet radii, demonstrating convergence toward the asymptotic diffusive regime. The proposed approach provides a flexible and computationally efficient framework for solving moving-boundary diffusion problems and can be readily extended to include additional physical effects.</description>

      <title>Multigroup Radiation Diffusion on a Moving Mesh: Implementation in RICH and Application to Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</description>

      <title>Quantum Elastic Network Models and their Application to Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are a central computational methodology in materials design for relating atomic composition to mechanical properties. However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscillators. To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al. (PRX, 2023), which offers an exponential advantage when simulating systems of coupled oscillators under some specific conditions and assumptions. Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect. We estimate that an atomistic simulation of a graphene sheet on the centimeter scale, classically requiring hundreds of petabytes of memory and prohibitive runtimes, could be encoded and simulated with as few as $\sim 160$ logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Simulating decoherence of two coupled spins using the generalized cluster correlation expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the coherence of two coupled electron spins interacting with a bath of nuclei using the generalized cluster correlation expansion (gCCE) method. An exchange interaction between the electrons facilitates a family of entangling gates that can be spoiled by nuclear-induced dephasing. Consequently, we study the dephasing of the coherent two-electron system by characterizing the $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ of the two-electron reduced density matrix for various system parameters in the range mimicking magnetic molecules, including magnetic field strength and orientation, exchange interaction strength, distance between the two spins, minimum distance between electron and nuclei and between nuclei, and nuclei density. We find the optimal regime for each parameter in which the coherence time is maximized and provide a physical understanding of it.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of linguistic statistical laws in images via artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a core element of culture, images transform perception into structured representations and undergo evolution similar to natural languages. Given that visual input accounts for 60% of human sensory experience, it is natural to ask whether images follow statistical regularities similar to those in linguistic systems. Guided by symbol-grounding theory, which posits that meaningful symbols originate from perception, we treat images as vision-centric artifacts and employ pre-trained neural networks to model visual processing. By detecting kernel activations and extracting pixels, we obtain text-like units, which reveal that these image-derived representations adhere to statistical laws such as Zipf's, Heaps', and Benford's laws, analogous to linguistic data. Notably, these statistical regularities emerge spontaneously, without the need for explicit symbols or hybrid architectures. Our results indicate that connectionist networks can automatically develop structured, quasi-symbolic units through perceptual processing alone, suggesting that text- and symbol-like properties can naturally emerge from neural networks and providing a novel perspective for interpretation.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels, such as linear viscoelastic models; equations with positive definite kernels, such as partially observed quantum systems; difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how 'interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis, and makes progress on an open question of Abel regarding the solution of integral equations of the first kind. Finally, it reduces simple Volterra equations of all classes to pen-and-paper calculation, and offers promising applications to the numerical solution of Volterra equations more broadly.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. Recent advancements on these topics are presented including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. The scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures is also highlighted. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.</description>

      <title>An effective bath state approach to model infrared spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics in complex molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a molecule contains more than a few atoms, its full-dimensional dynamics becomes untractable, especially when introducing temperature effects. In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath. In this prospect, we extend the effective bath state (EBS) method that we had first developed and benchmarked in [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 044107 (2024)] to describe the spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics of complex isolated molecules. The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. It allows for a significant reduction of the bath dimension and makes finite-temperature calculations more accessible. In order to treat a realistic molecule, the method is extended to include polynomial couplings in the bath coordinates. The ability of the method to model temperature-resolved infrared spectra and to follow population transfers between the vibrational modes of the molecule is first tested on a 10-mode model system. The extended method is then applied to the realistic case of phenylacetylene.</description>

      <title>El Agente Cu\'antico: Automating quantum simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is central to understanding and designing quantum systems across physics and chemistry. Yet it has barriers to access from both computational complexity and computational perspectives, due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space and the complexity of modern software tools. Here we introduce{\cinzel El Agente Cu\'antico}, a multi-agent AI system that automates quantum-simulation workflows by translating natural-language scientific intent into executed and validated computations across heterogeneous quantum-software frameworks. By reasoning directly over library documentation and APIs, our agentic system dynamically assembles end-to-end simulations spanning state preparation, closed- and open-system dynamics, tensor-network methods, quantum control, quantum error correction, and quantum resource estimation. The developed system unifies traditionally distinct simulation paradigms behind a single natural-language interface. Beyond reducing technical barriers, this approach opens a path toward scalable, adaptive, and increasingly autonomous quantum simulation, enabling faster exploration of physical models, rapid hypothesis testing, and closer integration between theory, simulation, and emerging quantum hardware.</description>
