      <title>Probing Dust and Gas Properties Using Ringed Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How rapidly a planet grows in mass and how far they may park from the host star depend sensitively on two non-dimensional parameters: Stokes number St and turbulent $\alpha$. Yet, these parameters remain highly uncertain being difficult or impossible to measure directly. Here, we demonstrate how the ringed disks can be leveraged to obtain St and $\alpha$ separately by constructing a simple toy model that combines dust radial equation of motion under aerodynamic drag and coupling to gas motion with the measured distribution of dust masses in Class 0/I disks. Focusing on known systems with well-resolved dust rings, we find that the range of St and $\alpha$ that are consistent with the measured properties of the rings are small: $10^{-4} \lesssim {\rm St} \lesssim 10^{-2}$ and $10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$. These low St and $\alpha$ ensure the observed rings are stable against clumping. Even in one marginal case where the formation of bound clumps is possible, further mass growth by pebble accretion is inhibited. Furthermore, the derived low $\alpha$ is consistent with the nearly inviscid regime where Type I migration can be prematurely halted. Our analysis predicts minimal planet population beyond $\sim$10s of au where we observe dust rings and significantly more vigorous planet formation inside $\sim$10 AU, consistent with current exo-giant statistics. We close with discussions on the implications of our results on small planet statistics at large orbital distances.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Habitability of Exoplanets: Thriving Under Extreme Environmental Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic nature of life's ability to thrive in diverse and changing planetary environments suggests that habitability and survival depend on the evolutionary path and life adaptation to environmental conditions. Here we explore such "adaptive habitability" through astro-ecological models. We study the interplay between temperature adaptation and environmental fluctuations, particularly those induced by solar activity and orbital dynamics. We present a simplified ecological-evolutionary model to investigate the limits of life's adaptability on a planetary scale. By incorporating complexities such as multiple niches, migration, species interactions, and realistic temperature variations, we demonstrate the potential for adaptive habitability in the face of both gradual and abrupt environmental changes. Through simulations encompassing monotonic, periodic, and secular dynamical evolution-induced temperature profiles, we identify critical thresholds for survival and extinction, highlighting the importance of phenotypic variance and dispersal rates in adapting to varying environmental conditions. These findings underscore the significance of considering temporal variations in assessing exoplanet habitability and expanding the search space for potentially habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: A JWST comparative survey of aligned vs misaligned hot Jupiters to test the dependence of atmospheric composition on migration history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary objective of exoplanet atmosphere characterisation is to learn about planet formation and evolution, however, this is challenged by degeneracies. To determine whether differences in atmospheric composition can be reliably traced to differences in evolution, we are undertaking a new survey with JWST to compare the compositions of a sample of hot Jupiters that orbit F stars above the Kraft break with different orbital alignments. Under the assumption that aligned planets migrate through the inner disc, while misaligned planets migrate after disc dispersal, the act of migrating through the inner disc should lead to a measurable difference in the C/O between aligned and misaligned planets. We expect the amplitude and sign of this difference to depend on the amount of planetesimal accretion and whether silicates accreted from the inner disc release their oxygen. Here, we identify all known exoplanets that are suitable for testing this hypothesis, describe our JWST survey, and use noise simulations and atmospheric retrievals to estimate our survey's sensitivity. With the selected sample of four aligned and four misaligned hot Jupiters, we will be sensitive to the predicted differences in C/O between aligned and misaligned hot Jupiters for a wide range of model scenarios.</description>

      <title>BOWIE-ALIGN: How formation and migration histories of giant planets impact atmospheric compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters present a unique opportunity for measuring how planet formation history shapes present-day atmospheric composition. However, due to the myriad pathways influencing composition, a well-constructed sample of planets is needed to determine whether formation history can be accurately traced back from atmospheric composition. To this end, the BOWIE-ALIGN survey will compare the compositions of 8 hot Jupiters around F stars, 4 with orbits aligned with the stellar rotation axis and 4 misaligned. Using the alignment as an indicator for planets that underwent disc migration or high-eccentricity migration, one can determine whether migration history produces notable differences in composition between the two samples of planets. This paper describes the planet formation model that motivates our observing programme. Our model traces the accretion of chemical components from the gas and dust in the disc over a broad parameter space to create a full, unbiased model sample from which we can estimate the range of final atmospheric compositions. For high metallicity atmospheres (O/H &gt; 10 times solar), the C/O ratios of aligned and misaligned planets diverge, with aligned planets having lower C/O (&lt; 0.25) due to the accretion of oxygen-rich silicates from the inner disc. However, silicates may rain out instead of releasing their oxygen into the atmosphere. This would significantly increase the C/O of aligned planets (C/O &gt; 0.6), inverting the trend between the aligned and misaligned planets. Nevertheless, by comparing statistically significant samples of aligned and misaligned planets, we expect atmospheric composition to constrain how planets form.</description>

      <title>Aligning Planet-Hosting Binaries via Dissipative Precession in Circumstellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have demonstrated that some subset of even moderately wide-separation planet-hosting binaries are preferentially configured such that planetary and binary orbits appear to lie within the same plane. In this work, we explore dissipation during the protoplanetary disk phase, induced by disk warping as the system is forced into nodal recession by an inclined binary companion as a possible avenue of achieving orbit-orbit alignment. We analytically model the coupled evolution of the disk angular momentum vector and stellar spin vector under the influence of a distant binary companion. We find that a population of systems with random initial orientations can appear detectably more aligned after undergoing dissipative precession, and that this process can simultaneously produce an obliquity distribution that is consistent with observations. While dissipative precession proceeds efficiently in close binaries, favorable system properties (e.g., $r_{out} \gtrsim 100$ AU, $\alpha \gtrsim 0.05$, and/or $M_b/M_{*} \gtrsim 1$) are required to reproduce observed alignment trends at wider binary separations $a_\mathrm{b} \gtrsim450$ AU. Our framework further predicts that circum-primary planets in systems with high stellar mass ratios should be preferentially less aligned than planets in equal-mass stellar binary systems. We discover tentative evidence for this trend in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and TESS data. Our findings suggest that dissipative precession may play a significant role in sculpting orbital configurations in a sub-set of moderately-wide planet-hosting binaries, but is likely not solely responsible for their observed population-level alignment.</description>

      <title>Non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamic Instabilities in Protoplanetary Disks: Vertical Modes and Reflection Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetized disk winds and wind-driven accretion are an essential and intensively studied dispersion mechanism of protoplanetary disks. However, the stability of these mechanisms has yet to be adequately examined. This paper employs semi-analytic linear perturbation theories under non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics, focusing on disk models whose magnetic diffusivities vary by a few orders of magnitude from the disk midplane to its surface. Linear modes are distinguished by their symmetry with respect to the midplane. These modes have qualitatively different growth rates: symmetric modes almost always decay, while at least one anti-symmetric mode always has a positive growth rate. This growth rate decreases faster than the Keplerian angular velocity with cylindrical radius $R$ in the disk and scales steeper than $R^{-5/2}$ in the fiducial disk model. The growth of anti-symmetric modes breaks the reflection symmetry across the disk equatorial plane, and may occur even in the absence of the Hall effect. In the disk regions where fully developed anti-symmetric modes occur, accretion flows appear only on one side of the disk, while disk winds occur only on the other. This may explain the asymmetry of some observed protoplanetary-disk outflows.</description>

      <title>Isles of regularity in a sea of chaos amid the gravitational three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-body problem (3BP) poses a longstanding challenge in physics and celestial mechanics. Despite the impossibility of obtaining general analytical solutions, statistical theories have been developed based on the ergodic principle. This assumption is justified by chaos, which is expected to fully mix the accessible phase space of the 3BP. This study probes the presence of regular (i.e. non chaotic) trajectories within the 3BP and assesses their impact on statistical escape theories. Using numerical simulations, we establish criteria for identifying regular trajectories and analyse their impact on statistical outcomes. Our analysis reveals that regular trajectories occupy up to 32% of the phase space, and their outcomes defy the predictions of statistical escape theories. The coexistence of regular and chaotic regions at all scales is characterized by a multi-fractal behaviour. Integration errors manifest as numerical chaos, artificially enhancing the mixing of the phase space and affecting the reliability of individual simulations, yet preserving the statistical correctness of an ensemble of realizations. Our findings underscore the challenges in applying statistical escape theories to astrophysical problems, as they may bias results by excluding the outcome of regular trajectories. This is particularly important in the context of formation scenarios of gravitational wave mergers, where biased estimates of binary eccentricity can significantly impact estimates of coalescence efficiency and detectable eccentricity.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST High Contrast: JWST/NIRCam observations of the young giant planet $\beta$ Pic b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first JWST/NIRCam observations of the directly-imaged gas giant exoplanet $\beta$ Pic b. Observations in six filters using NIRCam's round coronagraphic masks provide a high signal-to-noise detection of $\beta$ Pic b and the archetypal debris disk around $\beta$ Pic over a wavelength range of $\sim$1.7-5 $\mu$m. This paper focuses on the detection of $\beta$ Pic b and other potential point sources in the NIRCam data, following a paper by Rebollido et al. which presented the NIRCam and MIRI view of the debris disk around $\beta$ Pic. We develop and validate approaches for obtaining accurate photometry of planets in the presence of bright, complex circumstellar backgrounds. By simultaneously fitting the planet's PSF and a geometric model for the disk, we obtain planet photometry that is in good agreement with previous measurements from the ground. The NIRCam data supports the cloudy nature of $\beta$ Pic b's atmosphere and the discrepancy between its mass as inferred from evolutionary models and the dynamical mass reported in the literature. We further identify five additional localized sources in the data, but all of them are found to be background stars or galaxies based on their color or spatial extent. We can rule out additional planets in the disk midplane above 1 Jupiter mass outward of 2 arcsec ($\sim$40 au) and away from the disk midplane above 0.05 Jupiter masses outward of 4 arcsec ($\sim$80 au). The inner giant planet $\beta$ Pic c remains undetected behind the coronagraphic masks of NIRCam in our observations.</description>

      <title>Sequential giant planet formation initiated by disc substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet formation models are necessary to understand the origins of diverse planetary systems. Circumstellar disc substructures have been proposed as preferred locations of planet formation but a complete formation scenario has not been covered by a single model so far. We aim to study the formation of giant planets facilitated by disc substructure and starting with sub-micron-sized dust. We connect dust coagulation and drift, planetesimal formation, $N$-body gravity, pebble accretion, planet migration, planetary gas accretion and gap opening in one consistent modelling framework. We find rapid formation of multiple gas giants from the initial disc substructure. The migration trap near the substructure allows the formation of cold gas giants. A new pressure maximum is created at the outer edge of the planetary gap, which triggers the next generation of planet formation resulting in a compact chain of giant planets. A high planet formation efficiency is achieved as the first gas giants are effective in preventing dust from drifting further inwards, which preserves materials for planet formation. Sequential planet formation is a promising framework to explain the formation of chains of gas and ice giants.</description>
