      <title>Assessing Fiscal Policy Effectiveness on Household Savings in Hungary, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic during the COVID-19 Crisis: A Markov Switching VAR Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted household consumption, savings, and income across Europe, particularly affecting countries like Hungary, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic. This study investigates the effectiveness of fiscal policies in mitigating these impacts, focusing on government interventions such as spending, subsidies, revenue, and debt. Utilizing a Markov Switching Vector Auto regression (MS-VAR) model, the study examines data from 2000 to 2023, considering three economic regimes: the initial shock, the peak crisis, and the recovery phase. The results indicate that the COVID-19 shock led to a sharp decline in household consumption and income in all three countries, with Slovenia facing the most severe immediate impact. Hungary, however, showed the strongest recovery, driven by effective fiscal measures such as subsidies and increased government spending, which significantly boosted both household consumption and income. The Czech Republic demonstrated a more gradual recovery, with improvements observed in future-oriented consumption (IMPC). In conclusion, the study underscores the critical role of targeted fiscal interventions in mitigating the adverse effects of crises. The findings suggest that governments should prioritize timely and targeted fiscal policies to support household financial stability during economic downturns and ensure long-term recovery.</description>

      <title>Bridging Retrospective and Prospective Merger Analyses: The Case of US Airline Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We begin with a retrospective analysis of three major U.S. airline mergers and document the sensitivity of the findings, particularly questioning whether market conditions evolve similarly for treated and control markets. We then develop a structural model that clarifies this and other assumptions implicit in retrospective analyses and separates efficiency gains from increases in firms' conduct. Using only pre-merger data, we propose a reduced-form approach that leverages exogenous changes in market structure to forecast merger effects. Finally, we use structural prospective merger simulations with our other estimates for a comprehensive evaluation. This bridging of approaches uncovers a fundamental tension: either efficiency gains were limited or, if they were significant, they were accompanied and offset by coordinated effects.</description>

      <title>The Striking Impact of Natural Hazard Risk on Global Green Hydrogen Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to climate change, natural hazards that affect energy infrastructure will become more frequent in the future. However, to incorporate natural hazard risk into infrastructure investment decisions, we develop an approach to translate this risk into discount rates. Thus, our newly developed discount rate approach incorporates both economic risk and natural hazard risk. To illustrate the impact of including the risk of natural hazards, we apply country-specific discount rates for hydrogen production costs. The country-specific relative difference in hydrogen generation cost ranges from a 96% surplus in the Philippines to a -63% cost reduction in Kyrgyzstan compared to a discount rate that only consists of economic risks. The inclusion of natural hazard risk changes the cost ranking of technologies as outcome of energy system models and thus policy recommendations. The derived discount rates for 254 countries worldwide are published in this publication for further use.</description>

      <title>Income Inequality, Food Aid, and 'Zero Hunger': Evaluating Effectiveness During Lula's Administration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Income inequality has been an important social issue that has attracted widespread attention. Taking the Zero Hunger Program in Brazil as a case study, this study analyzes the impact of policy changes on the income distribution of the Brazilian population during the implementation of the program using a breakpoint regression approach. The data for the study come from a variety of sources, including the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Social Assistance and the Family, and are analyzed using detailed descriptive statistics from the CEIC Brazil In-Depth Database. The results of the study show that during the Lula administration, Brazil's Zero Hunger Program substantially reduced income inequality, provided more substantial income security for the poor, and reduced the income gap between the rich and the poor. In terms of gender differences, the program led to a larger increase in the income of the male labor force at the right age compared to the female labor force, further highlighting the positive impact of the policy on the male labor force. These results are further confirmed by sensitivity analysis and provide useful lessons for subsequent policy formulation. This study's deep dive into the effects of the Zero Hunger program provides a valuable contribution to academic social science research and policy development.</description>

      <title>The Impact Of Industrial Production On Economic Growth: New Empirical Evidence For T\"urkiye In A Material Development Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are different views in the literature regarding economic growth and development. Growth and development hypotheses have been addressed from many different perspectives. It is aimed to examine the view of production with the Heavy Industry Initiative proposed by Prof. Dr. Necmettin Erbakan a crucial part of Material Development in T\"urkiye. In this context, an examination has been conducted on GDP, Mining, Manufacturing, Energy, and Chemical Industry Productions in T\"urkiye between 1995-2023, focusing on percentage changes. The stationarity of our data set has been checked, and a VAR estimation has been performed by determining the lag length. Long-term relationships have been identified through the Johansen Cointegration test, and after confirming that there are no issues of autocorrelation and changing variance, variance decomposition has been carried out. Thus, inferences have been made regarding the effects of the identified sectors on GDP. Based on the analysis results, it has been observed that there is a stronger relationship between GDP and the Manufacturing Sector compared to the Mining, Energy, and Chemical Sectors, and it has been concluded that sectoral shocks diminish over time. Additionally, VAR Impulse-Response Analysis has been conducted among the variables. In this context, it has been observed that the variables in the dataset have an impact on each other in both the short and long term. It has been concluded that the shocks were more pronounced in the initial periods, while the economy reached a balance over time. In this regard, it has been confirmed that the heavy industry initiative exhibited different responses sectorally, while also being significant in terms of economic growth and development.</description>

      <title>Transferable Know-How: Evidence from the Upstream Oil &amp; Gas Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consequences of the adoption of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) on productivity, competition, and further technological adoption in the upstream oil \&amp; gas industry in the North Sea. Exploiting geological heterogeneity and a Norwegian Supreme Court decision that reduced policy uncertainty, we show that early EOR adopters increased their productivity and gained shares of the North Sea market through three channels. First, direct productivity gains due to EOR adoption. Second, specialization by transferring the acquired know-how to other EOR-eligible fields. Third, diversification through know-how-driven economies of scope that facilitated investments in non-EOR-eligible fields requiring alternative technologies.</description>

      <title>Strategic Responses to Technological Change: Evidence from Online Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this project, we examine how freelancers changed their behavior on an online work platform following the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. We first document that, post-ChatGPT, freelancers bid on fewer jobs and reposition themselves by differentiating their distribution of bids relative to their prior behavior. We disentangle heterogeneity in repositioning across work domains by exploring how exposure to changes in supply or demand underlie repositioning. Decreases in the demand for labor post-ChatGPT lead workers to reposition themselves by withdrawing from the focal market/exiting the platform and changing their horizontal positioning (i.e., work domain), while increases in the supply of labor post-ChatGPT are less likely to lead to changes in volume of activity or horizontal positioning but more likely to result decrease the proportion of bids to high-value jobs, perhaps in response to increased competition. We further show that repositioning is less likely when adjustment costs are higher due to greater skill. Our research contributes to our understanding of how and why workers respond to technological change.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to the cloud: Cloud technology use and growth rates in small and large firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence shows that investments in ICT disproportionately improve the performance of larger firms versus smaller ones. However, ICT may not be all alike, as they differ in their impact on firms' organisational structure. We investigate the effect of the use of cloud services on the long run size growth rate of French firms. We find that cloud services positively impact firms' growth rates, with smaller firms experiencing more significant benefits compared to larger firms. Our findings suggest cloud technologies help reduce barriers to digitalisation, which affect especially smaller firms. By lowering these barriers, cloud adoption enhances scalability and unlocks untapped growth potential.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate is an evolving complex system with dynamic interactions and non-linear feedback mechanisms, shaping environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Crop production is highly sensitive to such climatic fluctuations. This paper studies the price volatility of agricultural crops as influenced by meteorological variables (and many other environmental, social and governance factors), which is a critical challenge in sustainable finance, agricultural planning, and policy-making. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states of Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns of crop prices from 2012 to 2024. This study further explores the cross-correlations between volatility and the meteorological variables. Further, a Granger-causality test is carried out to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the price volatility. Finally, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. We believe that this will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</description>
