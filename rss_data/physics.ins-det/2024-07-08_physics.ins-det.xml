      <title>Compact Ion Beam System for Fusion Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a compact ion beam device capable of accelerating H$^+$ and D$^+$ ions up to 75keV energy, on to a solid target, with sufficient beam current to study fusion reactions. The ion beam system uses a microwave driven plasma source to generate ions that are accelerated to high energy with a DC acceleration structure. The plasma source is driven by pulsed microwaves from a solid-state RF amplifier, which is impedance matched to the plasma source chamber at the ISM band frequency (2.4-2.5GHz). The plasma chamber is held at high positive DC potential and is isolated from the impedance matching structure (at ground potential) by a dielectric-filled gap. To facilitate the use of high-energy-particle detectors near the target, the plasma chamber is biased to a high positive voltage, while the target remains grounded. A target loaded with deuterium is used to study D-D fusion and a B$_4$C or LaB$_6$ target is used to study p-$^{11}$B fusion. Detectors include solid-state charged particle detector and a scintillation fast neutron detector. The complete ion beam system can fit on a laboratory table and is a useful tool for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about the physics of fusion.</description>

      <title>Flutter instability in solids and structures, with a view on biomechanics and metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of oscillatory instability called \lq flutter' was observed in aeroelasticity and rotor dynamics about a century ago. Driven by a series of applications involving nonconservative elasticity theory at different physical scales, ranging from nanomechanics to the mechanics of large space structures and including biomechanical problems of motility and growth, research on flutter is experiencing a new renaissance. A review is presented of the most notable applications and recent advances in fundamentals, both theoretical and experimental aspects, of flutter instability and Hopf bifurcation. Open problems, research gaps, and new perspectives for investigations are indicated.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results of the Single Event Effect testing for the ULTRASAT sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ULTRASAT (ULtra-violet TRansient Astronomy SATellite) is a wide-angle space telescope that will perform a deep time-resolved all-sky survey in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectrum. The science objectives are the detection of counterparts to short-lived transient astronomical events such as gravitational wave sources and supernovae. The mission is led by the Weizmann Institute of Science and is planned for launch in 2026 in collaboration with the Israeli Space Agency and NASA. DESY will provide the UV camera, composed by the detector assembly located in the telescope focal plane and the remote electronics unit. The camera is composed out of four back-metallized CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) manufactured in the 4T, dual gain Tower process. As part of the radiation qualification of the camera, Single Event Effect (SEE) testing has been performed by irradiating the sensor with heavy ions at the RADEF, Jyvaskyla facility. Preliminary results of both Single Event Upset (SEU) and Single Event Latch-up (SEL) occurrence rate in the sensor are presented. Additionally, an in-orbit SEE rate simulation has been performed in order to gain preliminary knowledge about the expected effect of SEE on the mission.</description>

      <title>A new possible way to detect Axion Anti-quark Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axion anti-quark nugget (A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$N) model was developed to explain in a natural way the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in Universe. In this hypothesis, a similitude between the dark and the visible components exists. The lack of observability of any type of dark matter up to now, in particular A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$Ns, requires finding new ways of detecting these particles, if they exist. In spite of strong interaction with visible matter, for such objects a very small ratio of cross section to mass is expected and thus huge detector systems are necessary. This paper presents a new idea for the direct detection of the A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$Ns using minerals as natural rock deposits acting as paleo-detectors, where the latent signals of luminescence produced by interactions of A$\bar{\mathrm{Q}}$Ns are registered and can be identified as an increased and symmetrical deposited dose. The estimates were made for minerals widely distributed on Earth, for which the TL signal is intense and if the thermal conditions are constant and with low temperatures, the lifetime of the latent signals is kept for geological time scales.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Multi-Event Reconstruction for Delay Line Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate observation of two or more particles within a very narrow time window has always been a challenge in modern physics. It creates the possibility of correlation experiments, such as the ground-breaking Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment, leading to new physical insights. For low-energy electrons, one possibility is to use a microchannel plate with subsequent delay lines for the readout of the incident particle hits, a setup called a Delay Line Detector. The spatial and temporal coordinates of more than one particle can be fully reconstructed outside a region called the dead radius. For interesting events, where two electrons are close in space and time, the determination of the individual positions of the electrons requires elaborate peak finding algorithms. While classical methods work well with single particle hits, they fail to identify and reconstruct events caused by multiple nearby particles. To address this challenge, we present a new spatiotemporal machine learning model to identify and reconstruct the position and time of such multi-hit particle signals. This model achieves a much better resolution for nearby particle hits compared to the classical approach, removing some of the artifacts and reducing the dead radius by half. We show that machine learning models can be effective in improving the spatiotemporal performance of delay line detectors.</description>

      <title>COME: Cylindrical oriented muon emission in GEANT4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a source scheme based on source biasing as well as discrete energy spectrum in the cylindrical geometry is presented for the simulations of muon tomography in the GEANT4 toolkit. First, a lateral cylindrical surface and a top circular disc act as a generation surface that surrounds the tomographic setup. Then, the generated muons are directed towards the origin where the target volume is situated. Secondly, the kinetic energy of the entering muons is assigned by using a 80-bin discrete energy spectrum between 0 and 8 GeV that is extracted from the CRY muon generator. Thus, the present recipe is called cylindrical oriented muon emission (COME). This source scheme may especially find its applications in the cases where the lateral muon detectors are utilized in order to profit from the horizontal or horizontal-like muons.</description>

      <title>The Design and Technology Development of the JUNO Central Detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a large scale neutrino experiment with multiple physics goals including deter mining the neutrino mass hierarchy, the accurate measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters, the neutrino detection from the super nova, the Sun, and the Earth, etc. JUNO puts forward physically and technologically stringent requirements for its central detector (CD), including a large volume and target mass (20 kt liquid scintillator, LS), a high energy resolution (3% at 1 MeV), a high light transmittance, the largest possible photomultiplier (PMT) coverage, the lowest possible radioactive background, etc. The CD design, using a spherical acrylic vessel with a diameter of 35.4 m to contain the LS and a stainless steel structure to support the acrylic vessel and PMTs, was chosen and optimized. The acrylic vessel and the stainless steel structure will be immersed in pure water to shield the radioactive back ground and bear great buoyancy. The challenging requirements of the acrylic sphere have been achieved, such as a low intrinsic radioactivity and high transmittance of the manufactured acrylic panels, the tensile and compressive acrylic node design with embedded stainless steel pad, one-time polymerization for multiple bonding lines. Moreover, several technical challenges of the stainless steel structure have been solved: the production of low radioactivity stainless steel material, the deformation and precision control during production and assembly, the usage of high strength stainless steel rivet bolt and of high friction efficient linkage plate. Finally, the design of the ancillary equipment like the LS filling, overflowing and circulating system was done.</description>

      <title>Performance of a coarsely pixelated LAPPD photosensor for the SoLID gas Cherenkov detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SoLID spectrometer's gas Cherenkov counters require photosensors that operate in a high luminosity and high background environment. The reference design features arrays of 9 or 16 tiled multi-anode photomultipliers (MaPMTs), distributed across 32 sectors, to serve the light-gas and heavy-gas Cherenkov counters, respectively. To assess the viability of a pixelated INCOM Large Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD$^{\rm TM}$) as an alternative photosensor to replace MaPMT arrays in either detector, we evaluated its performance under realistic SoLID running conditions in Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).
  The results of this test confirmed that the coarse-pixelated (2.5$\times$2.5 cm$^2$ pixel size) LAPPD is capable of handling the total projected signal and background rates of the three pillar SoLID experiments. The tested photosensor detected Cherenkov signals with the capability of separating single-electron events from pair production events while rejecting background. Although the design was not aimed at ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors, Cherenkov disk images were captured in two different gas radiators. Through a direct comparison with a GEANT4 simulation, we confirmed the experimental performance of the LAPPD.</description>

      <title>Systematic approach to measure the performance of microchannel-plate photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to systematically measure numerous performance parameters of MCP-PMTs. The experimental setups, the analyses and selected results are discussed. Although the techniques used may be different in other locations, the document is intended as a guide for comparable measurements with other types of MCP-PMTs. Measurements are shown for the following performance parameters: spectral and spatial quantum efficiency, collection efficiency, gain as a function of voltage, position and magnetic field, time resolution, rate capability and lifetime. By using a dedicated 3-axis stepper and an FPGA-based DAQ system, also inner PMT parameters are measured as a function of the active area, such as relative detection efficiency, dark count rate, time resolution, recoil electron and afterpulse distributions, as well as charge sharing and electronic crosstalk. In addition, some of the parameters are investigated inside a strong magnetic field. For many of these measurements, the change of most setup parameters and the subsequent analysis can be controlled semi-automatically by software scripts.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of a Magnetic Bottle Electron Spectrometer for High-Energy Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the design and performance of a magnetic bottle electron spectrometer~(MBES) for high-energy electron spectroscopy.
  Our design features a ${\sim2}$~m long electron drift tube and electrostatic retardation lens, achieving sub-electronvolt (eV) electron kinetic energy resolution for high energy (several hundred eV) electrons with close to 4$\pi$ collection efficiency.
  A segmented anode electron detector enables the simultaneous collection of photoelectron spectra in high resolution and high collection efficiency modes.
  This versatile instrument is installed at the TMO endstation at the LCLS x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL).
  In this paper, we demonstrate its high resolution, collection efficiency and spatial selectivity in measurements where it is coupled to an XFEL source.
  These combined characteristics are designed to enable high-resolution time-resolved measurements using x-ray photoelectron, absorption, and Auger-Meitner spectroscopy.
  We also describe the pervasive artifact in MBES time-of-flight spectra that arises from a periodic modulation in electron detection efficiency, and present a robust analysis procedure for its removal.</description>

      <title>Projected WIMP sensitivity of the CDEX-50 dark matter experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CDEX-50 is a next-generation project of the China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) that aims to search for dark matter using a 50-kg germanium detector array. This paper comprises a thorough summary of the CDEX-50 dark matter experiment, including an investigation of potential background sources and the development of a background model. Based on the baseline model, the projected sensitivity of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) is also presented. The expected background level within the energy region of interest, set to 2--2.5 keVee, is $\sim$0.01 counts keVee$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$. At 90\% confidence level, the expected sensitivity to spin-independent WIMP-nucleon couplings is estimated to reach a cross-section of 5.1 $\times$ 10$^{-45}$ cm$^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of 5 GeV/c$^{2}$ with an exposure objective of 150 kg$\cdot$year and an analysis threshold of 160 eVee. This science goal will correspond to the most sensitive results for WIMPs with a mass of 2.2--8 GeV/c$^{2}$.</description>

Abstract: Three machine learning models are used to perform jet origin classification. These models are optimized for deployment on a field-programmable gate array device. In this context, we demonstrate how latency and resource consumption scale with the input size and choice of algorithm. Moreover, the models proposed here are designed to work on the type of data and under the foreseen conditions at the CERN LHC during its high-luminosity phase. Through quantization-aware training and efficient synthetization for a specific field programmable gate array, we show that $O(100)$ ns inference of complex architectures such as Deep Sets and Interaction Networks is feasible at a relatively low computational resource cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high energy physics experiments, the numerical estimation of primary ionization is crucial. An advance study on primary ionization can help in minimizing the effects such as electrical discharges that can damage the gaseous detectors used in high energy physics experiments. The simulation of primary ionization of electrons and positrons with the noble gases using the geant4 toolkit have been presented. The obtained primaries have been separated from secondaries as the later contribute towards electrical discharges and further damage the detectors. The xenon gas shows highest primary ionization among the noble gases.</description>
