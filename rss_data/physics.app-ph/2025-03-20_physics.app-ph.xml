      <title>Ultrawhite structural starch film for sustainable cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing human reliance on high-electricity-consuming cooling technologies like air conditioning is crucial for reshaping the global energy paradigm. Through utilizing natural starch gelatinization, freezedrying and densification processes, we fabricated an ultrawhite cooling starch film with an ultrahigh solar reflectance of 0.96 and strong infrared emittance of 0.94. The porous structure of the cooling starch film, systematically controlled by the mechanical pressing processing, allows for effective scattering of solar radiation while emitting strongly during the atmospheric transparency window, thereby contributing to high-efficiency daytime radiative cooling capacity. Furthermore, the cooling starch film exhibits excellent mechanical tensile strength, measuring at up to 38.5 megapascals, which is more than twice the strength of natural wood. The ultrawhite radiative cooling starch film holds significant promise for optimizing cooling energy usage, especially in hot and arid climates.</description>

      <title>Symmetry violation-driven hysteresis loops as measurands for noise-resilient sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sublinear resonant deviations from an exceptional point degeneracy (EPD) has been recently promoted as a sensing scheme. However, there is still an ongoing debate whether the sensitivity advantage is negated by an increase in fundamental noise - especially when active elements induce self-oscillations. In this case, nonlinearities are crucial in stabilizing amplifying modes and mitigating noise effects. A drawback is the formation of hysteresis loops that signal a transition to unstable modes. This can only be alleviated by precise cavity symmetry management. Here, utilizing two coupled nonlinear RLC tanks with balanced amplification and attenuation, we demonstrate that an explicit symmetry violation, induced by sweeping the resonant detuning of the RLC tanks, reveals a hysteresis loop near the EPD whose width scales sublinearly with the inter-tank coupling. Our proposal re-envisions this disadvantageous feature as a sensing protocol with diverging sensitivity, enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, and self-calibration without requiring delicate symmetry control. As such, it opens new avenues in metrology as well as for optical or RF switching and triggering.</description>

      <title>Transfer ABCD Matrix for Time-Varying Media and Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a formal definition of the transfer ABCD parameters in time-varying electromagnetic systems. The formal definition comes after the rearrangement of the fields $D$ and $B$ at the inputs and outputs of the temporal system based on the time-varying boundary conditions. Then, we derive the ABCD parameters of a temporal transmission line, i.e., a temporal slab, and compute the associated scattering parameters (reflection and transmission coefficients). The results presented here open up an alternative way, based on network theory, to analyze multilayer temporal configurations. Moreover, we show that the ABCD parameters can be used to compute the dispersion diagram ($\omega$ vs $k$) of time crystals.</description>

      <title>Detection and Ranging Beyond the Canonical Resolution Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical range resolution limit in radar, sonar, and lidar systems is found to be a special case of a more general resolution limit. The general limit indicates that it is possible to surpass the canonical limit in moderate (of order unity) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments by using the signal amplitude and phase information. The canonical limit only considers the bandwidth of the received signal without considering how SNR affects the range resolution. Details present in the signal amplitude, such as attenuation and geometric spreading, can act as additional sources of range information. Previous studies have taken advantage of the relationship between target distance and signal amplitude or phase to achieve higher resolution ranging, and often employ unusual transmit waveforms for this purpose. These methods each provide distinct bounds on range resolution, rather than a unified bound applicable across different systems and applications. We apply ideas from information theory to determine a general lower bound to the smallest resolvable range bin size and corresponding target strength measurements.</description>

      <title>Perfectly harmonic spin cycloid and multi-$Q$ textures in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question concerns how topological electronic states are influenced by many-body correlations, and magnetic Weyl semimetals represent an important material platform to address this problem. However, the magnetic structures realized in these materials are limited, and in particular, no clear example of an undistorted helimagnetic state has been definitively identified. Here, we report clear evidence of a harmonic helimagnetic cycloid with an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector in the Weyl semimetal GdAlSi via resonant elastic X-ray scattering, including rigorous polarization analysis. This cycloidal structure is consistent with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction prescribed by the polar crystal structure of GdAlSi. Upon applying a magnetic field, the cycloid undergoes a transition to a novel multi-$Q$ state. This field-induced, noncoplanar texture is consistent with our numerical spin model, which incorporates the DM interaction and, crucially, anisotropic exchange. The perfectly harmonic Weyl helimagnet GdAlSi serves as a prototypical platform to study electronic correlation effects in periodically modulated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Parametric metasurfaces for amplified up-conversion of electromagnetic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal metasurfaces, characterized by dynamic variations in both space and time, enable functionalities unattainable with passive metasurfaces. In this study, we propose a novel concept of parametric metasurfaces capable of performing frequency up-conversion and amplification of free-space electromagnetic waves. This functionality is realized through the modulation of variable capacitances embedded in specially designed dual split-ring resonators. We explore various combinations of the pump and incident wave frequencies and investigate different operational regimes of the proposed parametric system. Our theoretical analysis reveals high up-conversion efficiency, with amplification levels exceeding 20 dB through a cascaded process, surpassing the limits set by the Manley-Rowe relations. Moreover, precise control over the phase of the up-converted waves is achieved by tuning the pump phase, paving the way for advanced manipulation of electromagnetic waves. This approach is applicable in the microwave and subterahertz ranges, with potential scalability to higher frequencies through ultrafast modulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Skyrmionic SU(6) structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological quasi-particles characterised by local spin textures, which are considered to be robust against structural deformation. N\'eel and Bloch states are famous examples of skyrmions, which exhibit radical and chiral spin profiles, respectively. Here, we show a skyrmion can be continuously transformed to an antiskyrmion or various other forms of skymions through underlying symmetry of special unitary group of degree six, SU(6), for photons with spin and orbital angular momentum. We employ a Lie group theory for coherent photons to describe the SU(6) transformation and establish a relationship between the generator of rotation and its expectation values on a hypersphere of $\mathbb{S}^{35}$. We propose a simple experimental setup to control the SU(6) states in combinations with wave-plates and vortex lenses to realise the generalised Euler's formula physically in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We show skyrmionic states are described on higher-order Poincar'e spheres together with a recently proposed skyrmionic torus.</description>

      <title>Effect of Gd and Co content on electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloys: a combined experimental and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of Gd and Co substitutions on the electrochemical and electronic properties of La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ alloy. Two series of La$_{1.5-x}$Gd$_x$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ ($x$ = 0.0, 0.25, 1.0) and La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_{7-y}$Co$_y$ ($y$ = 0.0, 0.5, 1.5) alloys are produced using mechanical alloying technique. The X-ray diffraction indicates multiphase character of the samples, with the majority of hexagonal Ce$_2$Ni$_7$-type and rhombohedral Gd$_2$Co$_7$-type structures of (La,Mg)$_2$Ni$_7$ phase. Partial substitutions of La by Gd or Ni by Co in La$_{1.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Ni$_7$ phase result in increase of cycle stability of the metal hydride (MH$_x$) electrodes. All considered alloys reach the maximum discharge capacity after three charging-discharging cycles. Two optimal compositions, in respect of electrochemical properties, are subsequently investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental analysis of the valence band is further extended by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We also discuss the effects of alloying and site preference of dopants on the position of the van Hove-type singularity, as observed in the electronic densities of states (DOS) in proximity of the Fermi level.</description>

Abstract: High-pressure induced structural transition from zircon-type phase into scheelite-type phase in YVO$_4$ is studied using ab initio calculations. Several structures with compressed volumes are evaluated, where for every considered volume the c/a ratio and atomic positions are optimised. The transition pressure and transition volume change are calculated. The reports on YVO$_4$ electronic structure and electronic band gap behaviour are followed by results of X-Ray photoemission spectra XPS calculations. Most of our theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results taken from literature.</description>

      <title>Determination of Electron Extraction in Semiconductor Photoanodes: Steady-state and Small-perturbation Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops an analytical model to consistently interpret the steady-state and small-perturbation response (both in the time and frequency domain) of photoanodes for solar water-splitting. In addition to accounting for the fundamental mechanisms of charge-carrier generation, recombination and slow hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, the model overcomes the key shortcomings of existing models in the literature. These include consistency across measurements/bias conditions and the non-consideration of imperfect electron extraction at the collecting contact and its corresponding effect on the recombination rate in the bulk. We applied the model to analyse the time constants obtained from intensity-modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and photovoltage (IMVS) measurements of a hematite photoanode, obtaining an electron extraction velocity of 100 cm/s close to the 1 sun open-circuit potential, that corresponds to an electron mobility of 0.022 cm2V-1s-1. The model further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic voltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the literature in the case of hematite photoanodes. The generality of the model allows its extension to other photoanodes and photovoltaic systems, by the addition or removal of specific physical mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confined to small regions, quantum systems exhibit electronic and structural properties different from their free space behavior. In Coulomb 3-body problems, configurations of close proximity of identically charged particles are classically unstable. They however exist as excited quantum states in confined systems. Quantum control of such states might be useful to induce nuclear fusion. The difficult nature of the quantum control of these {\it % quantum collision states} is discussed here, as well as a possible solution using a two-step nonunitary evolution process.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources, as it governs exciton preparation, decay dynamics, and the spectral diffusion of emitted photons. While phonon-assisted excitation has shown promise in other quantum emitter platforms, its proper implementation and systematic comparison with alternative excitation schemes have not yet been demonstrated in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum emitters. Here, we investigate the impact of various optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission properties of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Based on our theoretical predictions for the exciton preparation fidelity, we compare excitation via the longitudinal acoustic and breathing phonon modes to conventional above-band and near-resonance excitations. Under acoustic phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow single-photon emission with a reduced spectral diffusion of 0.0129 nm, a 1.8-fold improvement over above-band excitation. Additionally, excitation through breathing-phonon mode yields a high purity of $ 0.947\pm 0.079\,$ and reduces the decay time by over an order of magnitude, reaching $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the crucial role of phonon-assisted excitation in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters, providing valuable insights for the development of single-photon sources for quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Local bifurcation analysis of circular von-K\'arm\'an plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry based reduction is applied to the buckling of a circular von-Karman plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary, where a mismatch between the edge length and the perimeter of plate is treated as the bifurcation parameter. A nonlinear operator formulation describes the equilibrium of the elastic rod plate system. The critical points, as potential bifurcation points, are stated using the linearized operator. The symmetry of null space for each critical point is identified as a subgroup of the complete symmetry group of nonlinear problem, the equivariance associated with the nonlinear operator is used in this process. Sufficient evidence is provided for each critical point to be a bifurcation point for the symmetry reduced problem and post buckling analysis is carried out using Lyapunov Schmidt reduction. Bifurcation curves are obtained till quadratic order in bifurcation parameter away from each critical value. Theoretical results for bifurcation curves are validated against the numerical simulation based on a symmetry reduced finite element method for some illustrative examples of critical points. A numerical study is carried out for the dependence of the coefficient of quadratic term in the bifurcation parameter when structural parameters are varied in a neighborhood of four fixed sets of structural parameters. Numerical results based on a symmetry reduced finite element analysis confirm that the nonlinear solution agrees with the local theoretical behavior close to a critical point but deviates further away from it. Using these tools, two main conclusions are reached. First it is observed that the critical points of the linearized problem are indeed bifurcation points. Second, an alteration in the nature of bifurcation is observed during the parameter sweep study when the plate is in tension.</description>
