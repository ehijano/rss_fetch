      <title>CNN-BiLSTM for sustainable and non-invasive COVID-19 detection via salivary ATR-FTIR spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare systems and remains a global health concern, especially with the emergence of new variants. Although real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 detection, it is expensive, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sensitive to issues with RNA extraction. In this context, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis of biofluids offers a reagent-free, cost-effective alternative for COVID-19 detection. We propose a novel architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks, referred to as CNN-BiLSTM, to process spectra generated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and diagnose COVID-19 from spectral samples. We compare the performance of this architecture against a standalone CNN and other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms all other models, achieving an average accuracy and F1-score of 0.80 on a challenging real-world COVID-19 dataset. The addition of the BiLSTM layer to the CNN architecture significantly enhances model performance, making CNN-BiLSTM a more accurate and reliable choice for detecting COVID-19 using ATR-FTIR spectra of non-invasive saliva samples.</description>

      <title>Online Dose Verification in VHEE Radiotherapy Using Bremsstrahlung Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very high energy electrons (VHEE) in the 50-250 MeV range, delivered in short pulses at ultra-high dose rates, are proposed for clinical FLASH radiotherapy (RT) targeting deep-seated tumors. The clinical implementation of VHEE-FLASH RT requires online verification to optimize dose delivery. In this study we propose a novel online dose verification technique based on the detection of bremsstrahlung photons during VHEE interactions with matter. A polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) phantom was simulated to evaluate the dose deposited by a VHEE beam and to optimise the system design to detect the bremsstralung radiation. Experimental validation was performed at the Beam Test Facility at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (Isituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare-INFN). A deep learning pipeline was developed to reconstruct the dose distribution in the phantom based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile. Experimental results demonstrated successful detection of bremsstrahlung radiation emitted orthogonally to the beam axis. The deep learning model achieved accurate dose reconstruction based on the bremsstrahlung radiation profile with a discrepancy of less than 2 percent compared to the simulated dose distribution. This study confirms that bremsstrahlung detection provides a viable online verification for VHEE RT.</description>

      <title>Volumetric ultrasound imaging with a sparse matrix array and integrated fiber-optic sensing for robust needle tracking in interventional procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. This proof-of-concept system enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and 3D needle tip tracking, with strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures.</description>
