      <title>What Benefits Drive Membership in Medicare Advantage Plans?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We seek to identify the most relevant benefits offered by Medicare Advantage Health Plans that drive membership and market share. As an example, we explore plans operating in a single county in New Jersey between 2018 and 2023. A dataset of benefits from publicly available data sources was created and the variance inflation factor was applied to identify the correlation between the extracted features, to avoid multicollinearity and overparameterization problems. We categorized the variable Market Share and used it as a multinomial response variable with three categories: less than 0.3\%, 0.3\% to 1.5\%, and over 1.5\%. Categories were chosen to achieve approximately uniform distribution of plans (47, 60, and 65 respectively). We built a multinomial Lasso model using 5-fold cross-validation to tune the penalty parameter. Lasso forced some features to be dropped from the model, which reduces the risk of overfitting and increases the interpretability of the results. For each category, important variables are different. Certain brands drive market share, as do PPO plans and prescription drug coverage. Benefits, particularly ancillary benefits that are not part of CMS's required benefits, appear to have little influence, while financial terms such as deductibles, copays, and out-of-pocket limits are associated with higher market share. Finally, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of the Lasso model with the test set. The accuracy is 0.76.</description>

      <title>Generative Agents and Expectations: Do LLMs Align with Heterogeneous Agent Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results in the Heterogeneous Agent Model (HAM) literature determine the proportion of fundamentalists and trend followers in the financial market. This proportion varies according to the periods analyzed. In this paper, we use a large language model (LLM) to construct a generative agent (GA) that determines the probability of adopting one of the two strategies based on current information. The probabilities of strategy adoption are compared with those in the HAM literature for the S\&amp;P 500 index between 1990 and 2020. Our findings suggest that the resulting artificial intelligence (AI) expectations align with those reported in the HAM literature. At the same time, extending the analysis to artificial market data helps us to filter the decision-making process of the AI agent. In the artificial market, results confirm the heterogeneity in expectations but reveal systematic asymmetry toward the fundamentalist behavior.</description>

      <title>The effects of International Monetary Fund programs: a systematic review with narrative synthesis on poverty, inequality, and social indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This systematic review with narrative synthesis examines the social impacts of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programs. We systematically searched five academic databases and grey literature following PRISMA guidelines and included 53 empirical studies that met predefined eligibility criteria. For each study we assessed risk of bias, with particular attention to how endogeneity, selection bias, and confounding were handled. Because of substantial heterogeneity in outcomes and research designs, results were synthesized narratively rather than through meta analysis. We find that a minority of studies, often using methods with higher risk of bias such as propensity score matching, report no systematic adverse social effects. By contrast, a large body of work using stronger quasi experimental designs, especially instrumental variable strategies, links IMF conditionality to higher income inequality, worse health outcomes (notably tuberculosis and child mortality), and growth of the informal economy. Overall, the best available evidence indicates that IMF programs, particularly those centered on fiscal austerity and structural reforms, impose significant social costs and that a redesign of conditionality is needed to protect social spending and advance the Sustainable Development Goals.</description>

      <title>Pattern Recognition of Scrap Plastic Misclassification in Global Trade Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretable machine learning framework to help identify trade data discrepancies that are challenging to detect with traditional methods. Our system analyzes trade data to find a novel inverse price-volume signature, a pattern where reported volumes increase as average unit prices decrease.
  The model achieves 0.9375 accuracy and was validated by comparing large-scale UN data with detailed firm-level data, confirming that the risk signatures are consistent. This scalable tool provides customs authorities with a transparent, data-driven method to shift from conventional to priority-based inspection protocols, translating complex data into actionable intelligence to support international environmental policies.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Based Equilibrium Analysis of Energy Imbalance Reserve in Day-Ahead Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy imbalance reserve (EIR) product is introduced into the Independent System Operator (ISO) of New England's day-ahead wholesale electricity market to provide a better fuel procurement incentive for generating resources. Different from existing forward reserve products, EIR is a novel real option product, which is settled against real-time energy price rather than reserve prices. This novel product has not been analyzed in the research literature in terms of its effects. In this paper, we develop a stochastic long-run equilibrium model that incorporates the risk preference of generator and demand agents participating in the energy and reserve market in both day-ahead and real-time time frame. In a risk neutral environment, we find that the presence of the EIR product makes little difference on market outcomes. We also conduct a series of numerical simulations with risk-averse generators and demand, and observed increased advanced fuel procurement when the EIR product is present.</description>

      <title>Making Talk Cheap: Generative AI and Labor Market Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have significantly lowered the cost of producing written content. This paper studies how LLMs, through lowering writing costs, disrupt markets that traditionally relied on writing as a costly signal of quality (e.g., job applications, college essays). Using data from Freelancer.com, a major digital labor platform, we explore the effects of LLMs' disruption of labor market signaling on equilibrium market outcomes. We develop a novel LLM-based measure to quantify the extent to which an application is tailored to a given job posting. Taking the measure to the data, we find that employers have a high willingness to pay for workers with more customized applications in the period before LLMs are introduced, but not after. To isolate and quantify the effect of LLMs' disruption of signaling on equilibrium outcomes, we develop and estimate a structural model of labor market signaling, in which workers invest costly effort to produce noisy signals that predict their ability in equilibrium. We use the estimated model to simulate a counterfactual equilibrium in which LLMs render written applications useless in signaling workers' ability. Without costly signaling, employers are less able to identify high-ability workers, causing the market to become significantly less meritocratic: compared to the pre-LLM equilibrium, workers in the top quintile of the ability distribution are hired 19% less often, workers in the bottom quintile are hired 14% more often.</description>

      <title>Not-so-Cleansing Recessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recessions are periods in which the least productive firms in the economy exit, and as the economy recovers, they are replaced by new and more productive entrants. These cleansing effects improve the average firm productivity. At the same time, recessions induce a loss of varieties. We show that the long-run welfare effects trade off these two forces. This trade-off is governed by love-of-variety and the elasticity of substitution in aggregate production. If industry output is aggregated with the standard CES aggregator, recessions do not bring about any improvement in GDP and welfare. If the economy features more love-of-variety than CES, the social planner optimally subsidizes economic activity both in steady state and even more so in recessions to avoid firm exit. We use the model and quasi-exogenous variation in demand to estimate love-of-variety. We find it to be significantly higher than implied by CES aggregation, suggesting that even the long-run effects of recessions are negative. Finally, we quantitatively characterize the optimal policy response both along the transition and in the steady state.</description>

      <title>Self-Selection, University Courses and Returns to Advanced Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher education often requires choosing a bachelor's and a master's degree, yet the returns of these combined choices and the role of courses in different disciplines remain understudied. This paper addresses this gap using detailed data on Italian graduates and university programs. I study the labor market returns to combinations of bachelor's and master's degrees and investigate how curriculum characteristics affect outcomes. I exploit exogenous variation in access to bachelor's and master's degrees to causally estimate the returns to 43 combinations of degrees. I organize the data in a nested model with exogenous variation in admission requirements and explore the preference profile of the sample through policy simulations that shift these requirements. I then relate the estimated returns to the academic curriculum of degrees, focusing on the role of quantitative education and timing of courses. I contribute to the literature on returns to advanced degrees by incorporating master's degrees in the discussion on how higher education affects outcomes and providing evidence on the characteristics of curricula that are positively related to labor market returns. The findings reveal substantial variation in returns to degree combinations, even among combinations with the same bachelor's degree, indicating the need to consider both types of programs. Combinations of degrees in different disciplines positively impact economic outcomes, while those in the same field perform worse. Successful combinations feature more non-quantitative education in the bachelor's, and quantitative courses alone do not explain higher returns.</description>

      <title>Slaying the Dragon: The Quest for Democracy in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter explores how Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), a novel institutional form based on blockchain technology, challenge traditional centralized governance structures. DAOs govern projects ranging from finance to science and digital communities. They aim to redistribute decision-making power through programmable, transparent, and participatory mechanisms. This chapter outlines both the opportunities DAOs present, such as incentive alignment, rapid coordination, and censorship resistance, and the challenges they face, including token concentration, low participation, and the risk of de facto centralization. It further discusses the emerging intersection of DAOs and artificial intelligence, highlighting the potential for increased automation alongside the dangers of diminished human oversight and algorithmic opacity. Ultimately, we discuss under what circumstances DAOs can fulfill their democratic promise or risk replicating the very power asymmetries they seek to overcome.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.</description>

      <title>The Power of Linear Programming in Sponsored Listings Ranking: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sponsored product advertisements constitute a major revenue source for online marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, and Alibaba. A key operational challenge in these systems lies in the Sponsored Listings Ranking (SLR) problem, that is, determining which items to include and how to rank them to balance short-term revenue with long-term relevance and user experience. Industry practice predominantly relies on score-based algorithms, which construct heuristic composite scores to rank items efficiently within strict real-time latency constraints. However, such methods offer limited control over objective trade-offs and cannot readily accommodate additional operational constraints. We propose and evaluate a Linear Programming (LP)-based algorithm as a principled alternative to score-based approaches. We first formulate the SLR problem as a constrained mixed integer programming (MIP) model and develop a dual-based algorithm that approximately solves its LP relaxation within 0.1 second, satisfying production-level latency requirements. In collaboration with a leading online marketplace, we conduct a 19-day field experiment encompassing approximately 329 million impressions. The LP-based algorithm significantly outperforms the industry-standard benchmark in key marketplace metrics, demonstrating both higher revenue and maintained relevance. Mechanism analyses reveal that the performance gains are most pronounced when the revenue-relevance tradeoff is stronger. Our framework also generalizes to settings with inventory, sales, or fairness constraints, offering a flexible and deployable optimization paradigm. The LP-based algorithm was deployed in production at our partner marketplace in January 2023, marking a rare large-scale implementation of a mathematically grounded ranking algorithm in real-world online advertising.</description>

      <title>The Network Effects of the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism with a Quantitative Trade Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the economic and environmental impacts of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) using a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model with input-output linkages adapted from Caliendo, Parro, and Tsyvinski, 2022. We quantify the general equilibrium responses of trade flows, expenditures, and emissions. To our knowledge, we are the first to endogenize both carbon prices and the CBAM price. We find that, when CBAM is at full force, it could contribute to reducing carbon emissions by 5.19%, a rate that could have been higher (-8.84%) without the moderating role of global production networks. As a consequence of CBAM, we observe substitution effects towards non-targeted carbon-intensive inputs located upstream in the supply network. Notably, CBAM marginally increases EU Gross National Expenditure (GNE) due to changes in the terms of trade, and it shifts sourcing towards domestic and environmentally cleaner inputs. In contrast, extra-EU countries experience only a slight decline in GNE (-0.02%) and emissions (-0.11%). Finally, we propose counterfactual exercises that show the relative importance of technological progress on economic integration in global supply networks. Nonetheless, we argue that supply-chain-wise policies are useful for capturing the full carbon footprint in production.</description>

      <title>Signaling in the Age of AI: Evidence from Cover Letters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of generative AI on labor market signaling using the introduction of an AI-powered cover letter writing tool on a large online labor platform. Our data track both access to the tool and usage at the application level. Difference-in-differences estimates show that access to the tool increased textual alignment between cover letters and job posts and raised callback rates. Time spent editing AI-generated cover letter drafts is positively correlated with hiring success. After the tool's introduction, the correlation between cover letters' textual alignment and callbacks fell by 51%, consistent with what theory predicts if the AI technology reduces the signal content of cover letters. In response, employers shifted toward alternative signals, including workers' prior work histories.</description>

      <title>Gas supply shocks, uncertainty and price setting: evidences from Italian firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how natural gas supply shocks affect Italian firms' pricing decisions and inflation expectations using quarterly survey data from the Bank of Italy's Survey on Inflation and Growth Expectations (SIGE). We identify natural gas supply shocks through an external IV-VAR approach exploiting likely unexpected news about interruption to gas supplies to Europe. Our findings show that although gas supply shocks do not have huge effects on gas quantity and only modest effect on gas inventories, they are quickly transmitted to spot electricity prices with persistent effects. We then estimate a proxy internalizing BVAR incorporating firm-level variables from SIGE, documenting that gas supply shocks raise firms' current and expected prices as well as inflation uncertainty. Finally, we uncover substantial nonlinearities using state-dependent local projections: under high inflation uncertainty, firms successfully pass cost increases on to consumers, sustaining elevated prices; under low uncertainty, recessionary effects dominate, leading firms to cut prices below baseline.</description>

Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.</description>

      <title>Escaping the Subprime Trap in Algorithmic Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17816</link>

Abstract: Disparities in lending to minority applicants persist even as algorithmic lending finds widespread adoption. We study the role of risk-management constraints, specifically Value-at-Risk ($\VaR$) and Expected Shortfall (ES), in inducing inequality in loan approval decisions, even among applicants who are equally creditworthy. Empirical research finds that disparities in the interest rates charged to minority groups can remain large even when loan applicants from different groups are equally creditworthy. We contribute an original analysis of 431,551 loan applications recorded under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, illustrating that disparities in data quality are associated with higher rates of loan denial and higher interest rate spreads for Black borrowers. We develop a formal model in which a mainstream bank (low-interest) is more sensitive to variance risk than a subprime bank (high-interest). If the mainstream bank has an inflated prior belief about the variance of the minority group, it may deny that group credit indefinitely, thus never learning the true risk of lending to that group, while the subprime lender serves this population at higher rates. We call this ``The Subprime Trap'': an equilibrium in which minority lenders can borrow only from high-cost lenders, even when they are as creditworthy as majority applicants. Finally, we show that a finite subsidy can help minority groups escape the trap: subsidies cover enough of the mainstream bank's downside risk so that it can afford to lend to, and thereby learn the true risk of lending to, the minority group. Once the mainstream bank has observed sufficiently many loans, its beliefs converge to the true underlying risk, it approves the applications of minority groups, and competition drives down the interest rates of subprime loans.</description>

      <title>Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03288v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</description>
