      <title>FastImpute: A Baseline for Open-source, Reference-Free Genotype Imputation Methods -- A Case Study in PRS313</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genotype imputation enhances genetic data by predicting missing SNPs using reference haplotype information. Traditional methods leverage linkage disequilibrium (LD) to infer untyped SNP genotypes, relying on the similarity of LD structures between genotyped target sets and fully sequenced reference panels. Recently, reference-free deep learning-based methods have emerged, offering a promising alternative by predicting missing genotypes without external databases, thereby enhancing privacy and accessibility. However, these methods often produce models with tens of millions of parameters, leading to challenges such as the need for substantial computational resources to train and inefficiency for client-sided deployment. Our study addresses these limitations by introducing a baseline for a novel genotype imputation pipeline that supports client-sided imputation models generalizable across any genotyping chip and genomic region. This approach enhances patient privacy by performing imputation directly on edge devices. As a case study, we focus on PRS313, a polygenic risk score comprising 313 SNPs used for breast cancer risk prediction. Utilizing consumer genetic panels such as 23andMe, our model democratizes access to personalized genetic insights by allowing 23andMe users to obtain their PRS313 score. We demonstrate that simple linear regression can significantly improve the accuracy of PRS313 scores when calculated using SNPs imputed from consumer gene panels, such as 23andMe. Our linear regression model achieved an R^2 of 0.86, compared to 0.33 without imputation and 0.28 with simple imputation (substituting missing SNPs with the minor allele frequency). These findings suggest that popular SNP analysis libraries could benefit from integrating linear regression models for genotype imputation, providing a viable and light-weight alternative to reference based imputation.</description>

      <title>Microbial and Viral Ecology Analysis for Metagenomic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosion in known microbial diversity in the last two decades has made it abundantly clear that microbes in the environment do not exist in isolation; they are members of communities. Accordingly, omics approaches such as metagenomics have revealed that interactions between diverse groups of community members such as archaea, bacteria, and viruses (bacteriophage) are common and have significant impacts on entire microbiomes. Thus, to have a well-developed understanding of microbes as they naturally exist in the environment, biological entities of all kinds must be studied together. While numerous protocols for metagenome analysis exist, comprehensive published protocols for the simultaneous analysis of viruses and prokaryotes together are scarce. Further, as bioinformatic methods for microbiology rapidly advance, existing metagenomic tools and pipelines require frequent reevaluation. This ensures the adherence of best practices for microbiome and metagenomic data analysis. Here, we offer an expansive approach for the joint analysis of bulk sequence data from a mixed microbial community (metagenomes) and viral-sized fraction communities (viromes). This chapter serves as a beginner's-level guide for researchers with limited bioinformatics expertise who wish to engage in multi-scale metagenome and virome analyses. We cover steps from initial study design to sequence read processing, metagenome assembly, quality control, virus identification, microbial and viral genome binning, taxonomic characterization, species-level clustering, and host-virus predictions. We also provide the bioinformatic scripts used in our workflow for reuse in one's own computational methods. Lastly, we discuss additional approaches a researcher can take after processing data with this workflow.</description>
