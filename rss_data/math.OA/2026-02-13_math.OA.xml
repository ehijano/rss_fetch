      <title>Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities for maps in noncommutative Lp-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a generalized Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for positive sesquilinear maps with values in noncommutative Lp-spaces for p &gt; 1 are obtained. Bound estimates for their real and imaginary parts are also provided, and, as an application, a generalization of the uncertainty relation in the context of noncommutative L2-spaces are given. Next, a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for positive sesquilinear maps with values in the space of bounded linear operators from a von Neumann algebra into a C*-algebra equipped with the numerical radius norm is proved. In the same spirit, a new norm on a noncommutative L2-space, which generalizes the classical numerical radius norm of bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space, is proposed, and a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for positive sesquilinear maps with values in the space of bounded linear operators from a von-Neumann algebra into the noncommutative L2-space equipped with this new norm is proved. These results are used to get representations of general positive linear maps with values into a non-commutative Lp-space and into certain operator spaces in several different situations. Some concrete examples are also given.</description>

      <title>Amenable unitary representations of locally compact groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a second countable locally compact groupoid equipped with a Haar system $\lambda$.In this work, we introduce and develop the notion of amenability for continuous unitary representations of $G$, formulated in terms of Hilbert bundles over the unit space $G^{0}$. We prove that $G$ is amenable if and only if its left regular representation is amenable, thereby extending Bekka's characterisation of amenable unitary representations from groups to groupoids. We further investigate the amenability of induced representations of $G$ and also study the representation of properly amenable groupoids. Finally, we define a topological invariant mean associated with a representation, constructed by utilising the theory of operator-valued vector measures on the unit space $G^{0}$, to characterise amenability.</description>

      <title>Trace arithmetic--$\kappa_p$ inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a unital $C^\ast$-algebra equipped with a faithful tracial positive linear functional $\tau$. Denote by $\mathcal{A}_+$ its positive cone. For $p&gt;0$ and $A,B\in\mathcal{A}_+$, we consider the operations $$ A\kappa_p B := \bigl(A^{p/4} B^{p/2} A^{p/4}\bigr)^{1/p}, \qquad A\nabla B := \frac{A+B}{2}. $$ We prove that, for all $p&gt;0$ and all $A,B\in\mathcal{A}_+$, $$ \tau(A\kappa_p B)\le \sqrt{\tau(A)\tau(B)}\le \tau(A\nabla B), $$ thereby answering \cite[Problem~1]{KM24}, posed by \'A.~Kom\'alovics and L.~Moln\'ar, in the affirmative. We also record a unitarily invariant norm analogue of the key estimate in the matrix case, and we provide explicit $2\times2$ counterexamples showing that the triangle inequality for $d_p$ may fail when $0&lt;p&lt;1$ (already for $p=\tfrac12$), giving a partial answer to \cite[Problem~2]{KM24}.</description>

      <title>Gr\"obner bases of Burchnall-Chaundy ideals for ordinary differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators (ODOs) and algebraic curves was established by Burchnall and Chaundy, Krichever and Mumford, among many others. To make this correspondence computationally effective, in this paper we aim to compute the defining ideals of spectral curves, Burchnall-Chaundy (BC) ideals. We provide an algorithm to compute a Gr\"obner basis of a BC ideal. The point of departure is the computation of the finite set of generators of a maximal commutative ring of ODOs, which was implemented by the authors in the package dalgebra of SageMath. The algorithm to compute BC ideals has been also implemented in dalgebra.
  The differential Galois theory of the corresponding spectral problems, linear differential equations with parameters, would benefit from the computation on this prime ideal, generated by constant coefficient polynomials. In particular, we prove the primality of the differential ideal generated by a BC ideal, after extending the coefficient field. This is a fundamental result to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems.</description>

      <title>A family of matrix flows converging to normal matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Antezana-Pujals-Stojanoff Theorem states that the iterated Aluthge transforms of an arbitrary matrix converge to a normal matrix. We introduce a family of matrix flows that share this convergence property by defining them through ordinary differential equations. The family includes a continuous analogue of the Aluthge transform, as well as a differential equation discussed by Haagerup in the context of II$_1$ factors. We also examine the same type of flows in the setting of Hilbert space operators equipped with unitarily invariant norms.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of random representations of free products of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the polynomial method of Chen--Garza-Vargas--Tropp--van Handel and Magee--Puder--van Handel for operator-norm bounds in random permutation models to the setting where torsion is present. The main new feature is that asymptotic expansion of traces naturally involves fractional powers of $N$ rather than an ordinary Laurent series. We formulate fractional-power analogues of the method's key hypotheses and prove they lead to strong convergence. We verify these analogues for free products of finite groups $\Gamma=G_1*\cdots*G_m$. Concretely, for a uniformly random $\phi_N\in{\rm hom}(\Gamma,{\rm Sym}(N))$, set $\pi_N = {\rm std} \circ \phi_N$, where ${\rm std}$ denotes the standard $(N-1)$-dimensional representation of ${\rm Sym}(N)$ (the permutation representation with the trivial subrepresentation removed). We deduce strong convergence of $\pi_N$ to the left regular representation of $\Gamma$. As applications, we obtain asymptotically sharp spectral gaps for the associated random Schreier graphs, including almost Ramanujan behavior for $C_2*C_2*C_2$ and an explicit non-Ramanujan limiting spectral radius for $C_2*C_3 \cong {\rm PSL}_2({\bf Z})$.</description>

      <title>Rokhlin Dimension and Inductive Limit Actions on AF-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a separable, AF-algebra A and an inductive limit action on A of a finitely generated abelian group with finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers, we give a local description of the associated crossed product C*-algebra. In particular, when A is unital and $\alpha \in Aut(A)$ is approximately inner and has the Rokhlin property, we conclude that $A \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb{Z}$ is an A$\mathbb{T}$-algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove various finite de Finetti theorems for non-commutative distributions which are invariant under the free easy quantum group actions. This complements the free de Finetti theorems by Banica, Curran and Speicher, which mostly focus on infinite sequences. We also discuss some refined results for the infinite setting.</description>

      <title>A note on strong similarity and the Connes embedding problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exists a completely bounded (c.b. in short) homomorphism $u$ from a $C^*$-algebra $C$ with the lifting property (in short LP) into a QWEP von Neumann algebra $N$ that is not strongly similar to a $*$-homomorphism, i.e. the similarities that ``orthogonalize" $u$ (which exist since $u$ is c.b.) cannot belong to the von Neumann algebra $N$. Moreover, the map $u$ does not admit any c.b. lifting up into the WEP $C^*$-algebra of which $N$ is a quotient. We can take $C=C^*(F_\infty)$ the full $C^*$-algebra of the free group $F_\infty$ with infinitely many generators and $N= B(H)\bar \otimes M$ where $M$ is the von Neumann algebra generated by the reduced $C^*$-algebra of $F_\infty$. Incidentally we observe an analogue for strong similarity of Haagerup's (and Paulsen's) similarity formula for the cb-norm : if $C$ is any unital $C^*$-algebra and $N$ any von Neumann algebra then for any bounded unital homomorphism $u: C \to N$ we have $$\|u\|_{mb}= \inf\{ \|S\|\|S^{-1}\| \}$$ where the inf (which is attained) runs over all invertible $S\in N$ such that $S u(.) S^{-1}$ is a $*$-homomorphism.</description>
