      <title>Gradient Flow Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Gradient Flow (GF) decoding for LDPC codes. GF decoding, a continuous-time methodology based on gradient flow, employs a potential energy function associated with bipolar codewords of LDPC codes. The decoding process of the GF decoding is concisely defined by an ordinary differential equation and thus it is well suited to an analog circuit implementation. We experimentally demonstrate that the decoding performance of the GF decoding for AWGN channels is comparable to that of the multi-bit mode gradient descent bit flipping algorithm. We further introduce the negative log-likelihood function of the channel for generalizing the GF decoding. The proposed method is shown to be tensor-computable, which means that the gradient of the objective function can be evaluated with the combination of basic tensor computations. This characteristic is well-suited to emerging AI accelerators, potentially applicable in wireless signal processing. The paper assesses the decoding performance of the generalized GF decoding in LDPC-coded MIMO channels. Our numerical experiments reveal that the decoding performance rivals that of established techniques like MMSE + BP. Furthermore, an exploration of score-based channel learning for capturing statistical properties is also provided.</description>

      <title>Statistical AoI Guarantee Optimization for Supporting xURLLC in ISAC-enabled V2I Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of supporting next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) within integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. We incorporate channel evaluation and retransmission mechanisms for real-time reliability enhancement. Using stochastic network calculus (SNC), we establish a theoretical framework to derive upper bounds for the peak age of information violation probability (PAVP) via characterized sensing and communication moment generation functions (MGFs). By optimizing these bounds, we develop power allocation schemes that significantly reduce the statistical PAVP of sensory packets in such networks. Simulations validate our theoretical derivations and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Group Testing and Pooled Data in the Linear Regime with Sublinear Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pooled data problem, the goal is to identify the categories associated with a large collection of items via a sequence of pooled tests. Each pooled test reveals the number of items in the pool belonging to each category. A prominent special case is quantitative group testing (QGT), which is the case of pooled data with two categories. We consider these problems in the non-adaptive and linear regime, where the fraction of items in each category is of constant order. We propose a scheme with a spatially coupled Bernoulli test matrix and an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for recovery. We rigorously characterize its asymptotic performance in both the noiseless and noisy settings, and prove that in the noiseless case, the AMP algorithm achieves almost-exact recovery with a number of tests sublinear in the number of items. For both QGT and pooled data, this is the first efficient scheme that provably achieves recovery in the linear regime with a sublinear number of tests, with performance degrading gracefully in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the spatially coupled scheme at finite dimensions, showing that it outperforms i.i.d. test designs as well as other recovery algorithms based on convex programming.</description>

      <title>Micro frequency hopping spread spectrum modulation and encryption technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining traditional frequency hopping ideas with the concepts of subcarriers and sampling points in OFDM baseband systems, this paper proposes a frequency hopping technology within the baseband called micro frequency hopping. Based on the concept of micro frequency hopping, this paper proposes a micro frequency hopping spread spectrum modulation method based on cyclic frequency shift and cyclic time shift, as well as a micro frequency hopping encryption method based on phase scrambling of baseband signals. Specifically, this paper reveals a linear micro frequency hopping symbol with good auto-correlation and cross-correlation feature in both time domain and frequency domain. Linear micro frequency hopping symbols with different root $R$ have good cross-correlation feature, which can be used in multi-user communication at same time and same frequency. Moreover, there is a linear relationship between the time delay and frequency offset of this linear micro frequency hopping symbol, making it suitable for time delay and frequency offset estimation, also for ranging, and speed measurement. Finally, this paper also verifies the advantages of micro frequency hopping technology through an example of a linear micro frequency hopping spread spectrum multiple access communication system. The author believes that micro frequency hopping technology will be widely used in fields such as the Internet of Things, military communication, satellite communication, satellite positioning, and radar etc.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization with Self-Interference Mitigation in MA-ISAC system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beamforming design has been extensively investigated in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The use of movable antennas has proven effective in enhancing the design of beamforming. Although some studies have explored joint optimization of transmit beamforming matrices and antenna positions in bistatic scenarios, there is a gap in the literature regarding monostatic full-duplex (FD) systems. To fill this gap, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions at both the transmitter and the receiver in a monostatic FD system. In an FD system, suppressing self-interference is crucial. This interference can be significantly reduced by carefully designing transmit and receive beamforming matrices. To further enhance the suppression, we derive a formulation of self-interference characterized by antenna position vectors. This enables the strategic positioning of movable antennas to further mitigate interference. Our approach optimizes the weighted sum of communication capacity and mutual information by simultaneously optimizing beamforming and antenna positions for both tranceivers. Specifically, we propose a coarse-to-fine grained search algorithm (CFGS) to find optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm provides significant improvements for the MA system compared to conventional fixed-position antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Secret Sharing for Secure and Private Information Retrieval: A Construction Using Algebraic Geometry Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) considers the problem of retrieving a data item from a database or distributed storage system without disclosing any information about which data item was retrieved. Secure PIR complements this problem by further requiring the contents of the data to be kept secure. Privacy and security can be achieved by adding suitable noise to the queries and data using methods from secret sharing. In this paper, a new framework for homomorphic secret sharing in secure and private information retrieval from colluding servers is proposed, generalizing the original cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes proposed by Jia, Sun, and Jafar. We utilize this framework to give a secure PIR construction using algebraic geometry codes over hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus. It is shown that the proposed scheme offers interesting tradeoffs between the field size, file size, number of colluding servers, and the total number of servers. When the field size is fixed, this translates in some cases to higher retrieval rates than those of the original scheme. In addition, the new schemes exist also for some parameters where the original ones do not.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Line-of-Sight Fading Distribution: Statistical Characterization and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the fluctuating Line-of-Sight (fLoS) fading model, characterized by parameters $K$, $k$, $\lambda$, and $\Omega$. The fLoS fading distribution is expressed in terms of the multivariate confluent hypergeometric functions $\Psi_2$, $\Phi_3^{(n)}$, and $\Phi_3 = \Phi_3^{(2)}$ and encompasses well-known distributions, such as the Nakagami-$m$, Hoyt, Rice, and Rician shadowed fading distributions as special cases. An efficient method to numerically compute the fLoS fading distribution is also addressed. Notably, for a positive integer $k$, the fLoS fading distribution simplifies to a finite mixture of $\kappa$-$\mu$ distributions. Additionally, we analyze the outage probability and Ergodic capacity, presenting a tailored Prony's approximation method for the latter. Numerical results are presented to show the impact of the fading parameters and verify the accuracy of the proposed approximation. Moreover, we illustrate an application of the proposed fLoS fading distribution for characterizing wireless systems affected by channel aging.</description>

      <title>Ground-to-UAV and RIS-assisted UAV-to-Ground Communication Under Channel Aging: Statistical Characterization and Outage Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the statistical characterization of ground-to-air (G2A) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted air-to-ground (A2G) communications in RIS-assisted UAV networks under the impact of channel aging. A comprehensive channel model is presented, which incorporates the time-varying fading, three-dimensional (3D) mobility, Doppler shifts, and the effects of channel aging on array antenna structures. We provide analytical expressions for the G2A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), demonstrating that the G2A SNR follows a mixture of noncentral $\chi^2$ distributions. The A2G communication is characterized under RIS arbitrary phase-shift configurations, showing that the A2G SNR can be represented as the product of two correlated noncentral $\chi^2$ random variables (RVs). Additionally, we present the PDF and the CDF of the product of two independently distributed noncentral $\chi^2$ RVs, which accurately characterize the A2G SNR's distribution. Our paper confirms the effectiveness of RISs in mitigating channel aging effects within the coherence time. Finally, we propose an adaptive spectral efficiency method that ensures consistent system performance and satisfactory outage levels when the UAV and the ground user equipments are in motion.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Metrics and Methods for Generative Models in the Wireless PHY Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models are typically evaluated by direct inspection of their generated samples, e.g., by visual inspection in the case of images. Further evaluation metrics like the Fr\'echet inception distance or maximum mean discrepancy are intricate to interpret and lack physical motivation. These observations make evaluating generative models in the wireless PHY layer non-trivial. This work establishes a framework consisting of evaluation metrics and methods for generative models applied to the wireless PHY layer. The proposed metrics and methods are motivated by wireless applications, facilitating interpretation and understandability for the wireless community. In particular, we propose a spectral efficiency analysis for validating the generated channel norms and a codebook fingerprinting method to validate the generated channel directions. Moreover, we propose an application cross-check to evaluate the generative model's samples for training machine learning-based models in relevant downstream tasks. Our analysis is based on real-world measurement data and includes the Gaussian mixture model, variational autoencoder, diffusion model, and generative adversarial network as generative models. Our results under a fair comparison in terms of model architecture indicate that solely relying on metrics like the maximum mean discrepancy produces insufficient evaluation outcomes. In contrast, the proposed metrics and methods exhibit consistent and explainable behavior.</description>

      <title>Load Balancing in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning framework that enables learning from data distributed across multiple remote devices, enhancing communication efficiency and data privacy. Due to limited communication resources, a scheduling policy is often applied to select a subset of devices for participation in each FL round. The scheduling process confronts significant challenges due to the need for fair workload distribution, efficient resource utilization, scalability in environments with numerous edge devices, and statistically heterogeneous data across devices. This paper proposes a load metric for scheduling policies based on the Age of Information and addresses the above challenges by minimizing the load metric variance across the clients. Furthermore, a decentralized Markov scheduling policy is presented, that ensures a balanced workload distribution while eliminating the management overhead irrespective of the network size due to independent client decision-making. We establish the optimal parameters of the Markov chain model and validate our approach through simulations. The results demonstrate that reducing the load metric variance not only promotes fairness and improves operational efficiency, but also enhances the convergence rate of the learning models.</description>

      <title>Finding Defective Elements in Intelligent Reflecting Surface via Over-the-Air Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to circuit failures, defective elements that cannot adaptively adjust the phase shifts of their impinging signals in a desired manner may exist on an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Traditional way to find these defective IRS elements requires a thorough diagnosis of all the circuits belonging to a huge number of IRS elements, which is practically challenging. In this paper, we will devise a novel approach under which a transmitter sends known pilot signals and a receiver localizes all the defective IRS elements just based on its over-the-air measurements reflected from the IRS. The key lies in the fact that the over-the-air measurements at the receiver side are functions of the set of defective IRS elements. Based on this observation, we propose a bisection based method to localize all the defective IRS elements. Specifically, at each time slot, we properly control the desired phase shifts of all the IRS elements such that half of the considered regime that is not useful to localize the defective elements can be found based on the received signals and removed. Via numerical results, it is shown that our proposed bisection method can exploit the over-the-air measurements to localize all the defective IRS elements quickly and accurately.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Threshold Qutrit Magic State Distillation Routines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the best attainable threshold for qudit magic state distillation is directly related to the question of whether or not contextuality is sufficient for universal quantum computation. We carry out a search for high-threshold magic state distillation routines for a highly-symmetric qutrit magic state known as the strange state. Our search covers a large class of $[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with up to 23 qutrits, and is facilitated by a theorem that relates the distillation performance of a qudit stabilizer code to its weight-enumerators. We could not find any code with $n&lt;23$ qutrits that distills the strange state with better than linear noise suppression, other than the 11-qutrit Golay code. However, for $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS codes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression. While none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code, their existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the qutrit strange state is somewhat generic.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Power-Aware Learned Optimization for Modular Receive Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems play a key role in wireless communication technologies. A widely considered approach to realize scalable MIMO systems involves architectures comprised of multiple separate modules, each with its own beamforming capability. Such models accommodate cell-free massive MIMO and partially connected hybrid MIMO architectures. A core issue with the implementation of modular MIMO arises from the need to rapidly set the beampatterns of the modules, while maintaining their power efficiency. This leads to challenging constrained optimization that should be repeatedly solved on each coherence duration. In this work, we propose a power-oriented optimization algorithm for beamforming in uplink modular hybrid MIMO systems, which learns from data to operate rapidly. We derive our learned optimizer by tackling the rate maximization objective using projected gradient ascent steps with momentum. We then leverage data to tune the hyperparameters of the optimizer, allowing it to operate reliably in a fixed and small number of iterations while completely preserving its interpretable operation. We show how power efficient beamforming can be encouraged by the learned optimizer, via boosting architectures with low-resolution phase shifts and with deactivated analog components. Numerical results show that our learn-to-optimize method notably reduces the number of iterations and computation latency required to reliably tune modular MIMO receivers, and that it allows obtaining desirable balances between power efficient designs and throughput.</description>

      <title>Application of Transformers for Nonlinear Channel Compensation in Optical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear optical channel equalizer based on Transformers. By leveraging parallel computation and attending directly to the memory across a sequence of symbols, we show that Transformers can be used effectively for nonlinear compensation (NLC) in coherent long-haul transmission systems. For this application, we present an implementation of the encoder part of the Transformer and analyze its performance over a wide range of different hyper-parameters. It is shown that by proper embeddings and processing blocks of symbols at each iteration and also carefully selecting subsets of the encoder's output to be processed together, an efficient nonlinear equalization can be achieved for different complexity constraints. To reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism, we further propose the use of a physic-informed mask inspired by nonlinear perturbation theory. We also compare the Transformer-NLC with digital back-propagation (DBP) under different transmission scenarios in order to demonstrate the flexibility and generalizability of the proposed data-driven solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the frozen set design for precoded polar codes decoded by the successive cancellation list (SCL) algorithm. We propose a novel frozen set design method, whose computational complexity is low due to the use of analytical bounds and constrained frozen set structure. We derive new bounds based on the recently published complexity analysis of SCL decoding with near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance. To predict the ML performance, we employ the state-of-the-art bounds relying on the code weight distribution. The bounds and constrained frozen set structure are incorporated into the genetic algorithm to generate optimized frozen sets with low complexity. Our simulation results show that the constructed precoded polar codes of length 512 have a superior frame error rate (FER) performance compared to the state-of-the-art codes under SCL decoding with various list sizes.</description>

Abstract: In-band full-duplex (IBFD) is a theoretically effective solution to increase the overall throughput for the future wireless communications system by enabling transmission and reception over the same time-frequency resources. However, reliable source reconstruction remains a great challenge in the practical IBFD systems due to the non-ideal elimination of the self-interference and the inherent limitations of the separate source and channel coding methods. On the other hand, artificial intelligence-enabled semantic communication can provide a viable direction for the optimization of the IBFD system. This article introduces a novel IBFD paradigm with the guidance of semantic communication called semantics-division duplexing (SDD). It utilizes semantic domain processing to further suppress self-interference, distinguish the expected semantic information, and recover the desired sources. Further integration of the digital and semantic domain processing can be implemented so as to achieve intelligent and concise communications. We present the advantages of the SDD paradigm with theoretical explanations and provide some visualized results to verify its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Improved Trade-offs Between Amortization and Download Bandwidth for Linear HSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Homomorphic Secret Sharing (HSS) scheme is a secret-sharing scheme that shares a secret $x$ among $s$ servers, and additionally allows an output client to reconstruct some function $f(x)$ using information that can be locally computed by each server. A key parameter in HSS schemes is download rate, which quantifies how much information the output client needs to download from the servers. Often, download rate is improved by amortizing over $\ell$ instances of the problem, making $\ell$ also a key parameter of interest.
  Recent work (Fosli, Ishai, Kolobov, and Wootters 2022) established a limit on the download rate of linear HSS schemes for computing low-degree polynomials and constructed schemes that achieve this optimal download rate; their schemes required amortization over $\ell = \Omega(s \log(s))$ instances of the problem. Subsequent work (Blackwell and Wootters, 2023) completely characterized linear HSS schemes that achieve optimal download rate in terms of a coding-theoretic notion termed optimal labelweight codes. A consequence of this characterization was that $\ell = \Omega(s \log(s))$ is in fact necessary to achieve optimal download rate.
  In this paper, we characterize all linear HSS schemes, showing that schemes of any download rate are equivalent to a generalization of optimal labelweight codes. This equivalence is constructive and provides a way to obtain an explicit linear HSS scheme from any linear code. Using this characterization, we present explicit linear HSS schemes with slightly sub-optimal rate but with much improved amortization $\ell = O(s)$. Our constructions are based on algebraic geometry codes (specifically Hermitian codes and Goppa codes).</description>

      <title>Variable-Length Stop-Feedback Coding for Minimum Age of Incorrect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) is studied within the context of remote monitoring a Markov source using variable-length stop-feedback (VLSF) coding. Leveraging recent results on the non-asymptotic channel coding rate, we consider sources with small cardinality, where feedback is non-instantaneous as the transmitted information and feedback message have comparable lengths. We focus on the feedback sequence, i.e. the times of feedback transmissions, and derive AoII-optimal and delay-optimal feedback sequences. Our results showcase the impact of the feedback sequence on the AoII, revealing that a lower average delay does not necessarily correspond to a lower average AoII. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for coding scheme design.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Multiple Access Assisted Integrated Data and Energy Transfer: Outage and Multiplexing Gain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) exploits the spatial opportunities in wireless channels to overcome multiuser interference by position (a.k.a.~port) switching, which can achieve better performance compared to traditional fixed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Additionally, integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is capable of providing both wireless data transfer (WDT) and wireless energy transfer (WET) services towards low-power devices. In this paper, a FAMA-assisted IDET system is investigated, where a base station (BS) equipped with $N$ fixed antennas provides dedicated IDET services towards $N$ user equipments (UEs). Each UE is equipped with a single fluid antenna, while the power splitting (PS) approach is conceived for coordinating WDT and WET. The outage probabilities of both WDT and WET are derived and approximated into closed-forms, where the fluid antenna (FA) at each UE selects the optimal port to achieve the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) or the energy harvesting power (EHP). The IDET outage probabilities are defined and subsequently derived and approximated into closed-forms. Further, multiplexing gains of the proposed system are defined and analyzed to evaluate the performace. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, while also illustrate that the trade-off is achieved between WDT and WET performance by exploiting different port selection strategies. Furthermore, the number of UEs should be optimized to achieve better IDET performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource-Power Allocation and UE Rank Selection in Multi-User MIMO Systems with Linear Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks aim to deliver data speeds much faster than 5G. This requires base stations with lots of antennas and a large operating bandwidth. These advanced base stations are expected to serve several multiantenna user-equipment (UEs) simultaneously on the same time-frequency resources on both the uplink and the downlink. The UE data rates are affected by the following three main factors: UE rank, which refers to the number of data layers used by each UE, UE frequency allocation, which refers to the assignment of slices of the overall frequency band to use for each UE in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and UE power allocation/control, which refers to the allocation of power by the base station for data transmission to each UE on the downlink or the power used by each UE to send data on the uplink. Since multiple UEs are to be simultaneously served, the type of precoder used for downlink transmission and the type of receiver used for uplink reception predominantly influence these three aforementioned factors and the resulting overall UE throughput. This paper addresses the problem of jointly selecting these three parameters specifically when zero-forcing (ZF) precoders are used for downlink transmission and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) receivers are employed for uplink reception.</description>
