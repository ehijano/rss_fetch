      <title>Constructing entire minimal graphs by evolving planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an evolving-plane ansatz for the explicit construction of entire minimal graphs of dimension $n$ ($n\geq 3$) and codimension $m$ ($m\geq 2$), for any odd integer $n$. Under this ansatz, the minimal surface system reduces to the geodesic equation on the Grassmannian in affine coordinates. Geometrically, this equation dictates how the slope of an $(n-1)$ plane evolves as it sweeps out a minimal graph. This framework yields a rich family of explicit entire minimal graphs of odd dimension $n$ and arbitrary codimension $m$.</description>

      <title>On the Curvature of Regge Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use moving frame techniques to derive a notion of curvature for a class of piecewise-smooth Riemannian metrics called Regge metrics, showing that it is a measure that simultaneously satisfies the (weak) Cartan structure equations and the appropriate gauge transformation law. It turns out that this distributional curvature is equivalent to existing notions of densitized distributional curvature. We also investigate more closely the n = 2 case, where we prove the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for Regge metrics.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's fourth problem in the constant curvature setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert's fourth problem seeks the classification of metric geometries where straight lines are shortest paths. Its regular case identifies the projectively flat Finsler manifolds. This broader framework breaks the equivalence between projective flatness and constant curvature that holds in the Riemannian setting, creating a more intricate classification problem.
  This paper resolves the long-standing question of how the local structure determines the global topology for such manifolds of constant flag curvature, where flag curvature is the natural generalization of Riemannian sectional curvature. We derive explicit distance formulas for all cases of constant flag curvature. For non-positive constant curvature, we establish a global classification of forward complete manifolds, a uniqueness theorem for forward complete metrics, and a characterization of maximal domains of metrics where exotic examples are constructed. For positive constant curvature, we prove a maximum diameter theorem and show the completion of such manifold is a sphere. A fundamental connection is revealed between Sobolev space nonlinearity and backward incompleteness. This work provides a complete characterization of the global geometry for the regular case of Hilbert's fourth problem with constant flag curvature.</description>

      <title>Atiyah class of DG manifolds of positive amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25308v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behrend, Liao, and Xu showed that differential graded (DG) manifolds of positive amplitude forms a category of fibrant objects. In particular, this ensures that notion of derived intersection -- more generally, homotopy fibre product -- is well-defined up to weak equivalences. We prove that the Atiyah and Todd classes of DG manifolds of positive amplitude are invariant under the weak equivalences.
  As an application, we study Hochschild cohomology of DG manifolds of positive amplitude defined using poly-differential operators, which is compatible with Kontsevich formality theorem and Duflo--Kontsevich-type theorem established by Liao, Sti\'enon and Xu. We prove that this Hochschild cohomology is invariant under weak equivalences.</description>

      <title>The $p$-th dual Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity corresponding to a $k$-Hessian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the dual curvature measures [Y. Huang, E. Lutwak, D. Yang \&amp; G. Y. Zhang, Acta. Math. 216 (2016): 325-388], which connects the cone-volume measure and Aleksandrov's integral curvature, and has created a precedent for the theoretical research of the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory.
  Motivated by the foregoing groundbreaking works, the present paper introduces the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and establishes its Hadamard variational formula with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, which induces the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional measure. Further, based on the $p$-th dual $k$-torsional measure, this article, for the first time, proposes the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem of the $k$-torsional rigidity which can be equivalently converted to a nonlinear partial differential equation in smooth case: \begin{align}\label{eq01} f(x)=\tau(|\nabla h|^2+h^2)^{\frac{p-n}{2}}h_{\Omega}(x)|Du(\nu^{-1}_\Omega(x))|^{k+1}\sigma_{n-k}(h_{ij}(x)+h_\Omega(x)\delta_{ij}), \end{align} where $\tau&gt;0$ is a constant, $f$ is a positive smooth function defined on $S^{n-1}$ and $\sigma_{n-k}$ is the $(n-k)$-th elementary symmetric function of the principal curvature radii. We confirm the existence of smooth non-even solution to the $p$-th dual Minkowski problem of the $k$-torsional rigidity for $p&lt;n-2$ by the method of a curvature flow which converges smoothly to the solution of equation (\ref{eq01}). Specially, a novel approach for the uniform lower bound estimation in the $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow is presented with the help of invariant functional $\Phi(\Omega_t)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion of the variation of the Quillen metric and its moment map interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In K\"ahler geometry, the Donaldson-Fujiki moment map picture interprets the scalar curvature of a K\"ahler metric as a moment map on the space of compatible almost complex structures on a fixed symplectic manifold. In this paper, we generalize this picture using the framework of equivariant determinant line bundles. Given a prequantization $P=(L,h,\nabla)$ of a compact symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, let $\mathcal{G}=\mathrm{Aut}(P)$. We construct for each $k\in\mathbb{N}$ a $\mathcal{G}$-equivariant determinant line bundle $\lambda^{(k)}\rightarrow\mathcal{J}_{int}$ on the space of integrable compatible almost complex structures, equipped with the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant Quillen metric. The curvature form of $\lambda^{(k)}$ admits an asymptotic expansion whose coefficients yield a sequence of $\mathcal{G}$-invariant closed two-forms $\Omega_j$ on $\mathcal{J}_{int}$ and corresponding moment maps $\mu_j:\mathcal{J}_{int}\rightarrow C^\infty(M)$. Each $\mu_j$ arises from the asymptotic expansion of the variation of the log of the Quillen metric with respect to K\"ahler potentials, keeping the complex structure fixed. This provides a natural generalization of the Donaldson-Fujiki moment map interpretation of scalar curvature. Moreover, we show that $\mu_j$ coincide with the $Z$-critical equations introduced by Dervan-Hallam, and we state a generalization of Fujiki's fiber integral formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper completes the classification of seven-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups endowed with a left-invariant purely coclosed $\text{G}_2$-structure, initiated by the first-named author and collaborators. In this previous work, the authors provided the classification of decomposable seven-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups and of the indecomposable ones up to step $4$ of nilpotency. Here, we address the case of indecomposable $5$- and $6$-step nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Holonomy in pseudo-Hermitian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holonomy that is associated to a sub-Riemannian structure defined on the kernel of a global contact form. This includes the holonomy of Schouten's horizontal connection as well as of the adapted connection, both canonical invariants of the structure. Under a condition on the torsion of the structure, we show that they are either equal or that the former is a codimension one normal subgroup of the latter. Furthermore, we establish a close relation to Riemannian holonomy, which yields a complete holonomy classification in the torsion-free case. For the main result we focus on the special case of pseudo-Hermitian structures and give a classification of holonomy algebras for both the Schouten and the adapted connection. Based on this, we derive a classification of symmetric sub-Riemannian structures and of of those holonomy groups that admit parallel spinors. Finally we exhibit a relation between locally symmetric sub-Riemannian contact structures and locally homogeneous Riemannian structures.</description>

      <title>Tight Spherical Embeddings (Updated Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an updated version of a paper which appeared in the proceedings of the 1979 Berlin Colloquium on Global Differential Geometry. This paper contains the original exposition together with some notes by the authors made in 2025 (as indicated in the text) that give references to descriptions of progress made in the field since the time of the original version of the paper. The main result of this paper is that every compact isoparametric hypersurface $M^n \subset S^{n+1} \subset {\bf R}^{n+2}$ is tight, i.e., every non-degenerate linear height function $\ell_p$, $p \in S^{n+1}$, has the minimum number of critical points on $M^n$ required by the Morse inequalities. Since $M^n$ lies in the sphere $S^{n+1}$, this implies that $M^n$ is also taut in $S^{n+1}$, i.e., every non-degenerate spherical distance function has the minimum number of critical points on $M^n$. A second result is that the focal submanifolds of isoparametric hypersurfaces in $S^{n+1}$ must also be taut. The proofs of these results are based on M\"{u}nzner's fundamental work on the structure of a family of isoparametric hypersurfaces in a sphere.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the notion of $m$-plurisubharmonic function introduced recently by Dieu and studied, in particular, by Harvey and Lawson, we consider $m$-(semi-)positive $(1,\,1)$-currents and Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on complex Hermitian manifolds and prove two kinds of results: vanishing theorems and $L^2$-estimates for the $\bar\partial$-equation in the context of $C^\infty$ $m$-positive Hermitian fibre metrics; global and local regularisation theorems for $m$-semi-positive $(1,\,1)$-currents whose proofs involve the use of viscosity subsolutions for a certain Monge-Amp\`ere-type equation and the associated Dirichlet problem.</description>

      <title>The Neural Differential Manifold: An Architecture with Explicit Geometric Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach, including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.</description>

Abstract: We consider stochastically perturbed wave maps from $\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into $\mathbb{S}^d$, in all energy-supercritical dimensions $d \geq 3$. We show that corotational non-degenerate Gaussian additive noise leads to self-similar blowup with positive probability for any corotational initial data. The same result without noise is conjectured, but unknown, for large data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of Alesker's Irreducibility Theorem. We first introduce a new localization technique for polynomial valuations on convex bodies, which we use to independently prove that smooth and translation invariant valuations are representable by integration with respect to the normal cycle. This allows us to reduce the statement to a corresponding result for the representation of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ on the space of these differential forms.</description>

      <title>An almost-almost-Schur lemma on the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent preprint, Frank and the second author proved that if a metric on the sphere of dimension $d&gt;4$ almost minimizes the total $\sigma_2$-curvature in the conformal class of the standard metric, then it is almost the standard metric (up to M\"obius transformations). This is achieved quantitatively in terms of a two-term distance to the set of minimizing conformal factors. We extend this result to the case $d=3$. While the standard metric still minimizes the total scalar curvature for $d=3$, it maximizes the total $\sigma_2$-curvature, which turns the related functional inequality into a reverse Sobolev-type inequality. As a corollary of our result, we obtain quantitative versions for a family of interpolation inequalities including the Andrews--De Lellis--Topping inequality on the $3$-sphere. The latter is itself a stability result for the well-known Schur lemma and is therefore called almost-Schur lemma. This makes our stability result an almost-almost-Schur lemma.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional flats in the space of positive metrics on an ample line bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any continuous positive metric on an ample line bundle L lies at the apex of many infinite-dimensional Mabuchi-flat cones. More precisely, given any bounded graded filtration F of the section ring of L, the set of bounded decreasing convex functions on the support of the Duistermaat--Heckman measure of F embeds L^p-isometrically into the space of bounded positive metrics on L with respect to Darvas' d_p distance for all p\in[1,\infty), and in particular with respect to the Mabuchi metric (p=2).</description>

      <title>The Atiyah class of DG manifolds of amplitude $+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A DG manifold of amplitude $+1$ encodes the derived intersection of a section $s$ and the zero section of a vector bundle $E$. In this paper, we compute the Atiyah class of DG manifolds of amplitude $+1$. In particular, we show that the Atiyah class vanishes if and only if the intersection of $s$ with the zero section is a clean intersection. As an application, we study the Atiyah class of DG manifolds that encodes the derived intersection of two smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Circle bundles with PSC over large manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>An ansatz for constructing explicit solutions of Hessian equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a (variation of quadrics) ansatz for constructing explicit, real-valued solutions to broad classes of complex Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ and real Hessian equations on domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. In the complex setting, our method simultaneously addresses the deformed Hermitian--Yang--Mills/Leung--Yau--Zaslow (dHYM/LYZ) equation, the Monge--Amp\`{e}re equation, and the $J$-equation. Under this ansatz each PDE reduces to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations admitting explicit first integrals. These ODE systems integrate in closed form via abelian integrals, producing wide families of explicit solutions together with a detailed description. In particular, on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, we construct entire dHYM/LYZ solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase, and on $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ we produce entire special Lagrangian solutions of arbitrary subcritical phase. Some of these solutions develop singularities on compact regions. In the special Lagrangian case we show that, after a natural extension across the singular locus, these blow-up solutions coincide with previously known complete special Lagrangian submanifolds obtained via a different ansatz.</description>

      <title>Laplace comparison on K\"ahler Ricci flow and convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first prove a uniform integral Laplace comparison result for the K\"ahler Ricci flow on Fano manifolds which depends only on the initial metric. As an application, using Cheeger-Colding theory and previous results by some of the authors, we give a direct and independent proof of the Hamilton-Tian conjecture on convergence of K\"ahler-Ricci flows, modulo a codimension 4 singular set. We also expounded on some existing literature on this conjecture.</description>

      <title>The exterior derivative and the mean value equality in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey revisits classical results in vector calculus and analysis by exploring a generalised perspective on the exterior derivative, interpreting it as a measure of "infinitesimal flux". This viewpoint leads to a higher-dimensional analogue of the Mean Value Theorem, valid for differential $k$-forms, and provides a natural formulation of Stokes' theorem that mirrors the exact hypotheses of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus -- without requiring full $C^1$ smoothness of the differential form.
  As a numerical application, we propose an algorithm for exterior differentiation in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that relies solely on black-box access to the differential form, offering a practical tool for computation without the need for mesh discretization or explicit symbolic expressions.</description>
