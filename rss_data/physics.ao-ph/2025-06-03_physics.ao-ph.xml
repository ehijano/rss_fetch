      <title>Automatic detection of overshooting tops and their properties from visible satellite channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overshooting tops (OTs) are critical indicators of convective storm intensity and are widely utilized in meteorological analyses. This study presents an automated algorithm for OT detection and OT height estimation using convolutional neural networks applied to visible satellite imagery. The models are trained and validated on an extensive OT dataset comprising approximately 10,000 manually detected cases over Europe. The OTs were identified from high-resolution visible (HRV) channel of the SEVIRI instrument on board the MSG geostationary satellite, with the heights determined from the length of their shadows in the imagery. While conventional OT detection methods primarily rely on the identification of cold features in thermal infrared channels, our approach extracts information from visible channels, leveraging the ground truth data on OT shadow length provided by the training dataset. In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 95% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km. The performance is expected to further improve once the model is applied to polar and new generation geostationary satellite with increased spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Cold pools, Breezes, and Monsoons: Propagating Convection over New Guinea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diurnal cycle of precipitation near New Guinea involves intricate land-ocean-atmosphere interactions, posing substantial challenges for tropical weather and climate simulations. Using over two decades of GPM satellite observations and convection-permitting WRF simulations, this study examines the physical mechanisms governing the pronounced offshore propagation of diurnal convection over New Guinea. We identify two distinct offshore propagation modes: (1) a "ridge-to-coast" mode originated over elevated terrain and migrating toward the coastline, and (2) an "over-ocean" mode initiated near the coast, separated by a spatial gap of approximately 100 km. Our findings highlight the critical role of multi-scale density currents in shaping boundary layer dynamics over warm ocean waters. Specifically, the afternoon sea-breeze front advects cooler air onshore, stabilizing the lower atmosphere and interrupting the continuous propagation of the first mode. At night, the land breeze interacts with residual cold pools, generating offshore moist patches that facilitate the convective regeneration and propagation of the second mode. These offshore convective systems interact with monsoonal background winds, sustaining precipitation well beyond 200-600 km from the coast. Sensitivity experiments indicate that even a modest increase in sea surface temperature can enhance convective intensity and extend offshore propagation. These results shed light on the mechanisms that enable diurnal offshore convection to persist overnight and propagate far from the coastline, highlighting the importance of boundary-layer density currents and offering insights for improving precipitation.</description>

      <title>Warming from cold pools: A pathway for mesoscale organization to alter Earth's radiation budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine shallow cumulus clouds have long caused large uncertainty in climate projections. These clouds frequently organize into mesoscale (10-500 km) structures, through two processes that couple the clouds to shallow mesoscale circulations: (i) mesoscale moisture aggregation, and (ii) cold pools, driven locally from rain-evaporation. Since global climate models do not capture these mesoscale processes, while the degree of mesoscale organization is observed to correlate to shortwave cooling, it has been suggested that mesoscale processes modulate the cloud response to global warming. Here, we show that introducing mesoscale dynamics can indeed substantially alter top-of-the-atmosphere radiative budget, if the balance between the two circulations is upset. By homogenizing rain-evaporation across the horizontal domain, we suppress the cold-pool-driven circulations in a large ensemble of large-domain, large-eddy simulations. We find that cold pools reduce mesoscale ascent, thereby arresting a runaway self-aggregation of moisture into very moist regions. This reduces the net rainfall of the cumulus fields, moistens the boundary layer and thus reduces the emission of clear-sky longwave radiation to space, giving an ensemble-averaged warming of 1.88 W/m2. Our results highlight that the proper interplay between mesoscale processes is critical for capturing radiative budgets-especially in kilometer-scale climate models that only partially resolve aggregation and cold pools.</description>

      <title>Effects of high-frequency and balanced motions on Lagrangian pair dispersion at the ocean surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of relative dispersion of Lagrangian particles in a global-ocean simulation resolving both inertia-gravity waves (IGW) and meso and submesoscale (M/SM) turbulence. More specifically, we test if the dispersion laws depend on the shape of the Eulerian kinetic energy spectrum, as predicted from quasi-geostrophic turbulence theory. To this end, we focus on two areas, in the Kuroshio Extension and in the Gulf Stream, for which the relative importance of IGW compared to M/SM vary in summer and winter. In winter, Lagrangian statistical indicators return a picture in overall agreement with the shape of the kinetic energy spectrum. Conversely, in summer, when submesoscales are less energetic and higher-frequency internal waves gain importance, the expected relations between dispersion properties and spectra do not seem to hold. This apparent discrepancy is explained by decomposing the flow into nearly-balanced motions and internal gravity waves, and showing that the latter dominate the kinetic energy spectrum at small scales. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-frequency IGWs do not impact relative dispersion, which is then controlled by the nearly-balanced, mainly rotational, flow component at larger scales. These results highlight that geostrophic velocities derived from wide-swath altimeters, such as SWOT, may present limits when estimating surface dispersion, and that current measuring satellite missions may provide the complementary information to do so.</description>

      <title>Rapid topographic scatter of near-inertial waves generated by storms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal waves propagate on the ocean's stratification, carrying energy and redistributing momentum through the ocean. When internal waves break, they contribute to diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior, but this breaking behaviour depends upon the scale of the waves. Low-mode internal waves have larger horizontal and vertical scales, and thus break less readily than higher-mode waves. The scattering of internal waves by topography is an important mechanism in transferring internal wave energy to smaller scales that are more conducive to wave breaking and mixing processes. In this study, we propose and investigate a mechanism in which storm-generated low-mode internal waves scatter at topography. We hypothesise that horizontally propagating internal wave modes generated by strong winds (i.e., due to a storm) can rapidly dephase; these dephased waves can then be scattered from topography, resulting in higher-mode upward-propagating waves within hours of the passage of a storm. We investigate this phenomenon in an idealised numerical model of a storm passing over a prominent ridge. Bottom-scattered near-inertial internal waves propagate away from the ridge rapidly in the wake of the storm. We perform several perturbation experiments varying the properties of the ocean, the winds and the topography. The bottom-scattered waves exhibit spatial downscaling, and have an energy flux equivalent to 10% the magnitude of the energy flux from surface-generated near-inertial waves in our domain. Although small in a globally averaged sense, we argue that the topographic scatter of storm-generated near-inertial waves could account for the unexplained near-inertial wave signals found in ocean observations and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Unravelling how winds and surface heat fluxes control the Atlantic Ocean's meridional heat transport</title>

Abstract: The North Atlantic Ocean circulation, fuelled by winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, carries 1.25 PettaWatts of heat poleward in the subtropics, and helps in regulating global weather and climate patterns. Here, we assess the relative impacts of changes in winds and surface heat fluxes on the Atlantic Ocean circulation and heat transport on short timescales (&lt;10 years) and long timescales (&gt;50 years) using ocean simulations. We decompose the circulation and heat transport into warm and cold cells (resembling a subtropical gyre and the dense overturning circulation respectively), and a mixed cell capturing waters transitioning between warm and cold regions. Warm and mixed cells transport more heat poleward as wind stress increases; however, these anomalies are compensated by reductions in the cold cell's heat transport. Warm and cold cells transport more heat poleward when we increase meridional heat flux gradients. Our findings underscore the distinct roles of winds and surface heat fluxes in controlling the Atlantic Ocean's meridional heat transport.</description>

      <title>Impact of curved elements for flows over orography with a Discontinuous Galerkin scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the impact of high-order mappings on the simulation of flows over complex orography. Curved boundaries were not used in early numerical methods, whereas they are employed to an increasing extent in state of the art computational fluid dynamics codes, in combination with high-order methods, such as the Finite Element Method and the Spectral Element Method. Here we consider a specific Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method implemented in the framework of the deal.II library, which natively supports high-order mappings. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks over idealized orographic profiles demonstrate the positive impact of curved boundaries on the accuracy of the results, with no significantly adverse effect on the computational cost of the simulation. These findings are also supported by results of the application of this approach to non-smooth and realistic orographic profiles.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>

Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric response of the North Atlantic gyres to the North Atlantic Oscillation</title>

Abstract: The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a leading mode of atmospheric variability, affecting the North Atlantic Ocean on sub-seasonal to multi-decadal timescales. The NAO changes the atmospheric forcing at the ocean's surface, including winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, both of which are known to impact large-scale gyre circulation. However, the relative role of other physical processes (such as mesoscale eddies and topography) in influencing gyre circulation under NAO variability is not fully understood. Here, we analyze a series of ocean--sea ice simulations using a barotropic vorticity budget to understand the long-term response of the North Atlantic gyre circulation to NAO forcing. We find that for each standard deviation increase in the NAO index, the subtropical and subpolar gyres intensify by 0.90 Sv and 3.41 Sv (1 Sv = 10$^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$) respectively. The NAO-induced wind stress anomalies drive approximately 90\% of the change in the subtropical gyre's interior flow. However, in the subpolar gyre's interior, in addition to wind stress, flow-topography interactions, stratification (influenced by surface heat fluxes), and non-linear advection significantly influence the circulation. Along the western boundary the bottom pressure torque plays a key role in steering the flow, and the vorticity input by the bottom pressure torque is partly redistributed by non-linear advection. Our study highlights the importance of both atmospheric forcing and oceanic dynamical processes in driving long-term gyre circulation responses to the NAO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI emulators for forecasting have emerged as powerful tools that can outperform conventional numerical predictions. The next frontier is to build emulators for long climate simulations with skill across a range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multi-depth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remain stable, requiring further work.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10 m - 10 km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. However, the instability that emerges does not exhibit characteristics that match the perhaps expected symmetric or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and appears to be non-normal in nature. The prominence of the transient response depends on the initial noise and, for large initial noise amplitudes, saturates before SI normal modes are able to develop. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid - with energy extraction from the mean flow emerging and peaking within the first inertial period (~ 18 hr) - that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, at all initial noise levels, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures; we also caution against inadvertently triggering this response in idealised studies that start in a very unstable state.</description>
