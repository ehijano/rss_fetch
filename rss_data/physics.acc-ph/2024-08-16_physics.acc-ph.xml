      <title>Time-inversion of spatiotemporal beam dynamics using uncertainty-aware latent evolution reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged particle dynamics under the influence of electromagnetic fields is a challenging spatiotemporal problem. Many high performance physics-based simulators for predicting behavior in a charged particle beam are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for solving inverse problems online. The problem of estimating upstream six-dimensional phase space given downstream measurements of charged particles in an accelerator is an inverse problem of growing importance. This paper introduces a reverse Latent Evolution Model (rLEM) designed for temporal inversion of forward beam dynamics. In this two-step self-supervised deep learning framework, we utilize a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to project 6D phase space projections of a charged particle beam into a lower-dimensional latent distribution. Subsequently, we autoregressively learn the inverse temporal dynamics in the latent space using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The coupled CVAE-LSTM framework can predict 6D phase space projections across all upstream accelerating sections based on single or multiple downstream phase space measurements as inputs. The proposed model also captures the aleatoric uncertainty of the high-dimensional input data within the latent space. This uncertainty, which reflects potential uncertain measurements at a given module, is propagated through the LSTM to estimate uncertainty bounds for all upstream predictions, demonstrating the robustness of the LSTM against in-distribution variations in the input data.</description>

      <title>Beam dynamics performance of the proposed PETRA IV storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PETRA IV project for upgrading the 2.3 km 6 GeV PETRA III storage ring to a diffraction-limited synchrotron radiation source is nearing the end of its detailed technical design phase. We present the ring lattice based on the hybrid six-bend achromat (H6BA) cell and a detailed evaluation of its beam dynamics performance. Design challenges as well as unique opportunities associated with a low emittance ring of a large size are discussed.</description>

      <title>Considerations and findings on beam vorticity dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document is on considerations and findings on modelling of spinning beams. Spinning has been proposed for stabilizing beams against perturbations notably risen by non-linear space charge forces, see [Y.-L. Cheon et al., Effects of beam spinning on the fourth-order particle resonance of 3D bunched beams in high-intensity linear accelerators, Phys. Rev. Accel. &amp; Beams 25, 064002 (2022)]. Although not further treated therein, spinning can be quantified by angular momentumor by vorticity. Considering vorticity revealed that the latter has remarkable similarity w.r.t. its modelling along solenoid channels to modelling the beam envelope. Matrices of vorticity transport, corresponding phase advances, and Twiss parameters look very similar and are partially even identical to their counterparts concerning envelopes. Corresponding to emittance, the quantity of vortissance, being a constant of motion, is defined. Unlike emittance, for vorticity-dominated beams it may take imaginary values, causing Twiss parameters, and negative or zero phase advances along a finite beam line section. This imposes considerable consequences on respective periodic solutions.</description>

      <title>Calculation of RF-induced Temporal Jitter in Ultrafast Electron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant contribution to the temporal resolution of an ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) instrument is arrival time jitter caused by amplitude and phase variation of radio frequency (RF) cavities. In this paper, we present a semi-analytical approach for calculating RF-induced temporal jitter from klystron and RF cavity parameters. Our approach allows fast estimation of temporal jitter for MeV-UED beamlines and can serve as a virtual timing tool when shot-to-shot measurements of RF amplitude and phase jitters are available. A simulation study for the SLAC MeV-UED instrument is presented and the temporal resolution for several beamline configurations are compared.</description>

      <title>Report on the Advanced Linear Collider Study Group (ALEGRO) Workshop 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The workshop focused on the application of ANAs to particle physics keeping in mind the ultimate goal of a collider at the energy frontier (10\,TeV, e$^+$/e$^-$, e$^-$/e$^-$, or $\gamma\gamma$). The development of ANAs is conducted at universities and national laboratories worldwide. The community is thematically broad and diverse, in particular since lasers suitable for ANA research (multi-hundred-terawatt peak power, a few tens of femtosecond-long pulses) and acceleration of electrons to hundreds of mega electron volts to multi giga electron volts became commercially available. The community spans several continents (Europe, America, Asia), including more than 62 laboratories in more than 20 countries. It is among the missions of the ICFA-ANA panel to feature the amazing progress made with ANAs, to provide international coordination and to foster international collaborations towards a future HEP collider. The scope of this edition of the workshop was to discuss the recent progress and necessary steps towards realizing a linear collider for particle physics based on novel-accelerator technologies (laser or beam driven in plasma or structures). Updates on the relevant aspects of the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) Roadmap Process as well as of the P5 (in the US) were presented, and ample time was dedicated to discussions. The major outcome of the workshop is the decision for ALEGRO to coordinate efforts in Europe, in the US, and in Asia towards a pre-CDR for an ANA-based, 10\,TeV CM collider. This goal of this coordination is to lead to a funding proposal to be submitted to both EU and EU/US funding agencies. This document presents a summary of the workshop, as seen by the co-chairs, as well as short 'one-pagers' written by the presenters at the workshop.</description>
