      <title>Unifying framework for non-Hermitian and Hermitian topology in driven-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal sensors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics of Electron Scattering from Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport, which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics, the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin transport.</description>

      <title>Electrical detection of magnons with nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present information and communication technologies are largely based on electronic devices, which suffer from heat generation and high power consumption. Alternatives like spintronics and magnonics, which harness the spin degree of freedom, offer compelling pathways to overcome these fundamental limitations of charge-based electronics. Magnonics relies on spin waves, the collective excitations of magnetic moments in magnetically ordered materials, to achieve processing and transport of information at microwave frequencies without relying on charge currents. However, efficient means for all-electrical, high-resolution, semiconductor-compatible readout of information encoded in spin waves are still missing. Here, we demonstrate the electrical detection of spin waves using a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) cell fabricated in a state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) production line. By engineering the dynamic coupling between spin waves and the magnetization state of the MTJ, we demonstrate transduction of spin-wave excitations into measurable electrical signals with high fidelity. Moreover, through these measurements, we find spectral line widths, associated with nonlinear processes, down to a few hundreds of kHz, which opens up new perspectives for spin waves as quantum transducers.</description>

      <title>Rapid Autotuning of a SiGe Quantum Dot into the Single-Electron Regime with Machine Learning and RF-Reflectometry FPGA-Based Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor. Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by harnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET), the measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8. This led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of a SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the Python code execution.</description>

      <title>Harmonic and Subharmonic Magnon Generation in a Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally observe the generation of magnon harmonics and subharmonics in an on-chip surface acoustic wave resonator incorporating a thin Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ film, using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering. In our devices, rotating the in-plane magnetic field allows continuous tuning of the magnon-phonon coupling from weak to strong within the same resonator. In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime, providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Projective crystal symmetry and topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states naturally represent symmetry groups, though often in a projective sense. Intriguingly, the projective nature of crystalline symmetries has remained underexplored until very recently. A series of groundbreaking theoretical and experimental studies have now brought this to light, demonstrating that projective representations of crystal symmetries lead to remarkable consequences in condensed matter physics and various artificial crystals, particularly in their connection to topological phenomena. In this article, we explain the basic ideas and notions underpinning these recent developments and share our perspective on this emerging research area. We specifically highlight that the appearance of momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetry is a unique feature of projective crystal symmetry representations. This, in turn, has the profound consequence of reducing the fundamental domain of momentum space to all possible flat compact manifolds, which include torus and Klein bottle in 2D and the ten platycosms in 3D, presenting a significantly richer landscape for topological structures than conventional settings. Finally, the ongoing efforts and promising future research directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Domain wall skyrmion-based magnonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnonic waveguide based on domain wall (DW) is considered as a crucial breakthrough toward the realization of magnonic nanocircuits. However, the effective control of spin waves propagating in DWs remains to be explored. Here, we construct a magnonic crystal (MC) by using a chain of the domain wall skyrmions (DWSKs) to manipulate the spin-wave propagation in DWs. We show that the DWSK chain can be created by leveraging voltage-controlled Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The DWSK-based MC opens magnonic bandgaps, which can be dynamically adjusted through magnetic fields modulating the DWSK size. Furthermore, the manipulation of spin waves by the DWSK-based MC maintains robust in curved DW, demonstrating its adaptability to complex device architectures. Our work provides an effective method to control the spin-wave propagation in DWs and paves the way for designing energy-efficient magnonic nanocircuits.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in three-dimensional PT- and PC-symmetric class CI band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a previously missing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for three-dimensional band structures in symmetry class CI defined by parity-time (PT) and parity-particle-hole (PC) symmetries. PT symmetry allows one to define a real Berry connection and, based on the $\eta$-invariant, a spin-Chern--Simons (spin-CS) action. We show that PC symmetry quantizes the spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Altermagnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-ohmic to ohmic crossover in the breakdown of the quantum Hall states in graphene under broadband excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of symmetry constraint in Floquet topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching behaviors in vertically aligned MoS$_2$ films with Cu, Ag, and Au electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing circuits can be realized using memristors based on low-dimensional materials enabling enhanced metal diffusion for resistive switching. Here, we investigate memristive properties of vertically aligned MoS$_2$ (VA-MoS$_2$) films with three different metal electrodes: Ag, Cu, and Au. Despite having the same active material, all three metals show distinct switching behavior, which are crucial for neuromorphic computing applications: Ag enables volatile switching, Cu demonstrates stable non-volatile switching with retention over 2500 s, and Au shows no memristive response. Cu devices show abrupt resistance changes, and significant increase of copper content upon biasing, indicative of stable non-volatile switching based on filament formation and rupture. About 85% of Ag and Cu devices exhibit reliable memristor behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into the memristive switching mechanism in VA-MoS$_2$ and present a promising avenue for facile fabrication of neuromorphic circuits by employing a set of different metals on a single active material.</description>

      <title>Non-universal localization transition in the quantum Hall effect probed through broken-symmetry states of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect hosts quantum phase transitions in which the localization length, that is the size of disorder-induced bulk localized states, is governed by universal scaling from percolation theory. However, this universal character is not systematically observed in experiments, including very recent ones in extremely clean devices. Here we explore this non-universality by systematically measuring the localization length in broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene. Depending on the nature and gap size of these states, we observe differences of up to a tenfold in the minimum localization length, accompanied by clear deviations from universal scaling. Our results, as well as the previously observed non-universality, are fully captured by a simple picture based on the co-existence of localized states from two successive sub-Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Effects of correlated hopping on thermoelectric response of a quantum dot strongly coupled to ferromagnetic leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of correlated hopping on thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Using the accurate numerical renormalization group method, we analyze the transport characteristics, focusing on the interplay between electronic correlations, spin-dependent transport processes, and thermoelectric response. We calculate the electrical conductance and thermopower as functions of the dot energy level, lead polarization, and the amplitude of correlated hopping. Moreover, we analyze the effect of competing correlations on the Kondo resonance and discuss the asymmetry of conductance peaks under the influence of the exchange field. We demonstrate that the presence of correlated hopping is responsible for asymmetric spin-dependent transport characteristics. Our results provide valuable insight into how correlated hopping affects spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric efficiency in quantum dot systems with ferromagnetic contacts.</description>

      <title>Introduction to some of the simplest topological phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes explain the classification of some simple fermionic topological phases of matter in a pedestrian manner, with an aim to be maximally pedagogical = doing things in excruciating detail. We focus on a many-body perspective, even if many of the models we work with are non-interacting. We start out with symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of free fermions that are protected by U(1) symmetry = topological insulators. We then look at fermion topological phases that don't even need a symmetry = topological superconductors, and explain how their classification changes in presence of spinless time-reversal symmetry. We close by perturbatively checking which of the 1D topological phases we had found are stable to interactions.</description>

      <title>A General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moir\'e Systems: Application to Rhombohedral Pentalayer Graphene/hBN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to moir\'e superlattice consisted of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at moir\'e filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields. The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant, justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>The orbital-driven topological phase transition and planar Hall responses in ternary tellurides Weyl semi-metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we study electronic properties of the ternary tellurides TaXTe$_4$ (X=Rh, Ir) using density functional theory and investigate chiral anomaly mediated planar Hall response from ab initio calculations. We show that TaRhTe$_4$ is a hybrid Weyl semimetal (WSM), hosting Weyl points (WPs) of both type-I, type-II, while TaIrTe$_4$ is a type-II WSM as it hosts only type-II WPs with spin-orbit couplings (SOC). All WPs lie in the $k_z=0$ plane, and remain well-separated in both momentum and energy landscape. We observe long Fermi arcs connecting Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. We report both SOC and orbital driven topological phase transition in ternary tellurides. TaIrTe$_4$ undergoes topological phase transition under SOC. Whereas orbital driven topological phase transition due to d$_{xz}$ orbital has been observed in TaRhTe$_4$ even without SOC. Furthermore, the evolution of the band structures and the annihilation of WPs due to d$_{xz}$-Ir/Rh orbitals associated with the phase transitions in TaXTe$_4$ are also discussed. This systematic study opens new routes for engineering topological materials relying beyond strong SOC and sheds light on the possible role of correlation effects originating from orbital orbital degree of freedoms in tellurides. We further report an enhancement of planar Hall effects due to orbital driven topological phase transition in TaXTe$_4$ and we make resort to a tight-binding model to correlate the above findings with the effective mass anisotropy in different types of WSMs.</description>

      <title>How to Identify Suitable Gate Dielectrics for Transistors based on Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent progress in nanosheet transistors has established two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors as viable candidates for future ultra-scaled electronic devices. Next to reducing contact resistance, identifying good gate dielectrics is a fundamental challenge, as the dielectric/channel interface dramatically impacts virtually all performance parameters. While several promising gate dielectrics have recently been reported, the evaluation of their quality and suitability is often fragmentary and focused on selected important performance metrics of the gate stack, such as the capacitive gate control, leakage currents, reliability, and ease of fabrication and integration. However, identifying a suitable gate stack is a complex problem that has not yet been approached systematically. In this perspective, we aim to formulate general criteria for good gate dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electro-Optic Kerr Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a previously overlooked contribution to the electro-optic Kerr rotation of reflected light, arising from the interplay of matter, the static electric field, and the magnetic component of light. Remarkably, this mechanism dominates in isotropic nonmagnetic homogeneous metals. We derive analytical expressions for the Kerr rotation in both two-dimensional layers and semi-infinite systems. Within the relaxation-time approximation, we predict experimentally accessible signal magnitudes. This intrinsic mechanism thereby opens new opportunities for probing electronic properties in materials through Kerr spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the magnetic behavior of C$_{\rm3}$N$_{\rm4}$ 2D material by defect creation, defect passivation, and transition metal adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the density functional tight binding method (DFTB) and the GFN1-xTB (Geometries, Frequencies, and Noncovalent interactions Tight Binding) Hamiltonian, we have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of vacancy defects, hydrogen and oxygen passivated defects, and Fe adsorption in two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (gt-C$_3$N$_4$) 2D material. The ring shape is the most preferred vacancy evolution path, with significant stability of the semicircle fourfold C-N-C-N vacancy. We found that bare gt-C$_3$N$_4$ which is non-magnetic becomes magnetic by 2-, and 5-defects creation, hydrogen/oxygen passivation of the defects, and upon Fe adsorption. Interestingly, Fe atoms interact with the gt-C$_3$N$_4$ sheet and result in a ground ferromagnetic (FM) state. In addition, we investigate the effects of passivating the vacancies by hydrogen in gt-C$_3$N$_4$ on its structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. We found that substituting the 1, 2, and 3 vacancies with hydrogen and passivating the 6-defect with oxygen turns on magnetism in the system. Due to structural distortion, the passivated defects do not have a well-ordered magnetic orientation. However, passivating the remaining defected structures maintains the nonmagnetic state. It is also shown that passivation leads to a semiconductor with a band gap value higher than that of the bare material. We also calculate the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal (TM) atoms, including V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni-adsorbed gt-C$_3$N$_4$ monolayer. All TM atoms show slight lattice distortion, and the adsorbed system almost maintains the original structure type. Moreover, a FM alignment was observed with a total magnetic moments of 2.89 $\mu_B$, 2 $\mu_B$, and 1 $\mu_B$ for V, Fe, and Co atoms, respectively. The Cr, Mn, and Ni atoms induce no magnetism to the non magnetic gt-C$_3$N$_4$ system.</description>

      <title>Effects of time-periodic drive in the linear response for planar-Hall set-ups with Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of a time-periodic drive on three-dimensional Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals in planar-Hall/planar-thermal-Hall set-ups. The drive is modelled here by circularly-polarized electromagnetic fields, whose effects are incorporated by a combination of the Floquet theorem and the van Vleck perturbation theory, applicable in the high-frequency limit. We evaluate the longitudinal and in-plane transverse components of the linear-response coefficients using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, thereby demonstrating the explicit analytical expressions of the conductivity for large frequencies. Our results corroborate the fact that the topological charges of the corresponding semimetals etch their trademark signatures in these transport properties, which can be detected in appropriate experiments.</description>

      <title>Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk (surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material, finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.</description>

      <title>Optical theorem and generalized energy conservation for scattering of time-modulated waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized energy conservation relation for scattering of time-modulated waves, where conventional energy conservation does not hold. Based on this relation, we derive an optical theorem and compute the active power describing the power input or output due to scattering. Notably, the same system may be subject to energy gain, energy loss, or energy conservation depending on the frequency harmonics present in the wave field. Moreover, we show how the optical theorem derived herein may be used for image reconstruction based on measurements of the power. In particular, such measurements do not require information about the phase of the scattered field.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>
