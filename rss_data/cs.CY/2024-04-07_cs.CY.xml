      <title>A Conceptual Design of In-Game Real and Virtual Currency Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gaming industry is earning huge revenues from incorporating virtual currencies into the game design experience. Even if it is a useful approach for the game industry to boost up their earnings, the unidirectional and bidirectional in-game virtual currencies can invoke inadequate gaming behaviors and additions among players. The market lacks gaming and customer protection regulations to avoid the financial, behavioral, and psychological exploitation of users. Therefore, it is needed to develop visual or textual interface design recommendations that help the game players keep balance in their spending and improve their gaming behavior. This paper presents a conceptual design of an in-game purchasing module that allows the user to observe their real time spendings in relation to virtual currency buying.</description>

      <title>On the Quest for Effectiveness in Human Oversight: Interdisciplinary Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human oversight is currently discussed as a potential safeguard to counter some of the negative aspects of high-risk AI applications. This prompts a critical examination of the role and conditions necessary for what is prominently termed effective or meaningful human oversight of these systems. This paper investigates effective human oversight by synthesizing insights from psychological, legal, philosophical, and technical domains. Based on the claim that the main objective of human oversight is risk mitigation, we propose a viable understanding of effectiveness in human oversight: for human oversight to be effective, the human overseer has to have (a) sufficient causal power with regards to the system and its effects, (b) suitable epistemic access to relevant aspects of the situation, (c) self-control over their own actions, and (d) fitting intentions for their role. Furthermore, we argue that this is equivalent to saying that a human overseer is effective if and only if they are morally responsible and have fitting intentions. Against this backdrop, we suggest facilitators and inhibitors of effectiveness in human oversight when striving for practical applicability. We discuss factors in three domains, namely, the technical design of the system, individual factors of human overseers, and the environmental circumstances in which the overseer operates. Finally, this paper scrutinizes the upcoming AI Act of the European Union -- in particular Article 14 on Human Oversight -- as an exemplary regulatory framework in which we study the practicality of our understanding of effective human oversight. By analyzing the provisions and implications of the European AI Act proposal, we pinpoint in how far that proposal aligns with our analyses regarding effective human oversight as well as how it might get enriched by our conceptual understanding of effectiveness in human oversight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Launched by Elon Musk and its Optimus, we are witnessing a new race in which many companies have already engaged. The objective it to put at work a new generation of humanoid robots in demanding industrial environments within 2 or 3 years. Is this objective realistic ? The aim of this document and its main contributions is to provide some hints by covering the following topics: First an analysis of 12 companies based on eight criteria that will help us to distinguish companies based on their maturity and approach to the market; second as these humanoids are very complex systems we will provide an overview of the technological challenges to be addressed; third when humanoids are deployed at scale, Operation and Maintenance become critical and the we will explore what is new with these complex machines; Finally Pilots are the last step to test the feasibility of a new system before mass deployment. This is an important step to test the maturity of a product and the strategy of the humanoid supplier to address a market and two pragmatic approaches will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Securing Social Spaces: Harnessing Deep Learning to Eradicate Cyberbullying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital world, cyberbullying is a serious problem that can harm the mental and physical health of people who use social media. This paper explains just how serious cyberbullying is and how it really affects indi-viduals exposed to it. It also stresses how important it is to find better ways to detect cyberbullying so that online spaces can be safer. Plus, it talks about how making more accurate tools to spot cyberbullying will be really helpful in the future. Our paper introduces a deep learning-based ap-proach, primarily employing BERT and BiLSTM architectures, to effective-ly address cyberbullying. This approach is designed to analyse large vol-umes of posts and predict potential instances of cyberbullying in online spaces. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the hateBERT model, an extension of BERT focused on hate speech detection, among the five mod-els, achieving an accuracy rate of 89.16%. This research is a significant con-tribution to "Computational Intelligence for Social Transformation," prom-ising a safer and more inclusive digital landscape.</description>

      <title>Cultural influence on autonomous vehicles acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and other intelligent transport systems have been evolving rapidly and are being increasingly deployed worldwide. Previous work has shown that perceptions of autonomous vehicles and attitudes towards them depend on various attributes, including the respondent's age, education level and background. These findings with respect to age and educational level are generally uniform, such as showing that younger respondents are typically more accepting of autonomous vehicles, as are those with higher education levels. However the influence of factors such as culture are much less clear cut. In this paper we analyse the relationship between acceptance of autonomous vehicles and national culture by means of the well-known Hofstede cultural model.</description>

      <title>An Investigation into Misuse of Java Security APIs by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing trend of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation raises the question of their capability to generate trustworthy code. While many researchers are exploring the utility of code generation for uncovering software vulnerabilities, one crucial but often overlooked aspect is the security Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs play an integral role in upholding software security, yet effectively integrating security APIs presents substantial challenges. This leads to inadvertent misuse by developers, thereby exposing software to vulnerabilities. To overcome these challenges, developers may seek assistance from LLMs. In this paper, we systematically assess ChatGPT's trustworthiness in code generation for security API use cases in Java. To conduct a thorough evaluation, we compile an extensive collection of 48 programming tasks for 5 widely used security APIs. We employ both automated and manual approaches to effectively detect security API misuse in the code generated by ChatGPT for these tasks. Our findings are concerning: around 70% of the code instances across 30 attempts per task contain security API misuse, with 20 distinct misuse types identified. Moreover, for roughly half of the tasks, this rate reaches 100%, indicating that there is a long way to go before developers can rely on ChatGPT to securely implement security API code.</description>

      <title>An ExplainableFair Framework for Prediction of Substance Use Disorder Treatment Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness of machine learning models in healthcare has drawn increasing attention from clinicians, researchers, and even at the highest level of government. On the other hand, the importance of developing and deploying interpretable or explainable models has been demonstrated, and is essential to increasing the trustworthiness and likelihood of adoption of these models. The objective of this study was to develop and implement a framework for addressing both these issues - fairness and explainability. We propose an explainable fairness framework, first developing a model with optimized performance, and then using an in-processing approach to mitigate model biases relative to the sensitive attributes of race and sex. We then explore and visualize explanations of the model changes that lead to the fairness enhancement process through exploring the changes in importance of features. Our resulting-fairness enhanced models retain high sensitivity with improved fairness and explanations of the fairness-enhancement that may provide helpful insights for healthcare providers to guide clinical decision-making and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Increasing Fairness in Classification of Out of Distribution Data for Facial Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard classification theory assumes that the distribution of images in the test and training sets are identical. Unfortunately, real-life scenarios typically feature unseen data ("out-of-distribution data") which is different from data in the training distribution("in-distribution"). This issue is most prevalent in social justice problems where data from under-represented groups may appear in the test data without representing an equal proportion of the training data. This may result in a model returning confidently wrong decisions and predictions. We are interested in the following question: Can the performance of a neural network improve on facial images of out-of-distribution data when it is trained simultaneously on multiple datasets of in-distribution data? We approach this problem by incorporating the Outlier Exposure model and investigate how the model's performance changes when other datasets of facial images were implemented. We observe that the accuracy and other metrics of the model can be increased by applying Outlier Exposure, incorporating a trainable weight parameter to increase the machine's emphasis on outlier images, and by re-weighting the importance of different class labels. We also experimented with whether sorting the images and determining outliers via image features would have more of an effect on the metrics than sorting by average pixel value. Our goal was to make models not only more accurate but also more fair by scanning a more expanded range of images. We also tested the datasets in reverse order to see whether a more fair dataset with balanced features has an effect on the model's accuracy.</description>

      <title>Validation of critical maneuvers based on shared control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the validation of shared control strategies for critical maneuvers in automated driving systems. Shared control involves collaboration between the driver and automation, allowing both parties to actively engage and cooperate at different levels of the driving task. The involvement of the driver adds complexity to the control loop, necessitating comprehensive validation methodologies. The proposed approach focuses on two critical maneuvers: overtaking in low visibility scenarios and lateral evasive actions. A modular architecture with an arbitration module and shared control algorithms is implemented, primarily focusing on the lateral control of the vehicle. The validation is conducted using a dynamic simulator, involving 8 real drivers interacting with a virtual environment. The results demonstrate improved safety and user acceptance, indicating the effectiveness of the shared control strategies in comparison with no shared-control support. Future work involves implementing shared control in drive-by-wire systems to enhance safety and driver comfort during critical maneuvers. Overall, this research contributes to the development and validation of shared control approaches in automated driving systems.</description>

      <title>Willkommens-Merkel, Chaos-Johnson, and Tore-Klose: Modeling the Evaluative Meaning of German Personal Name Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational study of the under-investigated phenomenon of personal name compounds (PNCs) in German such as Willkommens-Merkel ('Welcome-Merkel'). Prevalent in news, social media, and political discourse, PNCs are hypothesized to exhibit an evaluative function that is reflected in a more positive or negative perception as compared to the respective personal full name (such as Angela Merkel). We model 321 PNCs and their corresponding full names at discourse level, and show that PNCs bear an evaluative nature that can be captured through a variety of computational methods. Specifically, we assess through valence information whether a PNC is more positively or negatively evaluative than the person's name, by applying and comparing two approaches using (i) valence norms and (ii) pretrained language models (PLMs). We further enrich our data with personal, domain-specific, and extra-linguistic information and perform a range of regression analyses revealing that factors including compound and modifier valence, domain, and political party membership influence how a PNC is evaluated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of ChatGPT as a supportive tool in education, notably in programming courses, addresses the unique challenges of programming education by providing assistance with debugging, code generation, and explanations. Despite existing research validating ChatGPT's effectiveness, its application in university-level programming education and a detailed understanding of student interactions and perspectives remain limited. This paper explores ChatGPT's impact on learning in a Python programming course tailored for first-year students over eight weeks. By analyzing responses from surveys, open-ended questions, and student-ChatGPT dialog data, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of ChatGPT's utility and identify both its advantages and limitations as perceived by students. Our study uncovers a generally positive reception toward ChatGPT and offers insights into its role in enhancing the programming education experience. These findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI's potential in education, suggesting paths for future research and application.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Learning, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence in Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a multi dimensional view of AI's role in learning and education, emphasizing the intricate interplay between AI, analytics, and the learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualization of AI as stochastic tools, as exemplified in generative AI, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the cognitive diversity inherent in AI algorithms, and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education research, which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualizations of AI in education: the externalization of human cognition, the internalization of AI models to influence human thought processes, and the extension of human cognition via tightly integrated human-AI systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for education, as well as the perils of overemphasis on externalising human cognition as exemplified in today's hype surrounding generative AI tools. The paper concludes with an advocacy for a broader educational approach that includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI enabled world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current landscape of online abuses and harms, effective content moderation is necessary to cultivate safe and inclusive online spaces. Yet, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is still unclear. Here, we assess the effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive deplatforming operation that affected nearly 2,000 communities on Reddit. By analyzing 16M comments posted by 17K users during 14 months, we provide nuanced results on the effects, both desired and otherwise, of the ban. Among our main findings is that 15.6% of the affected users left Reddit and that those who remained reduced their toxicity by 6.6% on average. The ban also caused 5% users to increase their toxicity by more than 70% of their pre-ban level. Overall, our multifaceted results provide new insights into the efficacy of deplatforming. As such, our findings can inform the development of future moderation interventions and the policing of online platforms.</description>

      <title>Survey of Computerized Adaptive Testing: A Machine Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) provides an efficient and tailored method for assessing the proficiency of examinees, by dynamically adjusting test questions based on their performance. Widely adopted across diverse fields like education, healthcare, sports, and sociology, CAT has revolutionized testing practices. While traditional methods rely on psychometrics and statistics, the increasing complexity of large-scale testing has spurred the integration of machine learning techniques. This paper aims to provide a machine learning-focused survey on CAT, presenting a fresh perspective on this adaptive testing method. By examining the test question selection algorithm at the heart of CAT's adaptivity, we shed light on its functionality. Furthermore, we delve into cognitive diagnosis models, question bank construction, and test control within CAT, exploring how machine learning can optimize these components. Through an analysis of current methods, strengths, limitations, and challenges, we strive to develop robust, fair, and efficient CAT systems. By bridging psychometric-driven CAT research with machine learning, this survey advocates for a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to the future of adaptive testing.</description>
