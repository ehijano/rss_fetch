      <title>The {\em 4DLO} and other tubing models of $S^3$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em Four-dimensional Light Orchestra} or { \em 4DLO} was an interactive sculpture at the National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) from November 20, 2025 through January 2026, illustrating various sub-symmetries of the 24-cell with colored lights, part of a larger sequence of tubing sculptures aiming to bring to life a few lines of tables appearing in Conway and Smith (2002), reprinted in {\em The Symmetries of Things}. Best of all museum patrons could manipulate {\em 4DLO}'s lighting by singing and making funny noises into a microphone, and they did with gusto. Here we describe some of the technical aspects of this sculpture and its context.</description>

      <title>Simone Weil, Andr{\'e} Weil, Bourbaki and Pythagorean mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simone Weil is one of the most prominent 20th century French philosophers. She is the sister of Andr{\'e} Weil, the renowned mathematician, the father of modern algebraic geometry and the initiator of the Bourbaki group. Simone and Andr{\'e} Weil shared a love for literature, mathematics, science and philosophy. My aim in this article is to convey, based on their writings and their correspondence, the idea that Pythagoreanism was a central element of their thought. I will put this into context, talking first about the life and work of each of them, showing how much they were linked by essential common ideas, even though their life paths were very different, and how, ultimately, Pythagorean mathematics and philosophy became naturally part of their respective intellectual worlds. The article is the written version of a lecture I gave in October 2025, at the conference ``The Life and Contribution of Pythagoras to Mathematics, Sciences, and Philosophy'' that took place on October 3-4, 2025 at the Cyprus University of Technology in Limassol.</description>

      <title>The double gamma function and Vladimir Alekseevsky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is about a forgotten function and a forgotten mathematician. The double gamma function is now an important special function, which appears for different reasons in many branches of mathematics and in mathematical physics, as it satisfies a large and amusing collection of identities parallel to the classical gamma function. It was discovered and investigated in detail by Vladimir Alekseevsky in 1888-89. We outline his starting point here: considering the Weierstrass product for the entire periodic function $\sin \pi x$ and taking half of the factors corresponding to non-positive roots of the sine, we obtain the function $1/\Gamma(x)$. Considering the Weierstrass product for the doubly quasiperiodic Jacobi theta function $\vartheta_1$ and taking the half of factors we come to the $q$-gamma function (which appears, with a slight change in notation, in Eduard Heine's work). Considering the quarter of the factors (corresponding to the positive quadrant in the lattice $n_1\omega+n_2\omega_2$ of periods), Alekseevsky arrived at his double gamma function. The work in this direction was continued by Ernest Barnes, Jean Beaupin, Godfrey Hardy, and Vladimir Steklov in 1899--1907. After 1907, publications on this topic stopped, and the double gamma appeared again 70 years later due to Takuro Shintani. In this paper we discuss Alekseevsky's seminal work and its genesis, the history of the double gamma, and Alekseevsky's biography (1858-1916).</description>

      <title>AI for Mathematics: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) has emerged as a distinct field that leverages machine learning to navigate mathematical landscapes historically intractable for early symbolic systems. While mid-20th-century symbolic approaches successfully automated formal logic, they faced severe scalability limitations due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. The recent integration of data-driven approaches has revitalized this pursuit. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of AI4Math, highlighting its primary focus on developing AI models to support mathematical research. Crucially, we emphasize that this is not merely the application of AI to mathematical activities; it also encompasses the development of stronger AI systems where the rigorous nature of mathematics serves as a premier testbed for advancing general reasoning capabilities. We categorize existing research into two complementary directions: problem-specific modeling, involving the design of specialized architectures for distinct mathematical tasks, and general-purpose modeling, focusing on foundation models capable of broader reasoning, retrieval, and exploratory workflows. We conclude by discussing key challenges and prospects, advocating for AI systems that go beyond facilitating formal correctness to enabling the discovery of meaningful results and unified theories, recognizing that the true value of a proof lies in the insights and tools it offers to the broader mathematical landscape.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of the Squircle-Lemniscate Relation and Keplerian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>
