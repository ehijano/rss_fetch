      <title>Neural Downscaling for Complex Systems: from Large-scale to Small-scale by Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting and understanding the chaotic dynamics in complex systems is essential in various applications. However, conventional approaches, whether full-scale simulations or small-scale omissions, fail to offer a comprehensive solution. This instigates exploration into whether modeling or omitting small-scale dynamics could benefit from the well-captured large-scale dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology called Neural Downscaling (ND), which integrates neural operator techniques with the principles of inertial manifold and nonlinear Galerkin theory. ND effectively infers small-scale dynamics within a complementary subspace from corresponding large-scale dynamics well-represented in a low-dimensional space. The effectiveness and generalization of the method are demonstrated on the complex systems governed by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and Navier-Stokes equations. As the first comprehensive deterministic model targeting small-scale dynamics, ND sheds light on the intricate spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics of complex systems, revealing how small-scale dynamics are intricately linked with and influenced by large-scale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interspecific dispersal constraints suppress pattern formation in metacommunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decisions to disperse from a habitat stand out among organismal behaviors as pivotal drivers of ecosystem dynamics across scales. Encounters with other species are an important component of adaptive decision-making in dispersal, resulting in widespread behaviors like tracking resources or avoiding consumers in space. Despite this, metacommunity models often treat dispersal as a function of intraspecific density alone. We show, focusing initially on three-species network motifs, that interspecific dispersal rules generally drive a transition in metacommunities from homogeneous steady states to self-organized heterogeneous spatial patterns. However, when ecologically realistic constraints reflecting adaptive behaviors are imposed -- prey tracking and predator avoidance -- a pronounced homogenizing effect emerges where spatial pattern formation is suppressed. We demonstrate this effect for each motif by computing master stability functions that separate the contributions of local and spatial interactions to pattern formation. We extend this result to species rich food webs using a random matrix approach, where we find that eventually webs become large enough to override the homogenizing effect of adaptive dispersal behaviors, leading once again to predominately pattern forming dynamics. Our results emphasize the critical role of interspecific dispersal rules in shaping spatial patterns across landscapes, highlighting the need to incorporate adaptive behavioral constraints in efforts to link local species interactions and metacommunity structure.</description>

      <title>Network bottlenecks and task structure control the evolution of interpretable learning rules in a foraging agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing reliable mechanisms for continuous local learning is a central challenge faced by biological and artificial systems. Yet, how the environmental factors and structural constraints on the learning network influence the optimal plasticity mechanisms remains obscure even for simple settings. To elucidate these dependencies, we study meta-learning via evolutionary optimization of simple reward-modulated plasticity rules in embodied agents solving a foraging task. We show that unconstrained meta-learning leads to the emergence of diverse plasticity rules. However, regularization and bottlenecks to the model help reduce this variability, resulting in interpretable rules. Our findings indicate that the meta-learning of plasticity rules is very sensitive to various parameters, with this sensitivity possibly reflected in the learning rules found in biological networks. When included in models, these dependencies can be used to discover potential objective functions and details of biological learning via comparisons with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Universality of critical dynamics on a complex network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00092</link>

Abstract: We investigate the role of the spectral dimension $d_s$ in determining the universality of phase transitions on a complex network. Due to its structural heterogeneity, a complex network generally acts as a disordered system. Specifically, we study the synchronization and entrainment transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of the Kuramoto model and the phase transition of the equilibrium dynamics of the classical $XY$ model, thereby covering a broad spectrum from nonlinear dynamics to statistical and condensed matter physics. Using linear theory, we obtain a general relationship between the dynamics occurring on the network and the underlying network properties. This yields the lower critical spectral dimension of the phase synchronization and entrainment transitions in the Kuramoto model as $d_s=4$ and $d_s=2$ respectively, whereas for the phase transition in the $XY$ model it is $d_s=2$. To test our theoretical hypotheses, we employ a network where any two nodes on the network are connected with a probability proportional to a power law of the distance between the nodes; this realizes any desired $d_s\in [1, \infty)$. Our detailed numerical study agrees well with the prediction of linear theory for the phase synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model. However, it shows a clear entrainment transition in the Kuramoto model and phase transition in the $XY$ model at $d_s \gtrsim 3$, not $d_s=2$ as predicted by linear theory. Our study indicates that network disorder in the region $2 \leq d_s \lesssim 3$ introduces strong finite-size fluctuations, which makes it extremely difficult to probe the existence of the ordered phase as predicted, affecting the dynamics profoundly.</description>
