      <title>Defect Interactions Through Periodic Boundaries in Two-Dimensional $p$-atics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic boundary conditions are a common tool used to emulate effectively infinite domains. However, two-dimensional periodic domains are topologically distinct from the infinite plane, eliciting the question: How do periodic boundaries affect systems with topological properties themselves? In this work, I derive an analytical expression for the orientation fields of two-dimensional $p$-atic liquid crystals, systems with $p$-fold rotational symmetry, with topological defects in a flat domain subject to periodic boundary conditions in two-dimensions. I show that this orientation field leads to an anomalous interaction between defects that deviates from the usual Coulomb interaction, which is confirmed through continuum simulations of nematic liquid crystals ($p = 2$). The interaction is understood as being mediated by non-singular topological solitons in the director field which are stabilized by the periodic boundary conditions. The results show the importance of considering domain topology, not only geometry, when analyzing interactions between topological defects.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Data-Driven Discovery for Constitutive Modeling of Compressible, Nonlinear, History-Dependent Soft Materials under Multiaxial Cyclic Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general hybrid physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling nonlinear, history-dependent viscoelastic behavior under multiaxial cyclic loading. The approach is built on a generalized internal state variable-based visco-hyperelastic constitutive formulation, where stress is decomposed into volumetric, isochoric hyperelastic, and isochoric viscoelastic components. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models the equilibrium response, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units capture time-dependent viscoelastic effects. Physical constraints, including objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency, are enforced to ensure physically valid predictions. After developing the general form of the surrogate model based on tensor integrity bases and response functions, we employed the nonlinear Holzapfel differential viscoelastic model to generate training data. Two datasets, one for short-term and another for long-term relaxation, are constructed to span a wide range of material memory characteristics. The model is trained and tested under diverse multiaxial loading conditions, including different stretch levels applied independently in the longitudinal and transverse directions, varying strain rates, and both tension and compression states, even beyond the training domain. Energy dissipation is explicitly analyzed at different strain rates for both datasets to verify thermodynamic consistency through the second law. The results show that the proposed framework accurately captures complex, nonlinear, and rate-dependent material responses. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness to synthetic noise, enabling generalizable and physically consistent predictions under realistic and variable loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stress Softening Damage in Strongly Nonlinear Viscoelastic Soft Materials A Physics Informed Data Driven Constitutive Model with Time Temperature Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel physics informed, data-driven modeling framework for capturing the strongly nonlinear thermo-viscoelastic behavior of soft materials exhibiting stress softening, with emphasis on the Mullins effect. Unlike previous approaches limited to quasi-static or isothermal conditions, our model unifies rate dependence, temperature sensitivity, large strain cyclic loading, and evolving damage mechanisms. Thermodynamic admissibility is ensured via a custom loss function that embeds the Clausius Duhem inequality and explicitly constrains the damage variable for physically realistic softening. A Temporal Convolutional Network is trained on high fidelity experimental data across multiple temperatures, strain rates, and stretch levels, enabling the model to capture rich thermomechanical coupling and history dependence. The framework generalizes to unseen thermo mechanical conditions, higher strain rates, and larger deformations, and remains robust to input noise. Validation against finite element simulations using Abaqus/Explicit demonstrates excellent agreement under cyclic loading and damage evolution, confirming the surrogate models effectiveness for advanced simulation workflows.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity near jamming transition over a wide range of bidispersity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate hyperuniformity in two-dimensional frictionless jammed packings of bidisperse systems. Hyperuniformity is characterized by the suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales, and the structure factor asymptotically vanishes in the small-wavenumber limit as $S(q) \propto q^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha &gt; 0$. It is well known that jammed configurations exhibit hyperuniformity over a wide range of wavenumbers windows, down to $q^{\ast}\sigma \approx 0.2$, where $\sigma$ is the particle diameter. In two dimensions, we find that the exponent $\alpha$ is approximately $0.6\text{--}0.7$. This contrasts with the reported value of $\alpha = 1$ for three-dimensional systems. We employ an advanced method recently introduced by Rissone \textit{et al.} \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.038001}{[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 038001 (2021)]}, originally developed for monodisperse and three-dimensional systems, to determine $\alpha$ with high precision. This exponent is found to be unchanged for all size ratios between small and large particles, except in the monodisperse case, where the system crystallizes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Rotation of a Symmetric Inclusion in Chiral Active Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a circular passive inclusion, termed a torquer, in a bath of chiral active Brownian particles. Despite being geometrically symmetric and non-motile, the torquer exhibits persistent rotation due to spatially inhomogeneous torques arising from angularly biased collisions with active particles. This interaction-driven symmetry breaking does not rely on shape anisotropy or external forcing. Through simulations, we identify two distinct regimes of rotation: one dominated by density gradients at low chirality, and another by increased impact frequency at high chirality. Our results highlight how nonequilibrium interactions in chiral active media can induce motion in symmetric objects, offering a new perspective on symmetry breaking in active systems.</description>

      <title>Banding and polarization in driven multistable materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a disordered network of bistable bonds subjected to periodic strain. The model is inspired by experiments on crumpled sheets and it features behaviors associated with glasses, including a complex energy landscape, memories, and large avalanches. At small strain amplitudes, the system quickly converges to a limit cycle where the system repeatedly cycles between a set of states. At large amplitudes, motion is erratic and does not converge to a limit cycle. The transition appears to be continuous, with diverging time scales. The nature of instabilities is different on both sides of the transition. At small strain amplitudes, instabilities are correlated only over a finite distance. Above the transition, instabilities are localized along diagonal bands. The distance between bands grows near the transition and appears to diverge. We propose a simple model that explains these observations. Below the transition, we propose a new ``order parameter'' -- the polarization of the instabilities along the driving direction.</description>

      <title>Machine learning many-body potentials for charged colloids in primitive 1:1 electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective interactions between charged particles dispersed in an electrolyte are most commonly modeled using the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) potential, where the ions in the suspension are coarse-grained out at mean-field level. However, several experiments point to shortcomings of this theory, as the distribution of ions surrounding colloids is governed by nontrivial correlations in regimes of strong Coulomb coupling (e.g. low temperature, low dielectric constant, high ion valency, high surface charge). Insight can be gained by explicitly including the ions in simulations of these colloidal suspensions, even though direct simulations of dispersions of highly charged spheres are computationally demanding. To circumvent slow equilibration, we employ a machine-learning (ML) framework to generate ML potentials that accurately describe the effective colloid interactions. These ML potentials enable fast simulations and make large-scale simulations of charged colloids in suspension possible, opening the possibility for a systematic study of their phase behaviour, in particular gas-liquid and fluid-solid coexistence.</description>

      <title>Designing binary mixtures of colloidal particles with simple interactions that assemble complex crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational methods for designing interactions between colloidal particles that induce self-assembly have received much attention for their promise to discover tailored materials. However, it often remains a challenge to translate computationally designed interactions to experiments because they may have features that are too complex, or even infeasible, to physically realize. Toward bridging this gap, we leverage relative-entropy minimization to design pair potentials for binary mixtures of colloidal particles that assemble crystal superlattices. We reduce the dimensionality and extent of the interaction design space by enforcing constraints on the form and parametrization of the pair potentials that are physically motivated by DNA-functionalized nanoparticles. We show that several two- and three-dimensional lattices, including honeycomb and cubic diamond, can be assembled using simple interactions despite their complex structures. We also find that the initial conditions used for the designed parameters as well as the assembly protocol play important roles in determining the outcome and success of the assembly process.</description>

      <title>Impact of particle-size polydispersity on the quality of thin-film colloidal crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Size polydispersity in colloidal particles can disrupt order in their self-assembly, ultimately leading to a complete suppression of crystallization. In contrast to various computational studies, few experimental studies systematically address the effects of size polydispersity on the quality of colloidal crystals. We present an experimental study of structural order in thin films of crystals vertically dried from colloidal dispersions with a systematically varying polydispersity. As expected, an increase in polydispersity leads to a deterioration in order with significant drops in the local bond-orientational order at 8% and 12% polydispersity. Our results align with previously suggested models of epitaxial-like growth of 2D layers during convective assembly. Our results can offer critical insights into the permissible limits for achieving colloidal crystals from more polydisperse systems such as those synthesized through more sustainable methods.</description>

      <title>TinyDEM: Minimal open granular DEM code with sliding, rolling and twisting friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces TinyDEM, a lightweight implementation of a full-fledged discrete element method (DEM) solver in 3D. Newton's damped equations of motion are solved explicitly for translations and rotations of a polydisperse ensemble of dry, soft, granular spherical particles, using quaternions to represent their orientation in space without gimbal lock. Particle collisions are modeled as inelastic and frictional, including full exchange of torque. With a general particle-mesh collision routine, complex rigid geometries can be simulated. TinyDEM is designed to be a compact standalone program written in simple C++11, devoid of explicit pointer arithmetics and advanced concepts such as manual memory management or polymorphism. It is parallelized with OpenMP and published freely under the 3-clause BSD license. TinyDEM can serve as an entry point into classical DEM simulations or as a foundation for more complex models of particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>When $B_2$ is Not Enough: Evaluating Simple Metrics for Predicting Phase Separation of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological processes. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex dependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the propensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific metrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second virial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure density. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this data to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive performance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective strengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a broadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and accuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across both phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this metric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties for IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond binary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior or predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.</description>

      <title>Non-coalescence and in-plane momentum generation in sessile droplet clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intuitively, droplets in proximity merge when brought into contact. However, under certain conditions, they may not coalesce due to the entrapment of an interstitial gas film. Non-coalescence between water droplets has so far been observed during collisions of droplets moving with relative centroidal velocity, or in the presence of specific enabling effects such as high intervening gas pressures, surfactants, or large droplet sizes (diameter $\gtrsim 1~\mathrm{mm}$). Here, we report non-coalescence between water droplets over a much wider range of droplet diameters, from millimeters to as small as 100 microns, without the need for any of the above factors. Such non-coalescence occurs in sessile droplet clusters on water-repellent surfaces. When any two droplets in a cluster coalesce, the evolving interface of the coalescing droplets comes in apparent contact with other neighbouring droplets in the cluster, but does not necessarily trigger further coalescence. In fact, such apparent contact can manifest as a bouncing interaction, and depending on the initial geometric arrangement of droplets, it can result in significant lateral momentum generation, consequently leading to spontaneous in-plane self-propulsion of the participating droplets. The energy conversion efficiency of this process reaches as high as 9\% for closely packed clusters of three sessile droplets and increases further with an increase in the number of participating droplets. The resulting self-propulsion of such small droplets reveals a new pathway for passive droplet removal and surface renewal during dropwise condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces, critical in multiple applications.</description>

Abstract: Viscoelastic fluids play a critical role in various engineering and biological applications, where their lubrication properties are strongly influenced by relaxation times ranging from microseconds to minutes. Although the lubrication mechanism for Newtonian fluids is well-established, its extension to viscoelastic materials - particularly under squeezing flow conditions - remains less explored. This study presents a semi-analytical solution for the lubrication force between two spheres approaching in a Boger fluid under small Deborah numbers. Unlike previous works that assumed a Newtonian velocity field, we derive the velocity profile directly from the mass-momentum conservation and Oldroyd-B constitutive equations using lubrication theory and order-of-magnitude analysis techniques. Under steady-state conditions, viscoelasticity induces a marginal increase in the surface-to-surface normal force as a result of the increased pressure required to overcome the original resistance from the first normal-stress difference. Transient analyses reveal that the normal lubrication force is bounded by two Newtonian plateaus and is nonsymmetric as the spheres approach or separate. Our findings highlight the role of viscoelasticity in improving load capacity and provide new insight for modelling dense particle suspensions in Boger fluids, where short-range interactions dominate.</description>
