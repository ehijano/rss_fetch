      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Gauge Field Dynamics in a Multilayer Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model hosts a quantum spin liquid in its ground state, where the excitations are gapless Majorana fermions and static $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge fluxes called visons. We consider Kitaev models stacked on top of each other, weakly coupled by Heisenberg interaction $\propto J_\perp$. This inter-layer coupling breaks the integrability of the model and makes the gauge fields dynamic. While single visons stay static in this model, an inter-layer pair of visons can hop with a hopping amplitude $\propto J_{\perp}$, but remains confined to a single plane. An intra-layer vison-pair, in contrast, is constrained to move along the stacking direction only. Depending on the anisotropy of the Kitaev couplings $K_x, K_y, K_z$, the intra-layer vison pairs show completely different dynamical behaviours. While coherent intra-layer tunnelling is possible for sufficiently strong anisotropies, only incoherent processes are possible in the isotropic case. When a magnetic field opens a gap for Majorana fermions, one can identify two types of intra-layer vison pairs, one bosonic and one fermionic. Only the bosonic pair obtains a hopping rate linear in $J_\perp$. We argue that our results can be used to identify leading instabilities of the Kitaev phase induced by the inter-layer coupling.</description>

      <title>Combined X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and $ab$ $initio$ study of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ under pressure: implications to the unified phase diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).</description>

      <title>Topological Dipole Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We expand the concept of two-dimensional topological insulators to encompass a novel category known as topological dipole insulators (TDIs), characterized by conserved dipole moments along the $x$-direction in addition to charge conservation. By generalizing Laughlin's flux insertion argument, we prove a no-go theorem and predict possible edge patterns and anomalies in a TDI with both charge $U^e(1)$ and dipole $U^d(1)$ symmetries. The edge of a TDI is characterized as a quadrupolar channel that displays a dipole $U^d(1)$ anomaly. A quantized amount of dipole gets transferred between the edges under the dipolar flux insertion, manifesting as `quantized quadrupolar Hall effect' in TDIs. A microscopic coupled-wire Hamiltonian realizing the TDI is constructed by introducing a mutually commuting pair-hopping terms between wires to gap out all the bulk modes while preserving the dipole moment. The effective action at the quadrupolar edge can be derived from the wire model, with the corresponding bulk dipolar Chern-Simons response theory delineating the topological electromagnetic response in TDIs. Finally, we enrich our exploration of topological dipole insulators to the spinful case and construct a dipolar version of the quantum spin Hall effect, whose boundary evidences a mixed anomaly between spin and dipole symmetry. Effective bulk and the edge action for the dipolar quantum spin Hall insulator are constructed as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos in the sparse SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a system of $N$ Majorana fermions with random interactions and strongly chaotic dynamics, which at low energy admits a holographically dual description as two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Hence the SYK model provides a toy model of quantum gravity that might be feasible to simulate with near-term quantum hardware. Motivated by the goal of reducing the resources needed for such a simulation, we study a sparsified version of the SYK model, in which interaction terms are deleted with probability $1{-p}$. Specifically, we compute numerically the spectral form factor (SFF, the Fourier transform of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalue pair correlation function) and the nearest-neighbor eigenvalue gap ratio $r$ (characterizing the distribution of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues). We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p&lt;p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.</description>

      <title>Hybridization induced triplet superconductivity with $S^z=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev superconducting chain is a model of spinless fermions with triplet-like superconductivity. It has raised interest since for some values of its parameters it presents a non-trivial topological phase that host Majorana fermions. The physical realization of a Kitaev chain is complicated by the scarcity of triplet superconductivity in real physical systems. Many proposals have been put forward to overcome this difficulty and fabricate artificial triplet superconducting chains. In this work we study a superconducting chain of spinful fermions forming Cooper pairs, in a triplet $S=1$ state, but with $S^z=0$. The motivation is that such pairing can be induced in chains that couple through an antisymmetric hybridization to an s-wave superconducting substrate. We study the nature of edge states and the topological properties of these chains. In the presence of a magnetic field the chain can sustain gapless superconductivity with pairs of Fermi points. The momentum space topology of these Fermi points is non-trivial, in the sense that they can only disappear by annihilating each other. For small magnetic fields, we find well defined degenerate edge modes with finite Zeemann energy. These modes are not symmetry protected and decay abruptly in the bulk as their energy merges with the continuum of excitations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Fermi Surface Nesting and the Nature of Heavy Quasiparticles in the Spin-Triplet Superconductor Candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electronic structure of a spin-triplet superconductor candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Notably, Fermi surface nesting hints at connections to magnetic excitation or quadrupole density wave phenomena, elucidating the superconducting mechanisms. Measured band structures reveal primarily localized 4f electrons, with minor itinerant contributions. Additionally, a transition from localized to itinerant behavior and significant c-f hybridization anisotropy underscore the role of f-electrons in shaping electronic properties. These findings deepen our understanding of CeRh$_2$As$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and magnetism. Further exploration promises advances in superconductivity research.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent conductivity, dielectric relaxation, electrical modulus and impedance spectroscopy of Ni substituted Na$_{3+2x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, dielectric relaxation, electric modulus and impedance behavior of Ni-doped NASICON ceramic Na$_{3+2x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.05--0.2) prepared using the solid-state reaction method. The increase in dielectric constant with temperature and decrease with frequency is explained on the basis of space charge polarization using the two-layer model of Maxwell-Wagner relaxation. The dielectric loss peak at lower temperatures follows the Arrhenius-type behavior with frequency having activation energy of 0.27$\pm$0.01~eV of dipolar relaxation, suggests similar type of defects are responsible for all the doped samples. The real ($\epsilon$ $^{'}$) and imaginary ($\epsilon$ $^{''}$) permittivity variation with frequency shows the broad relaxation behavior indicates the non-Debye type of relaxation in the measured temperature range. The permittivity values decrease with the amount of doping due to the increased number of charge carriers upon Ni doping at the Zr site. The grain contributions are observed at higher frequencies, while grain-boundary contributions occur at the lower side of frequencies. The imaginary part of the electric modulus also shows two types of relaxation peaks for all the samples indicating similar activation energy at low temperatures and variable activation energy at higher temperatures. The fitting of the imaginary modulus using KWW function shows the non-Debye type of relaxation. We find that all modulus curves merge with each other at low temperatures showing a similar type of relaxation, while curves at high temperatures show the dispersed behavior above the peak frequency. The {\it a.c.} conductivity data are fitted using the double power law confirming the grain and grain boundary contributions in total conductivity.</description>

Abstract: Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution. The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins.</description>

      <title>Subspace restricted thermalization in a correlated-hopping model with strong Hilbert space fragmentation characterized by irreducible strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions in which a particle can hop between two neighboring sites only if the sites to the left and right of those two sites have different particle numbers. Using a bond to site mapping, this model involving four-site terms can be mapped to an assisted pair-flipping model involving only three-site terms. This model shows strong Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). We define irreducible strings (IS) to label the different fragments, determine the number of fragments, and the sizes of fragments corresponding to some special IS. In some classes of fragments, the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized completely, and in others it can be seen to have a structure characteristic of models which are not fully integrable. In the largest fragment in our model, the number of states grows exponentially with the system size, but the ratio of this number to the total Hilbert space dimension tends to zero exponentially in the thermodynamic limit. Within this fragment, we provide numerical evidence that only a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) remains valid; we call this the subspace-restricted ETH. This is a modification of the usual ETH which combines the strong and weak versions of ETH and is also applicable to fragments of all dimensions. To understand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the model, we study the infinite-temperature time-dependent autocorrelation functions starting from a random initial state; we find that these exhibit a different behavior near the boundary compared to the bulk. We finally propose an experimental setup to realize our correlated-hopping model.</description>

      <title>Krylov localization as a probe for ergodicity breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the inverse localization length on the Krylov chain as a probe to detect weak ergodicity-breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different system sizes at the point of weak ergodicity-breaking leading to a quantitative prediction. We further show universal traits of different operators in the ergodic regime beyond the scrambling dynamics. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Cooling Algorithm for Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge. With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size, as long as the initial state is prepared in a low energy sector of polynomial size. We achieve the latter via a fast, quasi-adiabatic sweep from a parameter regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We generalize the algorithm to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Anomaly in open quantum systems and its implications on mixed-state quantum phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic way to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly in open quantum systems. Owing to nontrivial couplings to the environment, symmetries in such systems manifest as either strong or weak type. By representing their symmetry transformation through superoperators, we incorporate them in a unified framework and calculate their anomalies. In the case where the full symmetry group is $K\times G$, with $K$ the strong symmetry and $G$ the weak symmetry, we find that anomalies of bosonic systems are classified by $H^{d+2}(K\times G,U(1))/H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$ in $d$ spatial dimensions. To illustrate the power of anomalies in open quantum systems, we generally prove that anomaly must lead to nontrivial mixed-state quantum phases as long as the weak symmetry is imposed.
  Analogous to the ``anomaly matching" condition ensuring nontrivial low-energy physics in closed systems, anomaly also guarantees nontrivial long-time dynamics, specifically steady states of Lindbladians, in open quantum systems. Notably, we identify a new exotic phase in $(1+1)$-D where the steady state shows no nontrivial correlation function in the bulk, but displays spontaneous symmetry breaking order on the boundary, which is enforced by anomalies. We discuss the general relations between mixed-state anomalies and such unconventional boundary correlation. Finally, we explore the generalization of the ``anomaly inflow" mechanism in open quantum systems. We construct $(1+1)$-D and $(2+1)$-D Lindbladians whose steady states have mixed-state symmetry-protected-topological order in the bulk, with corresponding edge theories characterized by nontrivial anomalies.</description>

      <title>From Local to Emergent Altermagnetism: Footprints of Free Fermions Band Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramers non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting the free-fermion topology of linear, bi-quadratic and bi-cubic band touchings that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$ and $3$ spherical harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a nematic spin-triplet superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in real materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and showcase a novel spin-disordered alter-valleymagnet phase.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating the wormhole mechanism of the entanglement spectrum via a perturbed boundary</title>

Abstract: The Li-Haldane conjecture is one of the most famous conjectures in physics and opens a new research area in the quantum entanglement and topological phase. Although a lot of theoretical and numerical works have confirmed the conjecture in topological states with bulk-boundary correspondence, the cases with gapped boundary and the systems in high dimension are widely unknown. What is the valid scope of the Li-Haldane conjecture? Via the newly developed quantum Monte Carlo scheme, we are now able to extract the large-scale entanglement spectrum (ES) and study its relation with the edge energy spectrum generally. Taking the two-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model with a tunable boundary on the square-octagon lattice as an example, we find several counterexamples which cannot be explained by the Li-Haldane conjecture; e.g., the low-lying entanglement spectrum does not always show similar behaviors as the energy spectrum on the virtual boundary, and sometimes the ES resembles the energy spectrum of the edge even if it is gapped. Finally, we demonstrate that the newly proposed wormhole mechanism on the path integral of a reduced density matrix is the formation principle of the general ES. We find that the Li-Haldane conjecture is a particular case in some limit of the wormhole picture while all the examples of the conjecture we have studied can totally be explained within the wormhole mechanism framework. Our results provide important evidence for demonstrating that the wormhole mechanism is the fundamental principle to explain the ES.</description>

Abstract: Following a theoretical proposal on multi-impurity charge Kondo circuits [T. K. T. Nguyen and M. N. Kiselev, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 97}, 085403 (2018)] and the experimental breakthrough in fabrication of the two-site Kondo simulator [W. Pouse {\it et al}, Nat. Phys. (2023)] we investigate a thermoelectric transport through a double-dot charge Kondo quantum nano-device in the strong coupling operational regime. We focus on the fingerprints of the non-Fermi liquid and its manifestation in the charge and heat quantum transport. We construct a full-fledged quantitative theory describing crossovers between different regimes of the multi-channel charge Kondo quantum circuits and discuss possible experimental realizations of the theory.</description>

      <title>Exact hole-induced $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in certain $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the motion of a single hole induces $SU(N)$ flavor-singlets in the $U=\infty$ $SU(N)$ (Fermi) Hubbard model on a Husimi-like tree graph. The result is also generalized to certain $t$-$J$ models with antiferromagnetic interactions and singlet hopping terms typically neglected in the literature. This is an $SU(N)$ generalization of the "counter-Nagaoka theorem" introduced in [Phys. Rev. B 107, L140401 (2023)]. Our results suggest the existence of antiferromagnetic or resonating-valence-bond (RVB)-like polarons in the $t$-$J$ models on a more realistic non-bipartite lattice. Such antiferromagnetic/RVB polarons may be relevant for a novel strong-coupling mechanism of superconductivity or other exotic fractionalized phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Transverse and longitudinal magnons in strongly anisotropic antiferromagnet FePSe3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FePSe3 is a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with an easy-axis anisotropy and large spins S=2. It belongs to a family of magnetic van der Waals materials, which recently attracted a considerable attention. In this work we present an experimental magneto-optical study of the low-energy excitation spectrum in FePSe3, together with its theoretical description. The observed response contains several types of magnon excitations. Two of them are conventional transverse magnons described by a classical theory of antiferromagnetic resonance. Two other modes are identified as multimagnon hexadecapole excitations with an anomalous g factor approximately equal to four times the g factor of a single Fe^2+ ion. These quasiparticles correspond to full reversals of iron spins that coherently propagate in the up-down antiferromagnetic structure. They constitute a novel type of collective excitations in anisotropic magnetic solids, called longitudinal magnons. Comparison between theory and experiment allows us to estimate the microscopic parameters of FePSe3 including exchange coupling constants and the single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>

      <title>Signatures of metal to insulator crossover in the repulsive Fermi Hubbard model through static correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold atom systems provide a rich platform to realize strongly interacting condensed matter systems, and recent progress in fluorescence imaging technique has enabled identification of nontrivial doublon, singlon, and holon correlation functions. We show that these correlators can be used to identify the conditions under which local moments form in an interacting electronic system. Toward this end, we report a Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) study of such correlation functions in the two-dimensional repulsive Fermi Hubbard model on a square lattice as a function of doping, interaction strength and temperature. We find definite signatures of the crossover from small U(band regime) to large U(correlated insulator regime). Our key findings are: (1) An opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states is accompanied by the appearance of temperature insensitive points in the equation of state at finite doping, which can be used to distinguish the band regime in cold atom experiments. (2) Nearest neighbor doublon holon correlations track the opening of charge gap; these compete with density correlations to generate moment moment correlations that show different behavior in the metallic and correlated insulator regime. (3) Non local correlation functions can be used to distinguish between the two regimes, both at and away from half filling. Our results allow comparisons of different correlation functions with recent experimental findings and guide further experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Engineering 3D Floquet codes by rewinding</title>

Abstract: Floquet codes are a novel class of quantum error-correcting codes with dynamically generated logical qubits arising from a periodic schedule of non-commuting measurements. We utilize the interpretation of measurements in terms of condensation of topological excitations and the rewinding of measurement sequences to engineer new examples of Floquet codes. In particular, rewinding is advantageous for obtaining a desired set of instantaneous stabilizer groups on both toric and planar layouts. Our first example is a Floquet code with instantaneous stabilizer codes that have the same topological order as 3D toric code(s). This Floquet code also exhibits a splitting of the topological order of the 3D toric code under the associated sequence of measurements, i.e., an instantaneous stabilizer group of a single copy of 3D toric code in one round transforms into an instantaneous stabilizer group of two copies of 3D toric codes up to nonlocal stabilizers in the following round. We further construct boundaries for this 3D code and argue that stacking it with two copies of 3D subsystem toric code allows for a transversal implementation of the logical non-Clifford $CCZ$ gate. We also show that the coupled-layer construction of the X-cube Floquet code can be modified by a rewinding schedule such that each of the instantaneous stabilizer codes is finite-depth-equivalent to the X-cube model up to toric codes; the X-cube Floquet code exhibits a splitting of the X-cube model into a copy of the X-cube model and toric codes under the measurement sequence. Our final 3D example is a generalization of the 2D Floquet toric code on the honeycomb lattice to 3D, which has instantaneous stabilizer codes with the same topological order as the 3D fermionic toric code.</description>

      <title>Efficient Large-Scale Many-Body Quantum Dynamics via Local-Information Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During time evolution of many-body systems entanglement grows rapidly, limiting exact simulations to small-scale systems or small timescales. Quantum information tends however to flow towards larger scales without returning to local scales, such that its detailed large-scale structure does not directly affect local observables. This allows for the removal of large-scale quantum information in a way that preserves all local observables and gives access to large-scale and large-time quantum dynamics. To this end, we use the recently introduced information lattice to organize quantum information into different scales, allowing us to define local information and information currents which we employ to systematically discard long-range quantum correlations in a controlled way. Our approach relies on decomposing the system into subsystems up to a maximum scale and time evolving the subsystem density matrices by solving the subsystem von Neumann equations in parallel. Importantly, the information flow needs to be preserved during the discarding of large-scale information. To achieve this without the need to make assumptions about the microscopic details of the information current, we introduce a second scale at which information is discarded while using the state at the maximum scale to accurately obtain the information flow. The resulting algorithm, which we call local information time evolution (LITE), is highly versatile and suitable for investigating many-body quantum dynamics in both closed and open quantum systems with diverse hydrodynamic behaviors. We present results for energy transport in the mixed-field Ising model and magnetization transport in an open XX spin chain where we accurately determine the diffusion coefficients. The information lattice framework employed here promises to offer insightful results about the spatial and temporal behavior of entanglement in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fractonic Quantum Quench in Dipole-constrained Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quench dynamics in the dipolar Bose-Hubbard model (DBHM) in one dimension. The boson hopping is constrained by dipole conservation and show fractonic dynamics. The ground states at large Hubbard interaction $U$ are Mott insulators at integer filling and a period-2 charge density wave (CDW) at half-integer filling. We focus on Mott-to-Mott and CDW-to-CDW quenches and find that dipole correlation spreading shows the light-cone behavior with the Lieb-Robinson (LR) velocity proportional to the dipole kinetic energy $J$ and the square of the density in the case of Mott quench at integer filling. Effective model for post-quench dynamics is constructed under the dilute-dipole approximation and fits the numerical results well. For CDW quench we observe a much reduced LR velocity of order $J^2/U$ and additional periodic features in the time direction. The emergence of CDW ground state and the reduced LR velocity at half-integer filling can both be understood by careful application of the second-order perturbation theory. The oscillatory behavior arises from quantum scars in the quadrupole sector of the spectrum and is captured by a PXP-like model that we derive by projecting the DBHM to the quadrupolar sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Compensated Ferrimagnets with Colossal Spin Splitting in Organic Compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the magnetic order has recently been invigorated by the discovery of exotic collinear antiferromagnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Examples include altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnets, which show spin splittings of the electronic band structures even at zero net magnetization, leading to several unique transport phenomena, notably spin-current generation. Altermagnets demonstrate anisotropic spin splitting, such as $d$-wave, in momentum space, whereas compensated ferrimagnets exhibit isotropic spin splitting. However, methods to realize compensated ferrimagnets are limited. Here, we demonstrate a method to realize a fully compensated ferrimagnet with isotropic spin splitting utilizing the dimer structures inherent in organic compounds. Moreover, based on $ab$ $initio$ calculations, we find that this ferrimagnet can be realized in the recently discovered organic compound (EDO-TTF-I)$_2$ClO$_4$. Our findings provide an unprecedented strategy for using the dimer degrees of freedom in organic compounds to realize fully compensated ferrimagnets with colossal spin splitting.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>
