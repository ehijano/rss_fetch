      <title>Rogue Variable Theory: A Quantum-Compatible Cognition Framework with a Rosetta Stone Alignment Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the most consequential dynamics in human cognition occur \emph{before} events become explicit: before decisions are finalized, emotions are labeled, or meanings stabilize into narrative form. These pre-event states are characterized by ambiguity, contextual tension, and competing latent interpretations. Rogue Variable Theory (RVT) formalizes such states as \emph{Rogue Variables}: structured, pre-event cognitive configurations that influence outcomes while remaining unresolved or incompatible with a system's current representational manifold. We present a quantum-consistent information-theoretic implementation of RVT based on a time-indexed \emph{Mirrored Personal Graph} (MPG) embedded into a fixed graph Hilbert space, a normalized \emph{Quantum MPG State} (QMS) constructed from node and edge metrics under context, Hamiltonian dynamics derived from graph couplings, and an error-weighted `rogue operator'' whose principal eigenvectors identify rogue factor directions and candidate Rogue Variable segments. We further introduce a \emph{Rosetta Stone Layer} (RSL) that maps user-specific latent factor coordinates into a shared reference Hilbert space to enable cross-user comparison and aggregation without explicit node alignment. The framework is fully implementable on classical systems and does not assume physical quantum processes; \emph{collapse} is interpreted as informational decoherence under interaction, often human clarification.</description>

      <title>Model-Behavior Alignment under Flexible Evaluation: When the Best-Fitting Model Isn't the Right One</title>

Abstract: Linearly transforming stimulus representations of deep neural networks yields high-performing models of behavioral and neural responses to complex stimuli. But does the test accuracy of such predictions identify genuine representational alignment? We addressed this question through a large-scale model-recovery study. Twenty diverse vision models were linearly aligned to 4.5 million behavioral judgments from the THINGS odd-one-out dataset and calibrated to reproduce human response variability. For each model in turn, we sampled synthetic responses from its probabilistic predictions, fitted all candidate models to the synthetic data, and tested whether the data-generating model would re-emerge as the best predictor of the simulated data. Model recovery accuracy improved with training-set size but plateaued below 80%, even at millions of simulated trials. Regression analyses linked misidentification primarily to shifts in representational geometry induced by the linear transformation, as well as to the effective dimensionality of the transformed features. These findings demonstrate that, even with massive behavioral data, overly flexible alignment metrics may fail to guide us toward artificial representations that are genuinely more human-aligned. Model comparison experiments must be designed to balance the trade-off between predictive accuracy and identifiability-ensuring that the best-fitting model is also the right one.</description>

      <title>Deep Teleportation: Quantum Simulation of Conscious Report in Attentional Blink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent quantum models of cognition have successfully simulated several interesting effects in human experimental data, from vision to reasoning and recently even consciousness. The latter case, consciousness has been a quite challenging phenomenon to model, and most efforts have been through abstract mathematical quantum methods, mainly focused on conceptual issues. Classical (non-quantum) models of consciousness-related experiments exist, but they generally fail to align well with human data. We developed a straightforward quantum model to simulate conscious reporting of seeing or missing competing stimuli within the famous attentional blink paradigm. In an attentional blink task, a target stimulus (T2) that appears after a previous one (T1) can be consciously reported if the delay between presenting them is short enough (called lag 1), otherwise it can be rendered invisible during the so-called refractory period of attention (lags 2 to 6 and even longer). For modeling this phenomenon, we employed a three-qubit entanglement ansatz circuit in the form of a deep teleportation channel instead of the well-known EPR channel. While reporting the competing stimuli was supposed to be the classical measurement outcomes, the effect of distractor stimuli (i.e., masks, if any) was encoded simply as random angle rotations. The simulation outcome for different states was measured, and the classical outcome probabilities were further used as inputs to a simple linear neural network. The result revealed a non-linear, alternating state pattern that closely mirrors human responses in conscious stimuli reporting. The main result was a successful simulation of Lag 1 sparing, lag 7 divergence, and masking effect through probabilistic outcome of measurement in different conditions.</description>

      <title>Associations between iron and mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter nuclei in aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elevated kurtosis values have been observed in subcortical grey matter structures of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Here we tested whether these elevated values are related to iron content, which generate magnetic fields that add to the diffusion encoding gradients. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and iron measures (R2* and magnetic susceptibility), respectively, in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in a discovery cohort (110 older and 63 younger adults) and replication cohort (72 healthy older adults). Iron-rich grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis, R2*, and magnetic susceptibility and white matter regions had lower mean kurtosis in the older adult group. In both cohorts, mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* and magnetic susceptibility in iron-rich grey matter nuclei. No association was seen between signal-to-noise ratio and mean kurtosis in any grey matter region, indicating that the increase in mean kurtosis was not due to reduced signal-to-noise. Finally, a phantom experiment found higher mean kurtosis as iron concentrations increased. Our findings indicate that kurtosis is associated with iron-sensitive metrics in iron-rich grey matter structures, suggesting that kurtosis may be sensitive to iron deposits.</description>
