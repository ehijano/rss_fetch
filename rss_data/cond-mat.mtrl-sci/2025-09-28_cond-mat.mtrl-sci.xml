      <title>Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly, slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity. Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%) by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance, highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping. This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES, Raman, FTIR).</description>

      <title>Strain-tunability of the multipolar Berry curvature in altermagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect describes the generation of a transverse voltage by a longitudinal current even in the absence of an external magnetic field. While typically observed in ferromagnets, it has also been predicted to arise in altermagnets, materials characterized by rotational symmetries that enable broken time reversal symmetry despite compensated collinear magnetic ordering. These symmetries enforce band (anti)crossings that can generate significant contributions to the Berry curvature that drives the anomalous Hall effect. This Berry curvature is predicted to exhibit a characteristic multipolar order, resulting in a symmetry-enforced distribution at or near net compensation which is highly sensitive to perturbations that distort this balance. However, exploring the predicted multipolar Berry curvature of altermagnets and its reversible manipulation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate evidence for the multipolar nature of the altermagnetic Berry curvature in MnTe by tuning the anomalous Hall effect via uniaxial stress. Upon straining, the magnitude of the anomalous Hall conductivity changes and, at a critical strain of 0.14%, the sign is reversed. Symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that this tunability is a direct consequence of the altermagnetic multipolar Berry curvature. Our results provide insight into the role of crystal and magnetic symmetries in the realization of higher-order Berry curvature distributions and their unique tunability.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the chiral, semiconducting phase LaRhC$_{2}$: a handedness resolved study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in quantum materials is a topic of significant importance due to its profound effects on the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of these systems. However, it is non-trivial to decouple the behavior of two enantiomorphs within the same material -- perhaps explaining why the influence of chirality on electrical properties has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we examine the electrical conductivity, magnetoresistance, and thermal expansion coefficient of LaRhC$_{2}$ -- a compound with a chiral crystal structure (tetragonal symmetry, space groups $\textit{P}$4$_{1}$ or $\textit{P}$4$_{3}$). The identification of a suitable monochiral domain was achieved via electron backscatter diffraction, which simultaneously determines crystallographic orientation and handedness. Both enantiomorphs are confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on monochiral specimens. The analysis of electrical resistivity was made possible through the single-domain extraction of enantiopure specimens from a polycrystalline sample using focused ion beam techniques. We establish that LaRhC$_{2}$ is a semiconductor with band gaps of approximately 20 meV and 33 meV parallel and perpendicular to the fourfold screw axis of the crystal structure, respectively -- consistent with band structure calculations. A significant anisotropy is also observed in the thermal expansion, electrical resistivity as well as angular-dependent magnetoresistance parallel and perpendicular o [001] crystallographic directions.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity of oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed a superparamagnetic-type response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in size) Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase. Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties and giant dielectric permittivity (&gt; 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz - 10 kHz. In this work we observed that the static relative dielectric permittivity of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders overcomes 10^6 and related the colossal values with the superparaelectric states of the ultra-small cores of the nanoparticles.Thus, obtained results open the way for the creation of silicon-compatible multiferroics - oxygen-deficient Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles with the superparamagnetic and superparaelectric properties, indispensable ultra-high k nanomaterials for advanced FETs and electronic logic elements.</description>

      <title>Charge, heat, and spin transport phenomena in metallic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solid state materials, gradients of the electro-chemical potential, the temperature, or the spin-chemical potential drive the flow of charge, heat, and spin angular momentum, resulting in a net transport of energy. Beyond the primary transport processes - such as the flow of charge, heat, and spin angular momentum driven by gradients in their respective potentials - a wide range of coupled or cross-linked transport responses can occur, giving rise to a rich variety of transport phenomena. These transport phenomena are commonly categorized under (anomalous) thermoelectric, thermomagnetic, and galvanomagnetic effects, along with their spin-dependent counterparts. However, establishing a systematic classification and comparison among them remains a complex and nontrivial task. This paper attempts a didactic overview of the different transport phenomena, by categorizing and briefly discussing each of them based on charge, heat, and spin transport in conducting solids. The phenomena are structured in three categories: collinear, transverse, and so-called `planar' transport effects. The resulting overview attempts to categorize all effects in a consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Automated Machine Learning Pipeline for Training and Analysis Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion, while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0 meV/{\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries with sub-{\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.</description>

      <title>Direct Deoxygenation of Phenol over Fe-based Bimetallic Surfaces using On-the-fly Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accelerated nudged elastic band (NEB) study of phenol direct deoxygenation (DDO) on Fe-based bimetallic surfaces using a recently developed Gaussian process regression (GPR) calculator. Our test calculations demonstrate that the GPR calculator achieves up to 3x speedup compared to conventional density functional theory (DFT) calculations while maintaining high accuracy, with energy barrier errors below 0.015 eV. Using GPR-NEB, we systematically examine the DDO mechanism on pristine Fe(110) and surfaces modified with Co and Ni in both top and subsurface layers. Our results show that subsurface Co and Ni substitutions preserve favorable thermodynamics and kinetics for both C-O bond cleavage and C-H bond formation, comparable to those on the pristine Fe(110) surface. In contrast, top-layer substitutions generally increase the C-O bond cleavage barrier, render the step endothermic, and result in significantly higher reverse reaction rates, making DDO unfavorable on these surfaces. This work demonstrates both the effectiveness of GRR-accelerated transition state searches for complex surface reactions and provides insights into rational design of bimetallic catalysts for selective deoxygenation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Foundation Interatomic Potentials via Message-Passing Pruning and Graph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic foundation models (AFMs) have great promise as accurate interatomic potentials, and have enabled data-efficient molecular dynamics simulations with near quantum mechanical accuracy. However, AFMs remain markedly slower at inference and are far more memory-intensive than conventional interatomic potentials, due to the need to capture a wide range of chemical and structural motifs in pre-training datasets requiring deep, parameter-rich model architectures. These deficiencies currently limit the practical use of AFMs in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at extended temporal and spatial scales. To address this problem, we propose a general workflow for accelerating and scaling AFMs containing message-passing architectures. We find that removing low-contribution message-passing layers from AFM backbones serves as an effective pruning method, significantly reducing the parameter count while preserving the accuracy and data-efficiency of AFMs. Once pruned, these models become more accessible for large scale simulations via a graph-partitioned, GPU-distributed strategy, which we implement and demonstrate within the AFM fine-tuning platform MatterTune. We show that this approach supports million-atom simulations on both single and multiple GPUs, and enables task-specific large-scale simulations at nanosecond timescales with AFM-level accuracy.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Antiferromagnetic-to-Altermagnetic Phase Transition and Topology in $(\mathrm{CrO}_2)_1/(\mathrm{TaO}_2)_2$ Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological aspects in altermagnets have come into focus recently, and tuning the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state into an altermagnetic phase remains an active frontier. We realize both within a rutile superlattice here in this paper. With first principles calculation, we show that a uniaxial strain of only 0.5$\%$ along the c axis converts the $(\mathrm{CrO}_2)_1/(\mathrm{TaO}_2)_2$ rutile superlattice from a trivial antiferromagnet into an altermagnet with topology accompanied by a weak SOC. The strain opens a spin-dependent band splitting of $\sim 1.1 eV$ and, despite the weak SOC together with in-plane magnetic moment orientation, generates an intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of order $10^3 S/cm$, comparable magnitude to that in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals. Tiny SOC here with in-plane \(\text{N\'eel}\) orientation gaps out the Weyl nodal rings, giving rise to 16 Weyl points in the superlattice. Thus, we point out a simple route toward strain and field tunable, low-dissipation altermagnetic electronics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Structure: Invariant Crystal Property Prediction with Pseudo-Particle Ray Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-term atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Seamless: Unexpected Defective Merging in Single-Orientation Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-orientation stitching of graphene has emerged as the predominant method for growth of large-area, high-quality graphene films. Particularly noteworthy is graphene grown on single-crystalline Cu(111)/sapphire substrates, which exhibits exceptionally planar oriented stitching due to the atomically smooth substrate, facilitating the formation of continuous, high-quality graphene monolayer. These single-orientation stitches have conventionally been regarded as seamless with negligible defect concentrations. In this report, we present experimental observations regarding graphene grown on single-crystalline Cu(111)/sapphire substrates. Among the graphene flakes with single-orientation, our findings reveal two major merging behaviors: one producing the expected seamless stitching, and another unexpectedly generating structural defects that create nanoscale pathways permitting water permeation. Notably, we identify a unique merging structure--overlapped junction, in which the edge of one graphene flake overlaps and lies atop the edge of another flake, rather than forming a continuous atomic stitch. This discovery challenges the conventional anticipation of single-orientation stitched graphene films as seamless single crystalline film, while offers unique perspective for graphene applications in molecular sieving, selective filtration membranes, and protective coatings.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Equilibrium Vacancy Concentration in Multi-Principal Element Alloys from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), also known as high-entropy alloys, have garnered significant interest across many applications due to their exceptional properties. Equilibrium vacancy concentrations in MPEAs influence diffusion and microstructural stability in these alloys. However, computing vacancy concentrations from ab-initio methods is computationally challenging due to the vast compositional space of MPEAs and the complexity of the local environment around each vacancy. In this work, we present an efficient approach to connect electronic structure calculations to equilibrium vacancy concentrations in MPEAs through embedded cluster expansions (eCE) and rigorous statistical mechanics methods. Using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations informed by eCE, we assess the variation in vacancy formation with alloy composition and temperature. Our method is demonstrated on a nine-component MPEA comprised of elements in groups 4, 5, and 6 of the periodic table. Correlations between alloy chemistry, short-range order, and equilibrium vacancy concentrations in alloys containing up to 9 different elements are analyzed. The vacancy concentration of refractory alloys increases with the addition of group 4 elements or elements whose mixing is energetically unfavorable. The insights into vacancy behavior and the efficient computational framework presented in this study serve as a guide for the design of complex concentrated alloys with controlled vacancy concentrations.</description>

      <title>Challenges and opportunities in proximity-driven exciton-spin engineering in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: van der Waals heterostructures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and two-dimensional (2D) magnets offer a versatile platform to study the coexistence and transformation of different excitons. By focusing on TMD WSe$_2$ and 2D magnetic CrI$_3$, as a bilayer WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ and a trilayer CrI$_3$/WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$, we provide their description using a parameter-free, high-fidelity many-body perturbation theory. This ab initio approach allows us to elucidate the character of magnetic Frenkel excitons in CrI3 and how the nonmagnetic Wannier-Mott excitons in WSe2 are modified by the proximity of CrI3. We reveal novel proximity-induced interlayer excitons in these heterostructures. In contrast to the sensitivity of proximity-induced modifications of excitons in WSe$_2$, which depend on the interfacial details, the interlayer magnetic excitons are remarkably robust and are present across the different stacking configurations between WSe$_2$ and CrI$_3$, simplifying their experimental demonstration. These findings suggest unexplored opportunities for information transduction using magnetic excitons and integrating photonics, electronics, and spintronics in proximitized materials.</description>

      <title>Electric-field effect on spin diffusion length in solids: An \textit{ab initio} study beyond the drift-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we developed an \textit{ab initio} approach of spin diffusion length (l_{s}) in solids [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046705 (2025)], based on a linearized density-matrix master equation with quantum treatment of electron scattering processes. In this work, we extend the method to include the drift term due to an electric field along a periodic direction, implemented efficiently using a Wannier-representation-based covariant derivative. We employ this approach to investigate the electric-field effect on l_{s} of monolayer WSe_{2}, bulk GaAs, bulk GaN, and graphene-h-BN heterostructure. Our results show that l_{s} can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by a moderate downstream or upstream field respectively. Although the widely-used drift-diffusion model performs well for WSe_{2} and GaAs, it can introduce large errors of the electric-field-induced changes of l_{s} in both GaN and graphene-h-BN. Thus, to accurately capture the influence of electric fields on l_{s} in realistic materials, it is necessary to go beyond the drift-diffusion model and adopt a microscopic \textit{ab initio} methodology. Moreover, in graphene-h-BN, we find that the field-induced change of l_{s} is not only governed by the drift term in the master equation, but is also significantly affected by the electric-field modification of the equilibrium density matrix away from Fermi-Dirac distribution function.</description>

      <title>Carrier-phonon decoupling via annealing enhances thermoelectric performance of Bi2(Te,Se)3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric cooling based on the Peltier effect requires high-performance materials near room temperature. In this work, Bi2Te2.6Se0.4 synthesized by melting-hot pressing followed by 100 h annealing (MT-HP-AN) at 723 K exhibits markedly improved performance. Annealing introduces cation vacancies via Te(Se) volatilization, lowering carrier density and enhancing mobility, while simultaneously increasing phonon scattering. A peak ZT of 1.06 at 373 K and an average ZT of 0.99 at 300-423 K are achieved. This MT-HP-AN approach offers a simple yet effective strategy to decouple carrier and phonon transport, advancing the potential of n-type BTS for thermo-electric cooling applications.</description>

      <title>An empirical potential to simulate helium and hydrogen in highly irradiated tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials used in commercial D-T fusion reactors will be exposed to irradiation and a mixture of helium and hydrogen plasma. Modeling the microstructural evolution of such materials requires the use of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The focus of this study is to develop a fast EAM potential for the interactions among the three elements (W, H, and He), fitted to accurately reproduce both the ab initio formation energies and relaxation volumes of small defect clusters containing light gases within tungsten. The potential enables the study of tungsten under irradiation and in the presence of light gases. To demonstrate the utility of the potential, we construct a thermodynamically motivated model for predicting the energetics of light-gas-filled voids. The model is then validated through molecular dynamics simulations with our new potential.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Collision Cascades in Niobium: Comparing Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation damage in structural materials is a major challenge for advanced nuclear energy systems, and niobium is of particular interest due to its high melting point, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance. To better understand its radiation response, we carried out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of collision cascades in pure niobium at 300 K over a primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy range of 1-75 keV, employing four interatomic potentials: an embedded atom method (EAM), two Finnis-Sinclair models (FS-1 and FS-2), and a machine learning-based spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) we developed. All reproduce the general features of cascade formation but differ significantly in defect production, clustering, and morphology. At low energies, defect generation follows trends governed by threshold displacement energy (TDE) and the stiffness-to-range ratio (|S/R|). At higher energies, subcascade formation makes defect evolution dependent on the combined effects of |S/R|, average TDE, and other material-specific factors. Vacancy clustering dominates over interstitial clustering across all cases: EAM produces the largest vacancy clusters and the highest clustering fraction, while SNAP shows the strongest interstitial clustering. Morphological analysis indicates that EAM forms a balanced mix of 1/2&lt;111&gt;, 1/2&lt;110&gt; loops, C15 rings, and hybrid structures; FS-2 favors extended 1/2&lt;111&gt; dumbbells, crowdions, and dislocation loops; whereas FS-1 and SNAP generate more compact or disordered clusters, with SNAP produces a high fraction of C15-like rings (maximum size up to nine atoms) that may evolve into dislocation loops of 1/2&lt;111&gt; and &lt;100&gt;. These findings give clear insights into how niobium reacts when exposed to irradiation, especially at high energies.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present rich dynamics that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin polarization, in agreement with expectations in older works. Propagating walls are obtained for an in-plane polarization. We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, the main features of the wall profile are obtained by a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. We discuss the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of nitrogen nuclear spins via the V$_B^-$-center in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged boron vacancies (V$_\text{B}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for quantum nanoscale sensing and imaging. While these primarily involve electron spins, nuclear spins provide an additional resource for quantum operations. This work presents a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the properties and coherent control of the nearest-neighbor $^{15}$N nuclear spins of V$_\text{B}^-$-ensembles in isotope-enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Multi-nuclear spin states are selectively addressed, enabled by state-specific nuclear spin transitions arising from spin-state mixing. We perform Rabi driving between selected state pairs, define elementary quantum gates, and measure longer than 10~$\mu$s nuclear Rabi coherence times. We observe a two orders of magnitude nuclear g-factor enhancement that underpins fast nuclear spin gates. Accompanying numerical simulations provide a deep insight into the underlying mechanisms. These results establish the foundations for leveraging nuclear spins in V$_\text{B}^-$ center-based quantum applications, particularly for extending coherence times and enhancing the sensitivity of 2D quantum sensing foils.</description>

      <title>Self-organization mechanism in Bridgman-grown MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n: influence on layer sequence and magnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of high-quality magnetic topological insulator crystals by the Bridgman method remains challenging due to thermodynamic limitations inherent to this technique. Nevertheless, this approach continues to provide bulk materials with significantly reduced free carrier concentrations compared to epitaxial methods. Here, we investigate the Inverted Vertical Bridgman growth of MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n crystals, with particular emphasis on the structural ordering of MnBi2Te4 septuple layers within the Bi2Te3 quintuple-layer matrix and its influence on magnetic properties. Through a detailed analysis of growth dynamics, we identify four distinct stages, including a turbulent flow regime promoting pure MnBi2Te4 phase, rapid MnTe precipitation reducing Mn content in the melt, a stationary growth phase supporting ordered stacking of septuple and quintuple layers, and a final stage marked by flow cessation and defect formation. We demonstrate that septuple layer spacing is inversely correlated with MnTe supersaturation due to the diffusion-limited incorporation in stationary growth phase. Magnetic characterization reveals antiferromagnetic ordering in pure MnBi2Te4 phase and in MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n heterostructure, with ferromagnetism emerging for wider septuple layer spacing. We determine critical temperatures for observed antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phase transitions and magnetic anisotropy constants for ferromagnetic samples. Our findings highlight key growth parameters governing magnetic and structural quality, offering a pathway to scalable synthesis of layered topological insulators with tunable magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Linear-scaling calculation of experimental observables for molecular augmented dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning theoretical atomistic structural models of materials with available experimental data presents a significant challenge for disordered systems. The configurational space to navigate is vast, and faithful realizations require large system sizes with quantum-mechanical accuracy in order to capture the distribution of structural motifs present in experiment. Traditional equilibrium sampling approaches offer no guarantee of generating structures that coincide with experimental data for such systems. An efficient means to search for such structures is molecular augmented dynamics (MAD) [arXiv:2508.17132], a modified molecular dynamics method that can generate ab-initio accurate, low-energy structures through a multi-objective optimization of the interatomic potential energy and the experimental potential. The computational scaling of this method depends on both the scaling of the interatomic potential and that of the experimental potential. We present the general equations for MAD with linear-scaling formulations for calculating and matching X-ray/neutron diffraction and local observables, e.g., the core-electron binding energies used in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. MAD simulations can both find metastable structures compatible with non-equilibrium experimental synthesis and lower energy structures than alternative computational sampling protocols, like the melt-quench approach. In addition, generalizing the virial tensor with the experimental forces enables generalized barostatting, allowing one to find structures whose density matches that compatible with the experimental observables. Scaling tests with the TurboGAP code demonstrate their linear-scaling nature for both CPU and GPU implementations, the latter of which has a 100$\times$ speedup compared to the CPU.</description>

      <title>Directional strong coupling at the nanoscale between hyperbolic polaritons and organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling (SC) is a fundamental concept in physics that describes extreme interactions between light and matter. Recent experiments have demonstrated SC at the nanometer scale, where strongly confined polaritons, rather than photons, couple to quantum emitters or molecular vibrations. Coupling with the latter is generally referred to as vibrational SC (VSC) and is of significant fundamental and technological interest, as it can be an effective tool for modifying molecular properties. However, the implementation of VSC, especially at the nanoscale, depends on the development of tuning mechanisms that allow control over the coupling strength and, eventually, its directionality, opening the door for the selective coupling of specific molecular vibrations. Here we report the observation of directional VSC. Specifically, we show nanoscale images of propagating hyperbolic phonon polaritons (PhPs) coupled to pentacene molecules revealing that the fingerprint of VSC for propagating polaritons -- a marked anti-crossing in their dispersion at the vibrational resonance -- can be modulated as a function of the direction of propagation. In addition, we show that VSC can exhibit an optimal condition for thin molecular layers, characterized by a maximum coupling strength along one single direction. This phenomenon is understood by analysing the overlap of the polariton field with molecular layers of varying thicknesses. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings promise novel applications for directional sensing or local directional control of chemical properties at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic bits (p-bits) are stochastic hardware elements whose output probability can be tuned by an input bias, offering a route to energy-efficient architectures that exploit, rather than suppress, fluctuations. Here we report p-bit generation in an organic memristive device, establishing polymers as the first class of soft-matter systems to realize probabilistic hardware. The active element is a dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]pyrrole (DTP)-backbone polymer with pendant triphenylamine (TPA) groups, whose stochastic resistance fluctuations are converted into binary outputs by a simple voltage-divider/comparator circuit. The resulting probability distributions follow logistic transfer functions, characteristic of stochastic binary neurons. Separately, ensembles of pulsed IV measurements were analyzed to construct binned current distributions, from which the discrete Shannon entropy was calculated. Peaks in this entropy coincide with bias conditions that maximize variability in the memristor voltage drop, directly linking device-level stochasticity to intrinsic material properties. Dielectric analysis shows that pendant TPA units provide dynamically active relaxation modes, while energy-resolved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that the frontier orbitals of DTP, TPA and ITO align within the transport gap to produce a bifurcated percolation network. The correspondence between microscopic relaxation dynamics, electronic energetics and macroscopic probabilistic response highlights how organic semiconductors can serve as chemically tunable entropy sources, opening a polymer-based pathway toward thermodynamic computing.</description>

      <title>Interface and Thermophysical Properties of R32 Refrigerant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the urgent demand for efficient cooling in microelectronics and advanced thermal management systems, difluoromethane (R32/CH2F2) has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its favorable thermophysical properties, including high heat transfer efficiency and low viscosity. While bulk properties such as density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity have been widely studied, interfacial properties including surface tension and interfacial thickness remain comparatively underexplored, despite their importance in phase-transition dynamics. Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from 180 K-300 K using an optimized transferable force field for fluoropropenes with enhanced electrostatics to assess both bulk and interfacial behavior of R32. Simulations reproduced density within +/- 2.1%, viscosity within 3.05%, and thermal conductivity within 7.41% of NIST reference data. Heat capacities (Cp and Cv) were predicted within 5%. For interfacial properties, surface tension trends were reproduced within 15.8% deviation, and the vapor-liquid coexistence curve closely matched reference data, yielding a critical temperature of 345.7 K (1.6% deviation) and a critical density of 0.397 g/cm3 (6.4% deviation). Importantly, the vapor-liquid interface exhibited strong temperature dependence, with interfacial thickness increasing by 290% between 180 K and 290 K. These validated results provide predictive molecular-level insights, particularly for interfacial properties that remain less characterized. By reducing property prediction errors in key parameters such as critical temperature, this work provides reliable inputs for heat-exchanger and system models. Beyond R32, the methodology offers a transferable framework for blended and next-generation low-GWP refrigerants, contributing to sustainable thermal management aligned with the 2027 EU F-Gas regulation and 2030 Kigali Amendment.</description>

      <title>Real Space Imaging of Spin Scattering in Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between electron spin and molecular chirality plays a fundamental role in quantum phenomena, with significant implications for spintronics and quantum computing. The chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a particular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its underlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of spin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin scattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly due to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes typically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene electrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in both the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter scenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current amplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or current flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers into graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial spin distribution in chiral devices. This work establishes a new paradigm for investigating spin-dependent phenomena in chiral materials and opens avenues for developing chirality-based spintronic and quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of magnetoresistance effect in $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ antiferromagnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnets with the time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic structures possess a finite spin splitting in the momentum space, and may contribute to a realization of a finite tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect even with magnets with zero net spin polarization. In this paper, we study the TMR effect with the noncollinear antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ whose inverse $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic order breaks the time-reversal symmetry. In particular, we employ the representative barrier material $\mathrm{MgO}$ as the tunnel insulator, and calculate the TMR effect in the $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}(01\bar{1}0)/\mathrm{MgO}(110)/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which has an optimal geometry for the spin-orbit torque switching of the magnetic configurations. We show that a finite TMR ratio reaching $\gtrsim 1000\%$ appears in the $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ MTJs, which is due to the spin splitting properties of $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ in the momentum space combined with the screening effect of $\mathrm{MgO}$.</description>

      <title>Understanding the oxidation of pure Tungsten in air and its impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of pure W and the sublimation of W oxide have been investigated to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant. Pure W has been oxidised at temperatures between 400 and 1050C and for durations ranging between 1 and 70 h. The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling, which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale. The observed microstructure is discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.</description>

      <title>How to image single isolated atoms by using coherent low-energy electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent low-energy electrons have been demonstrated as a practical tool for imaging individual macromolecules and two-dimensional (2D) crystals. Low-energy electrons exhibit unique properties: low radiation damage to biological molecules and high sensitivity to the local potentials. In this study, we outline the conditions at which single isolated charge-free atoms can be imaged by low-energy electron holography. A single atom produces an interference pattern consisting of concentric fringes of finite diameter and of very weak intensity. The diffraction angle theta, determined as the first minimum of the concentric rings interference pattern, exhibits similar dependency on the source-to-sample distance zs as sin(theta) ~ 0.3/sqrt(zs) for electrons of different energies (50, 100 and 200 eV) and scattered off different elements (Li, C, and Cs). The results are compared to the recently reported experimental holograms of alkali atoms intercalated into bilayer graphene and adsorbed on top of graphene.</description>

      <title>Invar behavior and negative thermal expansion linked to magnetic transition in dhcp iron hydride under high pressure conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen incorporation into iron interstitial sites under high-pressure conditions forms iron hydride with a double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) structure. This phase is stable over a broad pressure-temperature range and exhibits a pressure-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. In this study, we revealed that dhcp iron hydride exhibits the Invar-like behaviour and its thermal expansion becomes negative at elevated pressures by X-ray diffraction. Our findings, supported by DFT+DMFT calculations, demonstrate that these anomalous volume changes are governed by magnetic transitions. Notably, the experimentally determined magnetic volume contribution is an order of magnitude smaller than previous theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an imaginary-time evolution method to evaluate the pure-state constrained-search functional from density-functional theory formulated on finite lattices. Simultaneously, it yields a potential that produces a prescribed density of an eigenstate. Besides being a computational scheme, this allows one to gain theoretical insights into the density-potential mapping. The method can be generalized to the optimization of the expectation value of a general self-adjoint operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a finite number of expectation-value constraints for commuting self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Tunable and Persistent Macroscopic Polarization in Nominally Centrosymmetric Defective Oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($&lt;$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic study of bound relations between different electronic properties of magnetic crystals: electron density, effective mass, orbital magnetization, localization length, Chern invariant, and electric susceptibility. All relations are satisfied for a group of low-lying bands, while some remain valid for upper bands. New results include a lower bound on the electric susceptibility of Chern insulators, and an upper bound on the sum-rule part of the orbital magnetization. In addition, bounds involving the Chern invariant are generalized from two dimensions (Chern number) to three (Chern vector). Bound relations are established for metals as well as insulators, and are illustrated for model systems. The manner in which they approach saturation in a model Chern insulator with tunable flat bands is analyzed in terms of the optical absorption spectrum.</description>

      <title>4D-QENS Analysis of Correlated Ionic Conduction in SrCl$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Methods of elucidating the mechanisms of fast-ion conduction in solid-state materials are pivotal for advancements in energy technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and supercapacitors. In this study, we examine the ionic conduction pathways in single crystal SrCl$_2$, which is a fast-ion conductor above 900~K, using four-dimensional Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (4D-QENS). We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However, the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism. This highlights the need for improvements both in the theory of ionic transport in fluorite compounds and the modeling of coherent 4D-QENS in single crystals.</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect of hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes in synthetic antiferromagnetic multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid chiral skyrmion tube is a well-known example of a 3D topological spin texture, exhibiting an intriguing chirality transition along the thickness direction. This transition progresses from left-handed to right-handed N\'eel-type chirality, passing through a Bloch-type intermediate state. Such an exotic spin configuration potentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common skyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have not been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of current-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube structure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the SyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree of magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling qualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic oscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The findings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of these complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>ReciNet: Reciprocal Space-Aware Long-Range Modeling for Crystalline Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting properties of crystals from their structures is a fundamental yet challenging task in materials science. Unlike molecules, crystal structures exhibit infinite periodic arrangements of atoms, requiring methods capable of capturing both local and global information effectively. However, current works fall short of capturing long-range interactions within periodic structures. To address this limitation, we leverage \emph{reciprocal space}, the natural domain for periodic crystals, and construct a Fourier series representation from fractional coordinates and reciprocal lattice vectors with learnable filters. Building on this principle, we introduce the reciprocal space-based geometry network (\textbf{ReciNet}), a novel architecture that integrates geometric GNNs and reciprocal blocks to model short-range and long-range interactions, respectively. Experimental results on standard benchmarks JARVIS, Materials Project, and MatBench demonstrate that ReciNet achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across a range of crystal property prediction tasks. Additionally, we explore a model extension to multi-property prediction with the mixture-of-experts, which demonstrates high computational efficiency and reveals positive transfer between correlated properties. These findings highlight the potential of our model as a scalable and accurate solution for crystal property prediction.</description>

Abstract: This article provides a comprehensive understanding of the interactions that can occur at the interface between liquids and materials. It describes the phenomena of sorption (adsorption and absorption), permeation and leaching from a physicochemical perspective. In addition to examining these interactions, the historical context, detailing how these phenomena have been studied and demonstrated over time, it provides an understanding of the evolution of research in this field and the methodologies used to study these interactions, with a specific focus on polymer materials. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are presented as well as the equations that describe the processes involved, thus providing a scientific basis for understanding the complexities of container-content interactions.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals, this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</description>

      <title>Developing a Complete AI-Accelerated Workflow for Superconductor Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20005</link>

Abstract: The quest to identify new superconducting materials with enhanced properties is hindered by the prohibitive cost of computing electron-phonon spectral functions, severely limiting the materials space that can be explored. Here, we introduce a Bootstrapped Ensemble of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (BEE-NET), a machine-learning model trained to predict the Eliashberg spectral function and superconducting critical temperature with a mean-absolute-error of 0.87 K relative to DFT-based Allen-Dynes calculations. Intriguingly, BEE-NET achieves a true-negative-rate of 99.4\%, enabling highly efficient screening for the rare property of superconductivity. Integrated into a multi-stage, AI-accelerated discovery pipeline that incorporates elemental-substitution strategies and machine-learned interatomic potentials, our workflow reduced over 1.3 million candidate structures to 741 dynamically and thermodynamically stable compounds with DFT-confirmed $T_{\mathrm{c}} &gt; 5$ K. We report the successful synthesis and experimental confirmation of superconductivity in two of these previously unreported compounds. This study establishes a data-driven framework that integrates machine learning, quantum calculations, and experiments to systematically accelerate superconductor discovery.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$ provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, $\texttt{FreeBird.jl}$ offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Non-Polymeric Crystal Structure Prediction: Why a Geometric, Permutation-Invariant Loss is Needed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction is an essential prerequisite for designing materials with targeted properties. Yet, it is still an open challenge in materials design and drug discovery. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately predicting three-dimensional non-polymeric crystal structures remains elusive. In this work, we focus on the molecular assembly problem, where a set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline structure. Such a simplified formulation provides a useful approximation to the actual problem. However, while recent state-of-the-art methods have increasingly adopted sophisticated techniques, the underlying learning objective remains ill-posed. We propose a better formulation that introduces a loss function capturing key geometric molecular properties while ensuring permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. Remarkably, we demonstrate that within this framework, a simple regression model already outperforms prior approaches, including flow matching techniques, on the COD-Cluster17 benchmark, a curated non-polymeric subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).</description>
