      <title>Modeling Joint Health Effects of Environmental Exposure Mixtures with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the association between mixtures of environmental exposures and health outcomes can be challenging due to issues such as correlation among the exposures and non-linearities or interactions in the exposure-response function. For this reason, one common strategy is to fit flexible nonparametric models to capture the true exposure-response surface. However, once such a model is fit, further decisions are required when it comes to summarizing the marginal and joint effects of the mixture on the outcome. In this work, we describe the use of soft Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to estimate the exposure-risk surface describing the effect of mixtures of chemical air pollutants and temperature on asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits during the warm season in Atlanta, Georgia from 2011-2018. BART is chosen for its ability to handle large datasets and for its flexibility to be incorporated as a single component of a larger model. We then summarize the results using a strategy known as accumulated local effects to extract meaningful insights into the mixture effects on asthma-related morbidity. Notably, we observe negative associations between nitrogen dioxide and asthma ED visits and harmful associations between ozone and asthma ED visits, both of which are particularly strong on lower temperature days.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Lower-Level English Club Soccer Using Crowd-Sourced Player Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we examine the capabilities of different mathematical models to accurately predict various levels of the English football pyramid. Existing work has largely focused on top-level play in European leagues; however, our work analyzes teams throughout the entire English Football League system. We modeled team performance using weighted Colley and Massey ranking methods which incorporate player valuations from the widely-used website Transfermarkt to predict game outcomes. Our initial analysis found that lower leagues are more difficult to forecast in general. Yet, after removing dominant outlier teams from the analysis, we found that top leagues were just as difficult to predict as lower leagues. We also extended our findings using data from multiple German and Scottish leagues. Finally, we discuss reasons to doubt attributing Transfermarkt's predictive value to wisdom of the crowd.</description>

      <title>Monitoring time to event in registry data using CUSUMs based on excess hazard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An aspect of interest in surveillance of diseases is whether the survival time distribution changes over time. By following data in health registries over time, this can be monitored, either in real time or retrospectively. With relevant risk factors registered, these can be taken into account in the monitoring as well. A challenge in monitoring survival times based on registry data is that data on cause of death might either be missing or uncertain. To quantify the burden of disease in such cases, excess hazard methods can be used, where the total hazard is modelled as the population hazard plus the excess hazard due to the disease.
  We propose a CUSUM procedure for monitoring for changes in the survival time distribution in cases where use of excess hazard models is relevant. The procedure is based on a survival log-likelihood ratio and extends previously suggested methods for monitoring of time to event to the excess hazard setting. The procedure takes into account changes in the population risk over time, as well as changes in the excess hazard which is explained by observed covariates. Properties, challenges and an application to cancer registry data will be presented.</description>

      <title>Temporal Patterns of Multiple Long-Term Conditions in Welsh Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities: An Unsupervised Clustering Approach to Disease Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and understanding the co-occurrence of multiple long-term conditions (MLTC) in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) is vital for effective healthcare management. These individuals often face earlier onset and higher prevalence of MLTCs, yet specific co-occurrence patterns remain unexplored. This study applies an unsupervised approach to characterise MLTC clusters based on shared disease trajectories using electronic health records (EHRs) from 13069 individuals with ID in Wales (2000-2021). The population consisted of 52.3% males and 47.7% females, with an average of 4.5 conditions per patient. Disease associations and temporal directionality were assessed, followed by spectral clustering to group shared trajectories. Males under 45 formed a single cluster dominated by neurological conditions (32.4%), while males above 45 had three clusters, the largest featuring circulatory conditions (51.8%). Females under 45 formed one cluster with digestive conditions (24.6%) as most prevalent, while those aged 45 and older showed two clusters: one dominated by circulatory conditions (34.1%), and the other by digestive (25.9%) and musculoskeletal (21.9%) issues. Mental illness, epilepsy, and reflux were common across groups. Individuals above 45 had higher rates of circulatory and musculoskeletal issues. These clusters offer insights into disease progression in individuals with ID, informing targeted interventions and personalised healthcare strategies.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of uRLLC in scalable Cell-free RAN System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an essential part of mobile communication systems that beyond the fifth generation (B5G) and sixth generation (6G), ultra reliable low latency communication (uRLLC) places strict requirements on latency and reliability. In recent years, with the improvement of mobile communication network performance, centralized and distributed processing of cell-free mMIMO has been widely studied, and wireless access networks (RAN) have also become a widely studied topic in academia. This paper analyzes the performance of a novel scalable cell-free RAN (CF-RAN) architecture with multiple edge distributed units (EDUs) in the scenario of finite block length. The upper and lower bounds on its spectral efficiency (SE) performance are derived, and the complete set's formula and distributed processing can be used as their two exceptional cases, respectively. Secondly, the paper further considers the distribution of users and large-scale fading models and studies the position distribution of remote radio units (RRUs). It is found that a uniform distribution of RRUs is beneficial for improving the SE of finite block length under specific error rate performance, and RRUs need to be interwoven as much as possible under multiple EDUs. This is different from traditional multi-node clustering centralized collaborative processing. The paper compares the performance of Monte Carlo simulation and multi-RRU clustering group collaborative processing. At the same time, this article verifies the accuracy of the space-time exchange theory in the CF-RAN scenario. Through scalable EDU deployment, a trade-off between latency and reliability can be achieved in practical systems and exchanged with spatial degrees of freedom. This implementation can be seen as a distributed and scalable implementation of the space-time exchange theory.</description>

      <title>Propensity Score Matching: Should We Use It in Designing Observational Studies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propensity Score Matching (PSM) stands as a widely embraced method in comparative effectiveness research. PSM crafts matched datasets, mimicking some attributes of randomized designs, from observational data. In a valid PSM design where all baseline confounders are measured and matched, the confounders would be balanced, allowing the treatment status to be considered as if it were randomly assigned. Nevertheless, recent research has unveiled a different facet of PSM, termed "the PSM paradox." As PSM approaches exact matching by progressively pruning matched sets in order of decreasing propensity score distance, it can paradoxically lead to greater covariate imbalance, heightened model dependence, and increased bias, contrary to its intended purpose. Methods: We used analytic formula, simulation, and literature to demonstrate that this paradox stems from the misuse of metrics for assessing chance imbalance and bias. Results: Firstly, matched pairs typically exhibit different covariate values despite having identical propensity scores. However, this disparity represents a "chance" difference and will average to zero over a large number of matched pairs. Common distance metrics cannot capture this ``chance" nature in covariate imbalance, instead reflecting increasing variability in chance imbalance as units are pruned and the sample size diminishes. Secondly, the largest estimate among numerous fitted models, because of uncertainty among researchers over the correct model, was used to determine statistical bias. This cherry-picking procedure ignores the most significant benefit of matching design-reducing model dependence based on its robustness against model misspecification bias. Conclusions: We conclude that the PSM paradox is not a legitimate concern and should not stop researchers from using PSM designs.</description>

      <title>Personalised dynamic super learning: an application in predicting hemodiafiltration convection volumes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining continuously updated predictions is a major challenge for personalised medicine. Leveraging combinations of parametric regressions and machine learning approaches, the personalised online super learner (POSL) can achieve such dynamic and personalised predictions. We adapt POSL to predict a repeated continuous outcome dynamically and propose a new way to validate such personalised or dynamic prediction models. We illustrate its performance by predicting the convection volume of patients undergoing hemodiafiltration. POSL outperformed its candidate learners with respect to median absolute error, calibration-in-the-large, discrimination, and net benefit. We finally discuss the choices and challenges underlying the use of POSL.</description>

      <title>Robust Genomic Prediction and Heritability Estimation using Density Power Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript delves into the intersection of genomics and phenotypic prediction, focusing on the statistical innovation required to navigate the complexities introduced by noisy covariates and confounders. The primary emphasis is on the development of advanced robust statistical models tailored for genomic prediction from single nucleotide polymorphism data in plant and animal breeding and multi-field trials. The manuscript highlights the significance of incorporating all estimated effects of marker loci into the statistical framework and aiming to reduce the high dimensionality of data while preserving critical information. This paper introduces a new robust statistical framework for genomic prediction, employing one-stage and two-stage linear mixed model analyses along with utilizing the popular robust minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) to estimate genetic effects on phenotypic traits. The study illustrates the superior performance of the proposed MDPDE-based genomic prediction and associated heritability estimation procedures over existing competitors through extensive empirical experiments on artificial datasets and application to a real-life maize breeding dataset. The results showcase the robustness and accuracy of the proposed MDPDE-based approaches, especially in the presence of data contamination, emphasizing their potential applications in improving breeding programs and advancing genomic prediction of phenotyping traits.</description>

      <title>Efficient modeling of sub-kilometer surface wind with Gaussian processes and neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately representing surface weather at the sub-kilometer scale is crucial for optimal decision-making in a wide range of applications. This motivates the use of statistical techniques to provide accurate and calibrated probabilistic predictions at a lower cost compared to numerical simulations. Wind represents a particularly challenging variable to model due to its high spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a novel approach that integrates Gaussian processes and neural networks to model surface wind gusts at sub-kilometer resolution, leveraging multiple data sources, including numerical weather prediction models, topographical descriptors, and in-situ measurements. Results demonstrate the added value of modeling the multivariate covariance structure of the variable of interest, as opposed to only applying a univariate probabilistic regression approach. Modeling the covariance enables the optimal integration of observed measurements from ground stations, which is shown to reduce the continuous ranked probability score compared to the baseline. Moreover, it allows the generation of realistic fields that are also marginally calibrated, aided by scalable techniques such as random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning. We discuss the effect of different modeling choices, as well as different degrees of approximation, and present our results for a case study.</description>
