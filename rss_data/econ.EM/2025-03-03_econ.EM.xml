      <title>Structural breaks detection and variable selection in dynamic linear regression via the Iterative Fused LASSO in high dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to develop a time series modeling methodology tailored to high-dimensional environments, addressing two critical challenges: variable selection from a large pool of candidates, and the detection of structural break points, where the model's parameters shift. This effort centers on formulating a least squares estimation problem with regularization constraints, drawing on techniques such as Fused LASSO and AdaLASSO, which are well-established in machine learning. Our primary achievement is the creation of an efficient algorithm capable of handling high-dimensional cases within practical time limits. By addressing these pivotal challenges, our methodology holds the potential for widespread adoption. To validate its effectiveness, we detail the iterative algorithm and benchmark its performance against the widely recognized Path Algorithm for Generalized Lasso. Comprehensive simulations and performance analyses highlight the algorithm's strengths. Additionally, we demonstrate the methodology's applicability and robustness through simulated case studies and a real-world example involving a stock portfolio dataset. These examples underscore the methodology's practical utility and potential impact across diverse high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Location Characteristics of Conditional Selective Confidence Intervals via Polyhedral Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the location characteristics of a conditional selective confidence interval based on the polyhedral method. This interval is constructed from the distribution of a test statistic conditional upon the event of statistical significance. In the case of a one-sided test, the behavior of the interval varies depending on whether the parameter is highly significant or only marginally significant. When the parameter is highly significant, the interval is similar to the usual confidence interval derived without considering selection. However, when the parameter is only marginally significant, the interval falls into an extreme range and deviates greatly from the estimated value of the parameter. In contrast, an interval conditional on two-sided significance does not yield extreme results, although it may exclude the estimated parameter value.</description>

      <title>Semidiscrete optimal transport with unknown costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semidiscrete optimal transport is a challenging generalization of the classical transportation problem in linear programming. The goal is to design a joint distribution for two random variables (one continuous, one discrete) with fixed marginals, in a way that minimizes expected cost. We formulate a novel variant of this problem in which the cost functions are unknown, but can be learned through noisy observations; however, only one function can be sampled at a time. We develop a semi-myopic algorithm that couples online learning with stochastic approximation, and prove that it achieves optimal convergence rates, despite the non-smoothness of the stochastic gradient and the lack of strong concavity in the objective function.</description>

      <title>Identification by non-Gaussianity in structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear structural vector autoregressive models can be identified statistically without imposing restrictions on the model if the shocks are mutually independent and at most one of them is Gaussian. We show that this result extends to structural threshold and smooth transition vector autoregressive models incorporating a time-varying impact matrix defined as a weighted sum of the impact matrices of the regimes. We also discuss the problem of labelling the shocks, estimation of the parameters, and stationarity the model. The introduced methods are implemented to the accompanying R package sstvars. Our empirical application studies the effects of the climate policy uncertainty shock on the U.S. macroeconomy. In a structural logistic smooth transition vector autoregressive model consisting of two regimes, we find that a positive climate policy uncertainty shock decreases production and increases inflation in times of both low and high economic policy uncertainty, but its inflationary effects are stronger in the periods of high economic policy uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Fisher Market Equilibrium and First-Price Pacing Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02303v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear Fisher market (LFM) is a basic equilibrium model from economics, which also has applications in fair and efficient resource allocation. First-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) is a model capturing budget-management mechanisms in first-price auctions. In certain practical settings such as advertising auctions, there is an interest in performing statistical inference over these models. A popular methodology for general statistical inference is the bootstrap procedure. Yet, for LFM and FPPE there is no existing theory for the valid application of bootstrap procedures. In this paper, we introduce and devise several statistically valid bootstrap inference procedures for LFM and FPPE. The most challenging part is to bootstrap general FPPE, which reduces to bootstrapping constrained M-estimators, a largely unexplored problem. We devise a bootstrap procedure for FPPE under mild degeneracy conditions by using the powerful tool of epi-convergence theory. Experiments with synthetic and semi-real data verify our theory.</description>
