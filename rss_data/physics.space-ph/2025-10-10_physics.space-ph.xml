      <title>Characterization of the Trans-Alfv\'enic Region Using Observations from Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to Earth the solar wind is usually super-Alfv\'enic, i.e. the speed of the solar wind is much larger than the Alfv\'en speed. However, in the lower coronal regions, the solar wind is mostly sub-Alfv\'enic. With the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) crossing the boundary between the sub- and super-Alfv\'enic flow, Bandyopadhyay et al. (2022) performed a turbulence characterization of the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind with initial data from encounters 8 and 9. In this study, we re-examine the turbulence properties such as turbulence amplitude, anisotropy of the magnetic field variance, intermittency and switchback strength extending with PSP data for encounters 8-19. The later orbits probe lower altitudes and experience sub-Alfv\'enic conditions more frequently providing a greater statistical coverage to contrast sub- and super-Alfv\'enic solar wind. Also, by isolating the intervals where the solar wind speed is approximately equal to the Alfv\'en speed, we explore the transition in more detail. We show that the amplitude of the normalized magnetic field fluctuation is smaller for the sub-Alfv\'enic samples. While solar wind turbulence in general is shown to be anisotropic, the sub-Alfv\'enic samples are more anisotropic than the super-Alfv\'enic samples, in general. Further, we show that the sub- and super-Alfv\'enic samples do not show much distinction in terms of intermittency strength. Finally, consistent with prior results, we find no evidence for polarity reversing &gt; 90 degrees switchbacks in the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind</description>

      <title>Does Turbulence at the Correlation Scale Regulate the Statistics of Magnetic Reconnection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of dynamical quantities associated with magnetic reconnection events embedded in a sea of strong background magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence using direct numerical simulations. We focus on the relationship of the reconnection properties to the statistics of global turbulent fields. For the first time, we show that the distribution in turbulence of reconnection rates (determined by upstream fields) is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the global turbulent magnetic field at the correlation scale. The average reconnection rates, and associated dissipation rates, during turbulence are thus much larger than predicted by using turbulent magnetic field fluctuation amplitudes at the dissipation or kinetic scales. Magnetic reconnection may therefore be playing a major role in energy dissipation in astrophysical and heliospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>Ion Stochastic Heating by Low-frequency Alfv\'en Wave Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-amplitude low-frequency Alfv\'en waves are commonly found in plasma environments, such as space plasmas, and play a crucial role in ion heating. The nonlinear interaction between oblique Alfv\'en wave spectra and ions has been studied. As the number of wave modes increases, ions are more likely to exhibit chaotic motion and experience stochastic heating. The stochastic heating threshold in the parameter space can be characterized by a single parameter, the effective relative curvature radius $P_{{eff.}}$. The results show excellent agreement with the chaotic regions identified through test particle simulations. The anisotropic characteristics of stochastic heating are explained using a uniform solid angle distribution model. The stochastic heating rate $Q=\dot{T}$ is calculated, and its relationship with wave conditions is expressed as $Q/(\Omega_i m_i v_A^2) = H(\alpha) \tilde{v}^3 \tilde{B}_w^2 \tilde{\omega}_1$, where $\alpha$ is propagating angle, $\Omega_i$ is the gyrofrequency, $m_i$ is the ion mass, $v_A$ is the Alfv\'en speed, $\tilde{v}$ is the dimensionless speed, $\tilde{B}_w$ is the dimensionless wave amplitude, and $\tilde{\omega}_1$ is the lowest dimensionless wave frequency.</description>
