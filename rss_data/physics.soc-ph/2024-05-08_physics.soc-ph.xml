      <title>Mass media competition and alternative ordering in social dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective behavior of a system of social agents subject to the competition between two mass media influences considered as external fields. We study under what conditions either of two mass media with different intensities can impose its message to the majority. In addition to a collective state dominated by the stronger mass media and a disordered phase, we characterize two nontrivial effects as the parameters of the system are varied: (i) the appearance of a majority sharing the state of the weaker mass media, and (ii) the emergence of an alternative ordering in a state different from those of either media. We explore the dependence of both phenomena on the topology of the network of interactions. We show that the presence of long-range interactions rather than random connections is essential for the occurrence of both effects. The model can be extended to include multiple mass media and we illustrate it by considering three mass media fields acting on the system. Nontrivial collective behaviors persist for some ranges of parameters: the weakest mass media can convince the majority, and the system can spontaneously order against all applied fields.</description>

      <title>Urban Boundary Delineation from Commuting Data with Bayesian Stochastic Blockmodeling: Scale, Contiguity, and Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common method for delineating urban and suburban boundaries is to identify clusters of spatial units that are highly interconnected in a network of commuting flows, each cluster signaling a cohesive economic submarket. It is critical that the clustering methods employed for this task are principled and free of unnecessary tunable parameters to avoid unwanted inductive biases while remaining scalable for high resolution mobility networks. Here we systematically assess the benefits and limitations of a wide array of Stochastic Block Models (SBMs)$\unicode{x2014}$a family of principled, nonparametric models for identifying clusters in networks$\unicode{x2014}$for delineating urban spatial boundaries with commuting data. We find that the data compression capability and relative performance of different SBM variants heavily depends on the spatial extent of the commuting network, its aggregation scale, and the method used for weighting network edges. We also construct a new measure to assess the degree to which community detection algorithms find spatially contiguous partitions, finding that traditional SBMs may produce substantial spatial discontiguities that make them challenging to use in general for urban boundary delineation. We propose a fast nonparametric regionalization algorithm that can alleviate this issue, achieving data compression close to that of unconstrained SBM models while ensuring spatial contiguity, benefiting from a deterministic optimization procedure, and being generalizable to a wide range of community detection objective functions.</description>

      <title>Universality of opinions disappearing in sociophysical models of opinion dynamics: From initial multitude of opinions to ultimate consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Possibility of reaching a consensus in social systems with strong initial fragmentation is one of the most interesting issues in sociopysics. It is also intriguing what the dynamics of such processes is. To address those problems, we performed computer simulations using well-established models of social opinion formation, namely the voter, Sznajd, and Latan\'e models. We investigated opinion dynamics in cases where the initial number of opinions is very large, equal to the number of actors (the voter and Latan\'e models) or when every second actor has their own opinion (Sznajd model), with some variations on the update schemes, lattice topologies, effective ranges of interaction, and information noise levels. For all considered models, the number of opinions assumed by the actors is finally almost always reduced to only one. However, while the voter and Latan\'e models exhibit a power-law time decrease in the number of opinions, the Sznajd model follows a complex three-stage behavior. We also demonstrated that the mean/median time of reaching the consensus scales with system size according to a power law for voter and Sznajd models, while for the Latan\'e model this increase is even faster. Our results show that in the studied models the consensus is possible, provided that a long enough and model-dependent time to reach this state is available.</description>

      <title>Network mutual information measures for graph similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of tasks in exploratory network analysis and machine learning, such as clustering network populations or identifying anomalies in temporal graph streams, require a measure of the similarity between two graphs. To provide a meaningful data summary for downstream scientific analyses, the graph similarity measures used in these unsupervised settings must be principled, interpretable, and capable of distinguishing meaningful overlapping network structure from statistical noise at different scales of interest. Here we derive a family of graph mutual information measures that satisfy these criteria and are constructed using only fundamental information theoretic principles. Our measures capture the information shared among networks according to different encodings of their structural information, with our mesoscale mutual information measure allowing for network comparison under any specified network coarse-graining. We test our measures in a range of applications on real and synthetic network data, finding that they effectively highlight intuitive aspects of network similarity across scales in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Community detection in multi-layer bipartite networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of community detection in multi-layer undirected networks has received considerable attention in recent years. However, practical scenarios often involve multi-layer bipartite networks, where each layer consists of two distinct types of nodes. Existing community detection algorithms tailored for multi-layer undirected networks are not directly applicable to multi-layer bipartite networks. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel multi-layer degree-corrected stochastic co-block model specifically designed to capture the underlying community structure within multi-layer bipartite networks. Within this framework, we propose an efficient debiased spectral co-clustering algorithm for detecting nodes' communities. We establish the consistent estimation property of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that an increased number of layers in bipartite networks improves the accuracy of community detection. Through extensive numerical experiments, we showcase the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by applying it to real-world multi-layer network datasets, yielding meaningful and insightful results.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Autocorrelation of Data on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks where each node has one or more associated numerical values are common in applications. This work studies how summary statistics used for the analysis of spatial data can be applied to non-spatial networks for the purposes of exploratory data analysis. We focus primarily on Moran-type statistics and discuss measures of global autocorrelation, local autocorrelation and global correlation. We introduce null models based on fixing edges and permuting the data or fixing the data and permuting the edges. We demonstrate the use of these statistics on real and synthetic node-valued networks.</description>

      <title>Effects of concurrency on epidemic spreading in Markovian temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.00754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concurrency of edges, quantified by the number of edges that share a common node at a given time point, may be an important determinant of epidemic processes in temporal networks. We propose theoretically tractable Markovian temporal network models in which each edge flips between the active and inactive states in continuous time. The different models have different amounts of concurrency while we can tune the models to share the same statistics of edge activation and deactivation (and hence the fraction of time for which each edge is active) and the structure of the aggregate (i.e., static) network. We analytically calculate the amount of concurrency of edges sharing a node for each model. We then numerically study effects of concurrency on epidemic spreading in the stochastic susceptible-infectious-susceptible and susceptible-infectious-recovered dynamics on the proposed temporal network models. We find that the concurrency enhances epidemic spreading near the epidemic threshold while this effect is small in many cases. Furthermore, when the infection rate is substantially larger than the epidemic threshold, the concurrency suppresses epidemic spreading in a majority of cases. In sum, our numerical simulations suggest that the impact of concurrency on enhancing epidemic spreading within our model is consistently present near the epidemic threshold but modest. The proposed temporal network models are expected to be useful for investigating effects of concurrency on various collective dynamics on networks including both infectious and other dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ranking Edges by their Impact on the Spectral Complexity of Information Diffusion over Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the numerous ways now available to quantify which parts or subsystems of a network are most important, there remains a lack of centrality measures that are related to the complexity of information flows and are derived directly from entropy measures. Here, we introduce a ranking of edges based on how each edge's removal would change a system's von Neumann entropy (VNE), which is a spectral-entropy measure that has been adapted from quantum information theory to quantify the complexity of information dynamics over networks. We show that a direct calculation of such rankings is computationally inefficient (or unfeasible) for large networks: e.g.\ the scaling is $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ per edge for networks with $N$ nodes. To overcome this limitation, we employ spectral perturbation theory to estimate VNE perturbations and derive an approximate edge-ranking algorithm that is accurate and fast to compute, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N)$ per edge. Focusing on a form of VNE that is associated with a transport operator $e^{-\beta{ L}}$, where ${ L}$ is a graph Laplacian matrix and $\beta&gt;0$ is a diffusion timescale parameter, we apply this approach to diverse applications including a network encoding polarized voting patterns of the 117th U.S. Senate, a multimodal transportation system including roads and metro lines in London, and a multiplex brain network encoding correlated human brain activity. Our experiments highlight situations where the edges that are considered to be most important for information diffusion complexity can dramatically change as one considers short, intermediate and long timescales $\beta$ for diffusion.</description>

      <title>Affective Polarization and Dynamics of Information Spread in Online Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Members of different political groups not only disagree about issues but also dislike and distrust each other. While social media can amplify this emotional divide -- called affective polarization by political scientists -- there is a lack of agreement on its strength and prevalence. We measure affective polarization on social media by quantifying the emotions and toxicity of reply interactions. We demonstrate that, as predicted by affective polarization, interactions between users with same ideology (in-group replies) tend to be positive, while interactions between opposite-ideology users (out-group replies) are characterized by negativity and toxicity. Second, we show that affective polarization generalizes beyond the in-group/out-group dichotomy and can be considered a structural property of social networks. Specifically, we show that emotions vary with network distance between users, with closer interactions eliciting positive emotions and more distant interactions leading to anger, disgust, and toxicity. Finally, we show that similar information exhibits different dynamics when spreading in emotionally polarized groups. These findings are consistent across diverse datasets spanning discussions on topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic and abortion in the US. Our research provides insights into the complex social dynamics of affective polarization in the digital age and its implications for political discourse.</description>
