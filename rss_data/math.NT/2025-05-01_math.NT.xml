      <title>Hilbert's Theorem 90, periodicity, and roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E/F$ be a cyclic field extension of degree $n$, and let $\sigma$ generate the group Gal$(E/F)$. If Tr${}^E_F(y)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sigma^i y=0$, then the additive form of Hilbert's Theorem 90 asserts that $y=\sigma x-x$ for some $x\in E$. Suppose that $E$ has characteristic $p$. We prove that $x$ gives rise to a periodic sequence $x_0,x_1,\dots$ which has period $pn_p$, where $n_p$ is the largest $p$-power that divides $n$. As an application, we find closed-form expressions for the roots of Artin-Schreier polynomials $t^p-t-y$. Let $y$ lie in the finite field $F_{p^n}$ of order $p^n$. The Artin-Schreier polynomial $t^p-t-y\in F_{p^n}[t]$ is reducible precisely when $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}y^{p^i}=0$. In this case, $t^p-t-y=\prod_{k=0}^{p-1}(t-x-k)$ where $x=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}y^{p^i}$ for some $z\in F_{p^e}$ and $e=n_p$. The sequence $\left(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1}z^{p^j}\right)_{i\ge0}$ is periodic with period $pe$, and if $e$ is small, then we give explicit $z$.</description>

      <title>Zeta functions of quadratic lattices of a hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Dirichlet series that enumerates proper equivalence classes of full-rank sublattices of a given quadratic lattice in a hyperbolic plane -- that is, a nondegenerate isotropic quadratic space of dimension $2$. We derive explicit formulas for the associated zeta functions and obtain a combinatorial way to compute them. Their analytic properties lead to the intriguing consequence that a large proportion of proper classes are one-lattice classes.</description>

      <title>Weighted averages of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ automorphic kernel, Part I: non-oscillatory functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a theorem that evaluates weighted averages of sums parametrized by congruence subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. In the proof, spectral methods are applied directly to the automorphic kernel instead of going over sums of Kloosterman sums. For number theoretical applications this better preserves the specific symmetries throughout the application of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>On the greatest prime factor and uniform equidistribution of quadratic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the greatest prime factor of $n^2+h$ is at least $n^{1.312}$ infinitely often. This gives an unconditional proof for the range previously known under the Selberg eigenvalue conjecture. Furthermore, we get uniformity in $h \leq n^{1+o(1)}$ under a natural hypothesis on real characters. The same uniformity is obtained for the equidistribution of the roots of quadratic congruences modulo primes. We also prove a variant of the divisor problem for $ax^2+by^3$, which was used by the second author to give a conditional result about primes of that shape.</description>

      <title>A new pointwise bound for $3$-torsion of class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ellenberg--Venkatesh proved in 2007 that $h_3(d) \ll_\epsilon |d|^{1/3 + \epsilon}$, where $h_3(d)$ denotes the size of the $3$-torsion of the class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$. We improve this bound to $h_3(d) \ll_\epsilon |d|^{\kappa + \epsilon}$ with $\kappa \approx 0.3193 \cdots$. We also combine our methods with work of Heath-Brown--Pierce to give new bounds for average $\ell$-torsion of real quadratic fields.</description>

      <title>On the exponents of distribution of primes and smooth numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that both primes and smooth numbers are equidistributed in arithmetic progressions to moduli up to $x^{5/8 - o(1)}$, using triply-well-factorable weights for the primes (we also get improvements for the well-factorable linear sieve weights). This completely eliminates the dependency on Selberg's eigenvalue conjecture in previous works of Lichtman and the author, which built in turn on results of Maynard and Drappeau. We rely on recent large sieve inequalities for exceptional Maass forms of the author for additively-structured sequences, and on a related result of Watt for multiplicatively-structured sequences. As applications, we prove refined upper bounds for the counts of twin primes and consecutive smooth numbers up to $x$.</description>

      <title>On Minimal Generating Sets of Splitting Field and Cluster Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of cluster towers was introduced by the second author and Krithika in [4] along with a question which was answered by the first author and Bhagwat in [1]. In this article we introduce the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting field and connect it to the concept of cluster towers. We establish that there exist infinitely many irreducible polynomials over rationals for which the splitting field has two extreme minimal generating sets (one of given cardinality and other of minimum cardinality) and for which we have two extreme cluster towers (one of given length and other of minimum length). We prove interesting properties of cluster tower associated with minimal generating set that we constructed in proof of the theorem and as a consequence get that degree sequence depends on the ordering even when we work with minimal generating set. We also establish an equivalent condition for a set to be minimum minimal generating set for a certain family of polynomials over rationals and count the total number of minimum minimal generating sets.</description>

      <title>Rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ when $N$ is non-squarefree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a non-squarefree integer such that the quotient $X_0(N)^*$ of the modular curve $X_0(N)$ by the full group of Atkin-Lehner involutions has positive genus. We establish an integrality result for the $j$-invariants of non-cuspidal rational points on $X_0(N)^*$, representing a significant step toward resolving a key subcase of Elkies' conjecture. To this end, we prove the existence of rank-zero quotients of certain modular Jacobians $J_0(pq)$. Furthermore, we provide a conjecturally complete classification of the rational points on $X_0(N)^*$ of genus $1 \leq g \leq 5$. In the process we identify exceptional rational points on $X_0(147)^*$ and $X_0(75)^*$ which were not known before.</description>

      <title>On the Beilinson-Bloch conjecture over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let k be a field and X a smooth projective variety over k. When k is a number field, the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture relates the ranks of the Chow groups of X to the order of vanishing of certain L-functions. We consider the same conjecture when k is a global function field, and give a criterion for the conjecture to hold for X, extending an earlier result of Jannsen. As an application, we provide a new proof of a theorem of Geisser connecting the Tate conjecture over finite fields and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture over function fields. We then prove the Tate conjecture for a product of a smooth projective curve with a power of a CM elliptic curve over any finitely generated field, and thus deduce special cases of the Beilinson--Bloch conjecture. In the process we obtain a conditional answer to a question of Moonen on the Chow groups of powers of ordinary CM elliptic curves over arbitrary fields.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of idempotent-sum subsequences in finite cyclic semigroups and smooth sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enumeration of zero-sum subsequences of a given sequence over finite cyclic groups is one classical topic, which starts from one question of P. Erd\H{o}s. In this paper, we consider this problem in a more general setting -- finite cyclic semigroups. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite cyclic semigroup. By $\textbf{e}$ we denote the unique idempotent of the semigroup $\mathcal{S}$. Let $T$ be a sequence over the semigroup $\mathcal{S}$, and let $N(T; \textbf{e})$ be the number of distinct subsequences of $T$ with sum being the idempotent $\textbf{e}$. We obtain the lower bound for $N(T; \textbf{e})$ in terms of the length of $T$, and moreover, prove that $T$ contains subsequences with some smooth-structure in case that $N(T; \textbf{e})$ is not large. Our result generalizes the theorem obtained by W. Gao [Discrete Math., 1994] on the enumeration of zero-sum subsequences over finite cyclic groups to the setting of semigroups.</description>

      <title>Generically trivial torsors under constant groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the Grothendieck-Serre question over an arbitrary base field $k$: for a smooth $k$-group scheme $G$ and a smooth $k$-variety $X$, we show that every generically trivial $G$-torsor over $X$ trivializes Zariski semilocally on $X$. This was known when $G$ is reductive or when $k$ is perfect, and to settle it in general we uncover a wealth of new arithmetic phenomena over imperfect $k$. We build our arguments on new purity theorems for torsors under pseudo-complete, pseudo-proper, and pseudo-finite $k$-groups, for instance, respectively, under wound unipotent $k$-groups, under pseudo-abelian varieties, and under the kernels $\mathrm{Ker}(i_G)$ of comparison maps $i_G$ that relate pseudo-reductive groups to restrictions of scalars of reductive groups. We then deduce an Auslander-Buchsbaum extension theorem for torsors under quasi-reductive $k$-groups; for instance, we show that torsors over $\mathbb{A}^2_k \setminus \{(0,0)\}$ under wound unipotent $k$-groups extend to torsors over $\mathbb{A}^2_k$. For a quasi-reductive $k$-group $G$, this extension theorem allows us to quickly classify $G$-torsors over $\mathbb{P}^1_k$ by an argument that already simplifies the reductive case and to establish Birkhoff, Cartan, and Iwasawa decompositions for $G(k((t)))$. We combine these new results with deep inputs from recent work on the structure of pseudo-reductive and quasi-reductive $k$-groups to show an unramifiedness statement for the Whitehead group (the unstable $K_1$-group) of a quasi-reductive $k$-group, and then use it to argue that, for a smooth $k$-group $G$ and a semilocal $k$-algebra $A$, every $G$-torsor over $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ trivial at $\{t = \infty\}$ is also trivial at $\{t = 0\}$, which is known to imply the Grothendieck--Serre conclusion via geometric arguments. To achieve all this, we develop and heavily use the structure theory of $k$-group schemes locally of finite type.</description>

      <title>When is $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is an additive $F_\sigma$ subgroup $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathrm{dim_H} (A) = \frac{1}{2}$ and $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$. However, if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a subring of $\mathbb{R}$ and there is $x \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$, then $A =\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, assuming the continuum hypothesis (CH), there is a subgroup $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ with $\mathrm{dim_H} (A) = 0$ such that $x \not\in \mathbb{Q}$ if and only if $A + x A =\mathbb{R}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. A key ingredient in the proof of this theorem consists of some techniques in recursion theory and algorithmic randomness. We believe it may lead to applications to other constructions of exotic sets of reals. Several other theorems on measurable, and especially Borel and analytic subgroups and subfields of the reals are presented. We also discuss some of these results in the $p$-adics.</description>

      <title>An ergodic approach towards an equidistribution result of Ferrero--Washington</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important ingredient in the Ferrero--Washington proof of the vanishing of cyclotomic $\mu$-invariant for Kubota--Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-functions is an equidistribution result which they established using the Weyl criterion. The purpose of our manuscript is to provide an alternative proof by adopting a dynamical approach. A key ingredient to our methods is studying an ergodic skew-product map on $\mathbb{Z}_p \times [0,1]$, which is then suitably identified as a factor of the $2$-sided Bernoulli shift on the sample space $\{0,1,2,\cdots,p-1\}^{\mathbb{Z}}$.</description>

Abstract: Shnirel'man's inequality and Shnirel'man's basis theorem are fundamental results about sums of sets of positive integers in additive number theory. It is proved that these results are inherently order-theoretic and extend to partially ordered abelian and nonabelian groups. One abelian application is an addition theorem for sums of sets of $n$-dimensional lattice points.</description>

      <title>Transcendence of ${}_3F_2(1)$ Hypergeometric Series and $L$-values of Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a certain class of hypergeometric motives, recently associated to Hecke eigenforms of weight 3 by Allen, Grove, Long, and Tu. One aspect of their results allows us to express a special $L$-value of a specific Hecke eigenform as a combination of ${}_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric series. First, we show that the $L$-function can be twisted in a predictable way so that the $L$-value of the twist can be also be written as a sum of hypergeometric series. Moreover, the hypergeometric series involved in the twist are related to a classical formula of ${}_3F_2(1)$ series due to Kummer, which we use the extend to relations between $L$-values of the eigenforms. In the process, we find a bound on the transcendence degree for certain ${}_3F_2(1)$ series. This suggests a generalization of a theorem due to W\"ustholz which provides a formula for the transcendence degree of periods on abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>On triple product $L$-functions and the fiber bundle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multi-variable zeta integrals which unfold to Euler products representing the triple product $L$-function times a product of $L$-functions with known analytic properties. We then formulate a generalization of the Poisson summation conjecture and show how it implies the analytic properties of triple product $L$-functions. Finally, we propose a strategy, the fiber bundle method, to reduce this generalized conjecture to a simpler case of the Poisson summation conjecture along with certain local compatibility statements.</description>

      <title>$p$-adic Asai and twisted triple product $L$-functions for finite slope families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a two-variable $p$-adic Asai $L$-function for a finite-slope family of Hilbert modular forms over a real quadratic field (with one component of the weight, and the cyclotomic twist variable, varying independently); and a two-variable ``twisted triple product'' $L$-function, interpolating the central $L$-value of the tensor product of such a family with a family of elliptic modular forms. The former construction generalizes a construction due to Grossi, Zerbes and the second author for ordinary families; the latter is a counterpart of the twisted triple product $L$-function of arXiv:2401.13230, but differs in that it interpolates classical $L$-values in a different range of weights, in which the dominant weight comes from the Hilbert modular form. Our construction relies on a ``nearly-overconvergent'' version of higher Coleman theory for Hilbert modular surfaces.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic Functions and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository note, we revisit several classical arithmetic functions - namely Euler's totient function, the divisor sum functions and Dedekind's $\psi$-function - within a unifying algebraic framework that highlights their connections to geometry. This framework builds on prior work involving zeta functions and M\"obius inversion. While our main goal is to provide a clear context for similar constructions in the future, we also make an original observation regarding Dedekind's $\psi$-function.</description>

      <title>On automorphisms of some semidirect product groups and ranks of Iwasawa modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime number and $k$ an imaginary quadratic field in which $p$ does not split. Based on their heuristic, Kundu and Washington posed a question which asks whether $\lambda$- and $\mu$-invariant of the anti-cyclotomic ${\Bbb Z}_p$-extension $k_{\infty}^a$ of $k$ are always trivial. Also, if $k_{\infty}^a/k$ is totally ramified, for $n\geq 1$, they showed that the $p$-part of the ideal class group of the $n$th layer of the anti-cyclotomic ${\Bbb Z}_p$-extension of $k$ is not cyclic. In this article, inspired by their paper, we study anti-cyclotomic like ${\Bbb Z}_p$-extensions, extending both the above question and Kundu-Washington's result. We show that the values of $\lambda$ of certain anti-cyclotomic like ${\Bbb Z}_p$-extensions are always even. We also show the $p$-part of the ideal class groups of certain anti-cyclotomic like ${\Bbb Z}_p$-extensions of CM-fields are always not cyclic.</description>

      <title>Finding all solutions to the KZ equations in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KZ equations are differential equations satisfied by the correlation functions (on the Riemann sphere) of two-dimensional conformal field theories associated with an affine Lie algebra at a fixed level. They form a system of complex partial differential equations with regular singular points satisfied by the $n$-point functions of affine primary fields. In [SV1] the KZ equations were identified with equations for flat sections of suitable Gauss-Manin connections, and solutions of the KZ equations were constructed in the form of multidimensional hypergeometric integrals. In [SV2] the KZ equations were considered modulo a prime number $p$, and, for rational levels, polynomial solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p$ were constructed by an elementary procedure as suitable $p$-approximations of the hypergeometric integrals. In this paper we study in detail the first nontrivial example of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$. In particular, if the level is irrational, we prove a version of the steepest descent result that relates the KZ local system to the space of functions on the critical locus of the master function. We use this result to prove the generic irreducibility of the KZ local system at any irrational level. If the level is rational, we describe all solutions of the KZ equations in characteristic $p$ by demonstrating that they all stem from the $p$-hypergeometric solutions. Finally, we prove a Lagrangian property of the subbundle of the KZ bundle spanned by the $p$-hypergeometric sections.</description>

      <title>The section conjecture for the toric fundamental group over $p$-adic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The toric fundamental group is the Tannaka dual of a category of vector bundles which become direct sums of line bundles on a finite \'etale cover. It is an extension of the \'etale fundamental group scheme by a projective limit of tori.
  Grothendieck's section conjecture for the \'etale fundamental group implies the analogous statement for the toric fundamental group. We call this the toric section conjecture. We prove that a resolution of the toric section conjecture would reduce the original one to particular cases about which more is known, mainly due to J. Stix.
  We prove that abelian varieties over $p$-adic fields satisfy the toric section conjecture, and give strong evidence that it holds for hyperbolic curves over $p$-adic fields, too.</description>
