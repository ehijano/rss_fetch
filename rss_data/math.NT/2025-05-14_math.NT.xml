      <title>The sufficient conditions for insolvability of some Diophantine equations of $n$-th degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sufficient conditions for insolvability of the Diophantine equation $\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i^{n}=bc^{n}$ ($n, m \geq 2$, $b, c\in \mathbb{N}$) in nonnegative integers are obtained for the case where the canonical decomposition of the number $c$ consists of powers of primes $p_i$ which satisfy the condition $\varphi(p_i^{k_i})\mid n$ ($p_i^{k_i }\geq 3)$ for some natural numbers $k_i$ $(i=1,2,\ldots ,l)$; $\varphi(x)$ is the Euler's totient function. Moreover, it is proved that if $b&lt; m&lt; p_i^{k_i}$ $(i=1,2,\ldots ,l)$, then this equation has no solution with natural components $x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_m$. Besides, applying only elementary methods, it is proved that the Diophantine equation $x_1^n+x_2^n=(p^{s} p_1^{s_1} p_2^{s_2}\ldots p_l^{s_l})^{n}$ (with nonnegative integers $s$, $s_i$ $(i=1,2,..,l)$) has no solution with natural components if $n\geq 3$, $p$ is a prime number, while $p_i$ is a prime such that there is a natural number $k_i$ with $\varphi(p_i^{k_i})\mid n$ $(p_i^{k_i}\geq 3)$.</description>

      <title>Auslander regularity of completed rings of $p$-adic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any smooth rigid analytic variety $X$ admits an affinoid covering $\{U_i\}$ such that the Banach algebras involved in the Fr\'echet--Stein presentation of the completed ring of differential operators D-cap$(U_i)$ are Auslander regular for each $i$. We use this result to prove projection formulae and adjunction results for coadmissible D-cap-modules.</description>

      <title>Quasimodularity and Limiting Behavior for Variations of MacMahon Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the 1920's seminal work of Major MacMahon, Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso recently introduced an infinite family of $q$-series \[
  \mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q):= \sum_{1\le n_1&lt;n_2&lt;\cdots&lt;n_t} \frac{q^{n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_t}}{(1+aq^{n_1}+q^{2n_1})(1+aq^{n_2}+q^{2n_2})\cdots (1+aq^{n_t}+q^{2n_t})} \] and proved that these functions are linear combinations of quasimodular forms. In this paper, we study a broader family of $q$-series that contains the collection $\{\mathcal{U}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb{N}}$. Using the theory of quasi shuffle algebras, we show that this extended family also lies in the algebra of quasimodular forms. Moreover, we determine the precise weights and levels of these functions, thereby making Amdeberhan--Andrews--Tauraso's result sharp. We further investigate the limiting behavior of these functions. In particular, we demonstrate that the sequence of quasimodular forms~$\{\mathcal{U}_t(1;q)\}_{t\in\mathbb{N}}$ gives an approximation for the ordinary partition function. We also establish infinitely many closed formulas for reciprocals of certain infinite products in terms of~$\mathcal{U}_{t}(a;q)$.</description>

      <title>On near superperfect numbers, the Goormaghtigh conjecture, and Mertens' theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of the divisors of $n$. Kalita and Saikia defined a number $n$ to be near superperfect if $2n+d=\sigma(\sigma(n))$ for some positive divisor $d$ of $n$. We extend some of their results about near superperfect numbers and connect these results to the Goormaghtigh conjecture and to certain products of primes similar to those which appear in Mertens' theorem. We also define type II near superperfect numbers, which are those $n$ which satisfy $2n+d=\sigma(\sigma(n))$ for some positive divisor $d$ of $\sigma(n)$, and prove analogous results about these numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\geq 3$ be a prime number. A Fermat curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ of exponent $p$ is defined by an equation of the shape $ax^p+by^p+cz^p=0$, where $a,b,c$ are non-zero rational numbers. We prove in this article that there exist infinitely many Fermat curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, of exponent $p$, pairwise non $\mathbb{Q}$-isomorphic, contradicting the Hasse principle.</description>

      <title>The modular automorphisms of quotient modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the modular automorphism group of any quotient modular curve of level $N$, with $4,9\nmid N$. In particular, we obtain some non-expected automorphisms of order 3 that appear for the quotient modular curves when the Atkin-Lehner involution $w_{25}$ belongs to the quotient modular group, such automorphisms are not necessarily defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. As a consequence of the results, we obtain the full automorphism group of the quotient modular curve $X_0^*(N^2)$, for sufficiently large $N$.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for Euler's totient function and the number of divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present relations for the Euler totient function $\varphi(n)$ and the number of divisors $\tau(n)$ in terms of finite sums of integer parts of rational numbers or greatest common divisors of pairs of integers. Some of the formulas are obtained using a relation due to Menon and the connections with the Pillai arithmetic function are outlined. The reported expressions may be useful to derive new bounds for the usual arithmetical functions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Sharpness and Limitations of Bounds on the Frobenius Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the (classical) Frobenius problem, namely the problem of finding the largest integer that cannot be represented as a nonnegative integral combination of given relatively prime (strictly) positive integers (known as the Frobenius number). We firstly compare several upper bounds on the Frobenius number, assessing their relative tightness through both theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulations. We then explore whether a general upper bound with a worst-case exponent strictly less than quadratic can exist, and formally demonstrate that such an improvement is impossible. These findings offer new insights into the structural properties of established bounds and underscore inherent constraints for future refinement.</description>

      <title>On the CM exception to a generalization of the St\'ephanois theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two classical theorems related to algebraic values of the j-invariant: Schneider's theorem and the St\'ephanois theorem. Schneider's theorem for the j-invariant states that the transcendence degree $\operatorname{trdeg} \mathbb{Q}(\tau, j(\tau)) \geq 1$ with the sole exception of CM points. In contrast, CM points do not constitute an exception to the St\'ephanois theorem, which states $\operatorname{trdeg} \mathbb{Q}(q,j(q))\geq 1$ for the Fourier expansion ($q$-expansion) of the j-invariant, for any $q$. Schneider's theorem has been generalized to higher dimensions, and in particular holds for the Igusa invariants of a genus 2 curve. These functions have Fourier expansions, but a result of St\'ephanois type is unknown. In this paper, we find that there are positive dimensional sources of exceptions to the generic behaviour expected in genus 2, and we discuss their relation to CM points. We utilize Humbert singular relations, putting them into the transcendental framework. The computations of the transcendence degree for CM points are conditional to Schanuel's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Pullbacks of Saito-Kurokawa lifts of square-free levels, their non-vanishing and the $L^2$-mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08660v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the full spectral decomposition of the pullback of a Saito-Kurokawa (SK) newform $F$ of odd, square-free level; and show that the projections onto the elements $\mathbf g \otimes \mathbf g$ of an arithmetically orthogonalized old-basis are either zero or whose squares are given by the certain $\mathrm{GL}(3)\times \mathrm{GL}(2)$ central $L$-values $L(f\otimes \mathrm{sym}^2 g, \frac{1}{2})$, where $F$ is the lift of the $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ newform $f$ and $g$ is the newform underlying $\mathbf g$. Based on this, we work out a conjectural formula for the $L^2$-mass of the pullback of $F$ via the CFKRS heuristics, which becomes a weighted average (over $g$) of the central $L$-values. We show that on average over $f$, the main term predicted by the above heuristics matches with the actual main term. We also provide several results and sufficient conditions that ensure the non-vanishing of the pullbacks.</description>

      <title>On anticyclotomic Euler and Kolyvagin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an axiomatization of the notion of ( $p$-complete) anticyclotomic Euler system for a wide class of Galois representations, including those attached to a cuspidal eigenform and to a Hida family of modular forms. Under a minimal set of assumptions, we show how to build from these data a universal Kolyvagin system for the representation and for its anticyclotomic twist. Eventually, we recover some applications to the structure of Selmer groups and Iwasawa main conjectures and we review a few concrete examples of these abstract notions that can be found in the literature.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Connection Between the Discrete Zeta Function and the Erdos-Straus Conjecture Under Mballa's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish an additive decomposition of the discrete zeta function (for $s \in \mathbb{N}^*$, $s &gt; 1$), more precisely of the function $4(\zeta(s)-1)$, as a series whose general term is of the form $1/x_n(s) + 1/y_n(s) + 1/z_n(s)$, where $x_n(s), y_n(s), z_n(s)$ are solutions of the Erdos--Straus conjecture under a personal conjecture (which I will refer to here as Mballa's Conjecture) that I formulated by parametrization in the article: arXiv:2502.20935. This connection thus builds a bridge between analysis and Egyptian fractions in general, and the Erdos--Straus conjecture in particular.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet fermion correlators, modular tensors and higher genus integration kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</description>

      <title>Signed Partitions and Rogers-Ramanujan type Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: George Andrews [\emph{Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.}, 2007, 561--573] introduced the idea of a \emph{signed partiton} of an integer; similar to an ordinary integer partitions, but where some of the parts could be negative. Further, Andrews reinterpreted the classical G\"ollnitz--Gordon partition identities in terms of signed partitions. In the present work, we provide interpretations of the sum sides of Rogers--Ramanujan type identities, including a new signed partition interpretation of the G\"ollnitz--Gordon identities, different from that of Andrews. Both analytic and bijective proofs are presented.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of double cosets and fundamental domains for the subgroups of the modular group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1340</link>
      <description>arXiv:0901.1340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As noticed by R.~Kulkarni, the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the modular group correspond bijectively to bipartite cuboid graphs. We'll explain how to recover the graph corresponding to a subgroup $G$ of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ from the combinatorics of the right action of $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on the right cosets $G\setminus\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. This gives a method of constructing nice fundamental domains (which Kulkarni calls "special polygons") for the action of $G$ on the upper half plane.
  For the classical congruence subgroups $\Gamma_0(N)$, $\Gamma_1(N)$, $\Gamma(N)$ etc. the number of operations the method requires is the index times something that grows not faster than a polynomial in $\log N$. This is roughly the square root of the number of operations required by the naive procedure. We give algorithms to locate an element of the upper half-plane on the fundamental domain and to write a given element of $G$ as a product of independent generators. We also (re)prove a few related results about the automorphism groups of modular curves. For example, we give a simple proof that the automorphism group of $X(N)$ is $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/N)/\{\pm I\}$.</description>

      <title>The Kelley--Meka bounds for sets free of three-term arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a self-contained exposition of the recent remarkable result of Kelley and Meka: if $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ has no non-trivial three-term arithmetic progressions then $\lvert A\rvert \leq \exp(-c(\log N)^{1/12})N$ for some constant $c&gt;0$.
  Although our proof is identical to that of Kelley and Meka in all of the main ideas, we also incorporate some minor simplifications relating to Bohr sets. This eases some of the technical difficulties tackled by Kelley and Meka and widens the scope of their method. As a consequence, we improve the lower bounds for finding long arithmetic progressions in $A+A+A$, where $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$.</description>

      <title>p-adic interpolation of Gauss--Manin connections on nearly overconvergent modular forms and p-adic L-functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new geometric definition of nearly overconvergent modular forms and $p$-adically interpolate the Gauss-Manin connection on this space. This can be seen as an ``overconvergent'' version of the unipotent circle action on the space of $p$-adic modular forms, as constructed by Gouv\^{e}a and Howe. This improves on results of Andreatta--Iovita and has applications to the construction of Rankin--Selberg and triple product $p$-adic $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ with Mordell--Weil rank $2$ and $p$ be an odd prime of good ordinary reduction. For every imaginary quadratic field $K$ satisfying the Heegner hypothesis, there is (subject to the Shafarevich--Tate conjecture) a line, i.e., a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodule of rank $1$, in $ E(K)\otimes \mathbb{Z}_p$ given by universal norms coming from the Mordell--Weil groups of subfields of the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$; we call it the {\it shadow line}. When the twist of $E$ by $K$ has analytic rank $1$, the shadow line is conjectured to lie in $E(\mathbb{Q})\otimes\mathbb{Z}_p$; we verify this computationally in all our examples. We study the distribution of shadow lines in $E(\mathbb{Q})\otimes\mathbb{Z}_p$ as $K$ varies, framing conjectures based on the computations we have made.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of representations for $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$ and Galois representations arising from defining ideals of modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a geometric realization of representations for $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$ by the defining ideals of rational models $\mathcal{L}(X(p))$ of modular curves $X(p)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, which gives rise to a Rosetta stone for geometric representations of $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$. The defining ideal of a modular curve, i.e., an anabelian counterpart of the Eisenstein ideal, is the anabelianization of the Jacobian of this modular curve and is a reification of the fundamental group $\pi_1$. We show that there exists a correspondence among the defining ideals of modular curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, reducible $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$-rational representations $\pi_p: \text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p) \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathcal{L}(X(p)))$ of $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$-rational Galois representations $\rho_p: \text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathcal{L}(X(p)))$ as well as their modular and surjective realization. It is an anabelian counterpart of the global Langlands correspondence for $\text{GL}(2, \mathbb{Q})$ by the \'{e}tale cohomology of modular curves as well as an anabelian counterpart of Artin's conjecture, Serre's modularity conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. It is an ideal theoretic (i.e. nonlinear) counterpart of Grothendieck's section conjecture and an ideal theoretic (i.e. nonlinear) reification of ``arithmetic theory of $\pi_1$'' expected by Weil for modular curves. It is also an anabelian counterpart of the theory of Kubert-Lang and Mazur-Wiles on the cuspidal divisor class groups and the Eisenstein ideals of modular curves.</description>

Abstract: We carry out a survey on curves defined over finite fields that are Diophantine stable; that is, with the property that the set of points of the curve is not altered under a proper field extension. First, we derive some general results of such curves and then we analyze several families of curves that happen to be Diophantine stable.</description>

Abstract: We prove lower bounds for the number of primes $p \leq N + b$ such that $p-b$ is divisible by $2^{k(N)}$ and has at most $k$ odd prime factors ($k \geq 2$), assuming $2^{k(N)} \leq N^\theta$ for some $\theta &gt; 0$ depending on $k$. The proof uses a variant of Chen's method, weighted sieves, and Elliott's results on primes in arithmetic progressions with large power-factor moduli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of meta-Fibonacci sequences $(f(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, governed by the recurrence relation $$f(n)=af(n-u_{n}-1)+bf(n-u_{n}-2),$$ where $\mathbf{u}=(u_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence with values $0,1$. Our study focuses on the properties of the sequence of quotients $h(n) = f(n+1)/f(n)$ and its set of values $\mathcal{V}(f)=\{h(n): n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ for various $\mathbf{u}$. We give a sufficient condition for finiteness of $\mathcal{V}(f)$ and automaticity of $(h(n))_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, which holds in particular when $\mathbf{u}$ is the famous Prouhet-Thue-Morse sequence. In the automatic case, a constructive approach is used, with the help of the software \texttt{Walnut}. On the other hand, we prove that the set $\cal{V}(f)$ is infinite for other special binary sequences $\mathbf{u}$, and obtain a trichotomy in its topological type when $\mathbf{u}$ is eventually periodic.</description>

  \[x_{k+2}^2 - 2 x_{k+1}^2 + x_k^2 = 2\]
  for $k = 1,2,3$, then they must be consecutive. This answers a question of J.~Richard~B\"{u}chi.</description>

      <title>The Batyrev-Manin conjecture for DM stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a sequel to a paper by the authors. We formulate a prototype of a Batyrev-Manin type conjecture for DM stacks in positive characteristic with emphasis on the wild case. The key to doing so is the notion of sectoroids, which plays a role similar to the role played by sectors in characteristic zero. We also check some compatibilities of the proposed prototype and see how it reduces to special cases. In the course of formulating the prototype, we introduce a new type of height functions, which is more general and flexible than the one we considered in the preceding paper. Examples of this new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. In appendices, we generalize construction of a moduli stack by Tonini-Yasuda and construct a morphism between stacks of twisted arcs. These results are closely related to the main text, but also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the maximal volume of empty convex bodies amidst multivariate dilates of a lacunary integer sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) be a lacunary sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition. For any fixed dimension $d \geq 1$, we establish asymptotic upper bounds for the maximal gap in the set of dilates \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha} a_n \}_{n \leq N}\) modulo 1 as $N \to \infty$, for Lebesgue--almost all dilation vectors $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in [0,1]^d$. More precisely, we prove that for any lacunary \((a_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) and Lebesgue--almost all $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, every convex set in $[0,1]^d$ of volume at least $(\log N)^{2+\varepsilon}/N$ must contain an element of the set \(\{\boldsymbol{\alpha} a_n \}_{n \leq N}\) mod 1, for all sufficiently large $N$. We also establish a generalized version of this result, where the $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure is replaced by a general measure satisfying a certain Fourier decay condition. Our result is optimal up to logarithmic factors, and recovers as a special case a recent result for dimension $d=1$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we estimate the number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-primitive points on the affine hypersurface defined by the equation $f(x_1,\ldots,x_s)=0$, where $f\in\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\dots,x_s]$ is an appropriate polynomial. In particular, we provide existence results for the case when $f$ is Dwork-regular and when $f$ is of Fermat type. Additionally, we present a proof for a recently posed conjecture. Finally, in the case where $q$ is a Fermat prime, we provide an explicit formula for the number of $\mathbb{F}_q$-primitive points on hyperplanes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wealth of information on multiloop string amplitudes is encoded in fermionic two-point functions known as Szeg\"o kernels. In this paper we show that cyclic products of any number of Szeg\"o kernels on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus may be decomposed into linear combinations of modular tensors on moduli space that carry all the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. The $\delta$-independent coefficients in these combinations carry all the dependence on the marked points and are composed of the integration kernels of higher-genus polylogarithms. We determine the antiholomorphic moduli derivatives of the $\delta$-dependent modular tensors.</description>

      <title>The birational geometry of Markov numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that all degenerations of the complex projective plane into a surface with only quotient singularities are controlled by the positive integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ of the Markov equation $$x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz.$$ It turns out that these degenerations are all connected through finite sequences of other simpler degenerations by means of birational geometry. In this paper, we explicitly describe these birational sequences and show how they are bridged among all Markov solutions. For a given Markov triple $(a,b,c)$, the number of birational modifications depends on the number of branches that it needs to cross in the Markov tree to reach the Fibonacci branch. We show that each of these branches corresponds exactly to a Mori train of the flipping universal family of a particular cyclic quotient singularity defined by $(a,b,c)$. As a byproduct, we obtain new numerical/combinatorial data for each Markov number, and new connections with the Markov conjecture (Frobenius Uniqueness Conjecture), which rely on Hirzebruch-Jung continued fractions of Wahl singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10723v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a moduli description of the ramified unitary local model of signature $(n-1,1)$ with arbitrary parahoric level structure, assuming the residue field has characteristic not equal to $2$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Smithling. Our approach involves writing down explicit equations for the special fiber and proving that they define a normal, Cohen-Macaulay scheme, which is also of independent interest. As applications, we obtain moduli descriptions for: (1) ramified unitary Pappas-Zhu local models with arbitrary parahoric level; (2) the irreducible components of their special fiber in the maximal parahoric case; (3) integral models of ramified unitary Shimura varieties with arbitrary (quasi-)parahoric level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his foundational study of $p$-adic Hodge theory, Faltings introduced the method of almost \'etale extensions to establish fundmental comparison results of various $p$-adic cohomology theories. Scholze introduced the tilting operations to study algebraic objects arising from $p$-adic Hodge theory in mixed characteristic via the Frobenius map. In this article, we prove a few results which clarify certain ring-theoretic or homological properties of the tilt of an extension between perfectoid rings treated in the construction of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras.</description>
