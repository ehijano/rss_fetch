      <title>Barrier distribution extraction via Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel method for extracting potential barrier distributions from experimental fusion cross sections. We utilize a simple Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework to model the observed cross sections as a function of energy for three nuclear systems. The GPR approach offers a flexible way to represent the experimental data, accommodating potentially complex behavior without introducing strong prior assumptions. This method is applied directly to experimental data and is compared to the traditional direct extraction technique. We discuss the advantages of GPR-based barrier distribution extraction, including the capability to quantify uncertainties and robustness to noise in the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Non-Spherical Pauli Forbidden States in Deformed Halo Nuclei: Impact on the ${}^7\mathrm{Be}+p$ Resonant States in the Particle Rotor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: An important aspect of reducing nuclear many-body problems to few-body models is the presence of Pauli forbidden (PF) states, which are excluded in fully antisymmetrized calculations. Insufficient treatments of PF states in deformed halo nuclei underscore the need for model refinement.
  Purpose: We propose a new method utilizing Nilsson states as PF states in the orthogonality condition model, and investigate the impact of PF states on the properties of resonant states.
  Method: We investigate the scattering states of ${}^8\mathrm{B}$ within the Particle Rotor Model (PRM) framework based on a deformed ${}^7\mathrm{Be}$ core and $p$ two-body model. We compare several methods for eliminating PF states and test them with the experimental data.
  Results: Our model successfully reproduces the experimental excitation function for elastic scattering cross section by properly eliminating PF states. The same calculation predicts the presence of a low-energy bump in the inelastic scattering excitation function, although its position is overestimated by about 1 MeV compared to experimental data.
  Conclusion: This study extends the applicability of the PRM, offering a comprehensive approach for exploring structures and reactions of loosely bound nuclei like ${}^8$B. Future integration with the continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method promises to further advance the research.</description>

      <title>Proton 3D reconstruction with T-odd TMD gluon densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present studies aimed at probing the 3D gluon content of the proton through spin-dependent TMD gluon densities, computed by means of the spectator-model approach. Our formalism incorporates a fit-based modulation function for the spectator mass, designed to capture longitudinal-momentum effects across a broad kinematic range. Special emphasis is placed on the time-reversal even Boer-Mulders and the time-reversal odd Sivers functions. Accurate understanding of these functions is crucial for conducting precise 3D analyses of nucleons, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts between the LHC and EIC Communities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov loop potential depending on temperature and the chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics to the hadron resonance gas at finite baryon, strangeness, and electric charge densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through model-to-data comparisons from heavy-ion collisions, it has been shown that the Quark Gluon Plasma has an extremely small shear viscosity at vanishing densities. At large baryon densities, significantly less is known about the nature of the shear viscosity from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Within heavy-ion collisions, there are three conserved charges: baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). Here we calculate the shear viscosity in two limits using perturbative QCD and an excluded-volume hadron resonance gas at finite BSQ densities. We then develop a framework that interpolates between these two limits such that shear viscosity is possible to calculate across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. We find that the pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence such that a rather non-trivial shear viscosity appears at finite densities.</description>

      <title>Wave functions of multiquark hadrons from representations of the symmetry groups $S_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Construction of the wave functions of multiquark hadrons by traditional method based on tensor products of colors, flavors, spins (and orbital) parts becomes quite complex when quark numbers grow $n=5,6...12$, as it gets difficult to satisfy requirements of Fermi statistics. Our novel approach is focused directly on representations of the permutation symmetry generators. After showing how $C_3$ is manifested in the wave functions of (excited) baryons, we use it to construct the wave functions for a set of pentaquarks and hexaquarks (n=5,6). We also have some partial results for larger systems, with $n=9$ and 12, and even beyond that as far as $n=24$.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the pion production in heavy-ion collisions and application into the neutron star matter properties</title>

Abstract: Within the framework of the quantum molecular dynamics transport model, the pion production and constraint of the high-density symmetry energy in heavy-ion collisions near threshold energy have been thoroughly investigated. The energy conservation in the decay of resonances and reabsorption of pions as well as in the inelastic nucleon-nucleon and nucleon-resonance collisions are taken into account. The isospin diffusion in the low-density region (0.2$\rho_{0}$ - 0.8$\rho_{0}$) and high-density region (1.2$\rho_{0}$ - 1.8$\rho_{0}$) is investigated by analyzing the spectra of neutron/proton and $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratios in the isotopic reactions of $^{132}$Sn + $^{124}$Sn and $^{108}$Sn + $^{112}$Sn at the incident energy of 270 MeV/nucleon, in which the symmetry energy manifests the opposite effect in the different density domain. The controversial conclusion of the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio for constraining the high-density symmetry energy by different transport models with the FOPI data has been clarified. A soft symmetry energy with the slope parameter of $L(\rho_{0}) = 42\pm 25$ MeV by using the standard error analysis within the range of $1\sigma$ is obtained by analyzing the experimental data from the S$\pi$RIT collaboration. The neutron stars with the maximal mass of 2 $M_{\odot}$ and radius of 11-13 km are obtained with the constrained symmetry energy.</description>

      <title>Significance of the refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process in the ($p$,$pd$) reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton-induced deuteron knockout reaction, ($p$,$pd$), is one of the interests in the studies for probing the deuteron-like $p$-$n$ correlation in nuclei. According to a recent study of the inclusive deuteron-induced reaction, $(d,d'x)$, the refraction effect of the deuteron has a significant effect on the elementary process, nucleon-deuteron ($N$-$d$) binary scattering inside a nucleus, of the reaction. In the paper, it is shown that proper treatment of the local $N$-$d$ relative momentum in the elementary process is crucial in $(d,d'x)$ reactions at $100$ MeV and below. In the present work, we investigate the deuteron refraction effect in the exclusive ($p$,$pd$) reactions. We also discuss the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. The refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process is taken into account by the local semiclassical approximation to the distorted waves. The results are compared with those obtained with the asymptotic momentum approximation, which is standardly applied to the distorted wave impulse approximation framework. It is shown that the refraction effect drastically changes the energy sharing distribution of the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and gives a better agreement with experimental data. In contrast, it is confirmed that the effect is negligibly small at 250 MeV. We have clarified that the deuteron refraction effect is significant in the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and the experimental data are well reproduced. The refraction effect plays a significant role in both the shape and magnitude of the ($p$,$pd$) cross section, while the effect is negligible at 250 MeV.</description>

Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art prediction for cross sections of neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) from nucleon at high neutrino energies, $E_\nu$, from 100 GeV to 1000 EeV ($10^{12}$ GeV). Our calculations are based on the latest CT18 NNLO parton distribution functions (PDFs) and their associated uncertainties. In order to make predictions for the highest energies, we extrapolate the PDFs to small $x$ according to several procedures and assumptions, thus affecting the uncertainties at ultra-high $E_\nu$; we quantify the uncertainties corresponding to these choices. Similarly, we quantify the uncertainties introduced by the nuclear corrections which are required to evaluate neutrino-nuclear cross sections for neutrino telescopes. These results can be applied to currently-running astrophysical neutrino observatories, such as IceCube and KM3NeT, as well as various future experiments which have been proposed.</description>

      <title>Collective neutrino oscillations and heavy-element nucleosynthesis in supernovae: exploring potential effects of many-body neutrino correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the $\nu p$-process and $r$-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial $\nu p$ process neutron rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron capture process as the "$\nu$i process". In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.</description>

Abstract: Till today, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains elusive despite all our efforts. This missing matter of the universe has not been observed by the already operating DM direct-detection experiments, but we can infer its gravitational effects. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are most likely to contain DM trapped to their gravitational field. This leads us to the natural assumption that compact objects might contain DM too. Among the compact objects exist in galaxies, neutron stars are considered as natural laboratories, where theories can be tested, and observational data can be received. Thus, many models of DM have proposed it's presence in those stars. In particular, in the present study we focus on two types of dark matter particles, namely fermions and bosons with a mass range of [0.01-1.5] GeV and self-interaction strength in the range [10$^{-4}$-10$^{-1}$] MeV$^{-1}$. By employing the two-fluid model, we discovered a stable area in the M-R diagram of a celestial formation consisting of neutron star matter and DM that is substantial in size. This formation spans hundreds of kilometers in diameter and possesses a mass equivalent to 100 or more times the Solar mass. To elucidate, this entity resembles an enormous celestial body of DM, with a neutron star at its core. This implies that a supramassive stellar compact entity can exist without encountering any issues of stability and without undergoing a collapse into a black hole. In any case, the present theoretical prediction can, if combined with corresponding observations, shed light on the existence of DM and even more on its basic properties.</description>

      <title>Sound velocity peak induced by the chiral partner in dense two-color QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the peak structure of the sound velocity was observed in the lattice simulation of two-color and two-flavor QCD at the finite quark chemical potential. The comparison with the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) result was undertaken, however, the ChPT failed in reproducing the peak structure. In this study, to extend the ChPT framework, we incorporate contributions of the $\sigma$ meson, that is identified as the chiral partner of pions, on top of the low-energy pion dynamics by using the linear sigma model (LSM). Based on the LSM we derive analytic expressions of the thermodynamic quantities as well as the sound velocity within a mean-field approximation. As a result, we find that those quantities are provided by sums of the ChPT results and corrections, where the latter is characterized by a mass difference between the chiral partners, the $\sigma$ meson and pion. The chiral partner contributions are found to yield a peak in the sound velocity successfully. We furthermore show that the sound velocity peak emerges only when $m_\sigma &gt;\sqrt{3}m_\pi$ and $\mu_q &gt; m_\pi$, with $m_{\sigma(\pi)}$ and $\mu_q$ being the $\sigma$ meson (pion) mass and the quark chemical potential, respectively. The correlation between the sound velocity peak and the sign of the trace anomaly is also addressed.</description>

Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. We also improve on the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion in the regime where the chemical potential is close to the mass and also in the high temperature regime. In these calculcations we use a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified.</description>
