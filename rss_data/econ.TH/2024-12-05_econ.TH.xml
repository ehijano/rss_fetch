      <title>Categorize and randomize: a model of sequential stochastic choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model stochastic choices with categorization, resulting from the preliminary step of grouping alternatives in homogenous disjoint classes. The agent randomly chooses one class among those available, then randomly picks an item within the selected class. We give a formal definition of a choice generated by this procedure, and provide a characterization. The characterizing properties allow an external observer to elicit that categorization is applied. In a more general interpretation, the model allows to describe the observed choice as the composition of independent subchoices. This composition preserves rationalizability by random utility maximization. A generalization of the model subsumes Luce model and Nested Logit.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Pen Testing (or Consumer Surplus of Deferred-Acceptance Auctions)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pen testing is the problem of selecting high-capacity resources when the only way to measure the capacity of a resource expends its capacity. We have a set of $n$ pens with unknown amounts of ink and our goal is to select a feasible subset of pens maximizing the total ink in them. We are allowed to learn about the ink levels by writing with them, but this uses up ink that was previously in the pens.
  We identify optimal and near optimal pen testing algorithms by drawing analogues to auction theoretic frameworks of deferred-acceptance auctions and virtual values. Our framework allows the conversion of any near optimal deferred-acceptance mechanism into a near optimal pen testing algorithm. Moreover, these algorithms guarantee an additional overhead of at most $(1+o(1)) \ln n$ in the approximation factor to the omniscient algorithm that has access to the ink levels in the pens. We use this framework to give pen testing algorithms for various combinatorial constraints like matroid, knapsack, and general downward-closed constraints, and also for online environments.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>
