      <title>Performance Portable Monte Carlo Neutron Transport in MCDC via Numba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a software engineering approach that allows for portability, rapid development, open collaboration, and performance for high performance computing on GPUs and CPUs is a challenge. We implement a portability scheme using the Numba compiler for Python in Monte Carlo / Dynamic Code (MC/DC), a new neutron transport application for rapid Monte Carlo methods development. Using this scheme, we have built MC/DC as a single source, single language, single compiler application that can run as a pure Python, compiled CPU, or compiled GPU solver. In GPU mode, we use Numba paired with an asynchronous GPU scheduler called Harmonize to increase GPU performance. We present performance results for a time-dependent problem on both the CPU and GPU and compare them to a production code.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Discrete Exterior Calculus Discretization and Fourier Transform of the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of fluid flow problems, specifically incompressible flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), holds fundamental significance in a range of scientific and engineering applications. Traditional numerical methods employed for solving these equations on three-dimensional (3D) meshes are commonly known for their moderate conservation properties, high computational intensity and substantial resource demands. Relying on its ability to capture the intrinsic geometric and topological properties of simplicial meshes, discrete exterior calculus (DEC) provides a discrete analog to differential forms and enables the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) on meshes.We present a hybrid discretization approach for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations based on DEC and Fourier transform (FT). An existing conservative primitive variable DEC discretization of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over surface simplicial meshes developed by Jagad et al. [1] is considered in the planar dimension while the Fourier expansion is applied in the third dimension. The test cases of three-dimensional lid-driven cavity and viscous Taylor-Green three-dimensional vortex (TGV) flows show that the simulation results using this hybrid approach are comparable to literature.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretization of Maxwell's equations in nonlinear media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple Hamiltonian modeling framework for general models in nonlinear optics is given. This framework is specialized to describe the Hamiltonian structure of electromagnetic phenomena in cubicly nonlinear optical media. The model has a simple Poisson bracket structure with the Hamiltonian encoding all of the nonlinear coupling of the fields. The field-independence of the Poisson bracket facilitates a straightforward Hamiltonian structure-preserving discretization using finite element exterior calculus. The generality and relative simplicity of this Hamiltonian framework makes it amenable for simulating a broad class of time-domain nonlinear optical problems. The main contribution of this work is a finite element discretization of Maxwell's equations in cubicly nonlinear media which is energy-stable and exactly conserves Gauss's laws. Moreover, this approach may be readily adapted to consider more general nonlinear media in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>A framework to compute resonances arising from multiple scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05563v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous natural and technological phenomena are governed by resonances. In nanophotonics, resonances often result from the interaction of several optical elements. Controlling these resonances is an excellent opportunity to provide light with properties on demand for applications ranging from sensing to quantum technologies. The inverse design of large, distributed resonators, however, is typically challenged by high computational costs when discretizing the entire system in space. Here, this limitation is overcome by harnessing prior knowledge about the individual scatterers that form the resonator and their interaction. In particular, a transition matrix multi-scattering framework is coupled with the state-of-the-art adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm to identify complex poles of the optical response function. A sample refinement strategy suitable for accurately locating a large number of poles is introduced. We tie the AAA algorithm into an automatic differentiation framework to efficiently differentiate multi-scattering resonance calculations. The resulting resonance solver allows for efficient gradient-based optimization, demonstrated here by the inverse design of an integrated exciton-polariton cavity. This contribution serves as an important step towards efficient resonance calculations in a variety of multi-scattering scenarios, such as inclusions in stratified media, periodic lattices, and scatterers with arbitrary shapes.</description>

      <title>The design, verification, and applications of Hotspice: a Monte Carlo simulator for artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Hotspice, a Monte Carlo simulation software designed to capture the dynamics and equilibrium states of Artificial Spin Ice (ASI) systems with both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) geometries. An Ising-like model is used where each nanomagnet is represented as a macrospin, with switching events driven by thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic interactions, and external fields. To improve simulation accuracy, we explore the impact of several corrections to this model, concerning for example the calculation of the dipole interaction in IP and OOP ASI, as well as the impact of allowing asymmetric rather than symmetric energy barriers between stable states. We validate these enhancements by comparing simulation results with experimental data for pinwheel and kagome ASI lattices, demonstrating how these corrections enable a more accurate simulation of the behavior of these systems. We finish with a demonstration of 'clocking' in pinwheel and OOP square ASI as an example of reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Cluster Methods with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Tensor Networks (TN) are two powerful frameworks for numerically investigating many-body systems, each offering distinct advantages. MCMC, with its flexibility and theoretical consistency, is well-suited for simulating arbitrary systems by sampling. TN, on the other hand, provides a powerful tensor-based language for capturing the entanglement properties intrinsic to many-body systems, offering a universal representation of these systems. In this work, we leverage the computational strengths of TN to design a versatile cluster MCMC sampler. Specifically, we propose a general framework for constructing tensor-based cluster MCMC methods, enabling arbitrary cluster updates by utilizing TNs to compute the distributions required in the MCMC sampler. Our framework unifies several existing cluster algorithms as special cases and allows for natural extensions. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the simulation of the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Model and the three-dimensional Ising Model. This work is dedicated to the memory of Prof. David Draper.</description>

      <title>Dissipative self-assembly of patchy particles under nonequilibrium drive: a computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biology and implemented using nanotechnology, the self-assembly of patchy particles has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for constructing complex structures that mimic natural systems with diverse functionalities. Here, we explore the dissipative self-assembly of patchy particles under nonequilibrium conditions, with the aim of overcoming the constraints imposed by equilibrium assembly. Utilizing extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we provide insight into the effects of external forces that mirror natural and chemical processes on the assembly rates and the stability of the resulting assemblies comprising $8$, $10$, and $13$ patchy particles. Implemented by a favorable bond-promoting drive in MC or a pulsed square wave potential in MD, our simulations reveal the role these external drives play in accelerating assembly kinetics and enhancing structural stability, evidenced by a decrease in the time to first assembly and an increase in the duration the system remains in an assembled state. Through the analysis of an order parameter, entropy production, bond dynamics, and interparticle forces, we unravel the underlying mechanisms driving these advancements. We also validated our key findings by simulating a larger system of $100$ patchy particles. Our comprehensive results not only shed light on the impact of external stimuli on self-assembly processes but also open a promising pathway for expanding the application by leveraging patchy particles for novel nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Single-snapshot machine learning for turbulence super resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine-learning techniques are generally considered data-hungry. However, this may not be the case for turbulence as each of its snapshots can hold more information than a single data file in general machine-learning applications. This study asks the question of whether nonlinear machine-learning techniques can effectively extract physical insights even from as little as a single snapshot of a turbulent vortical flow. As an example, we consider machine-learning-based super-resolution analysis that reconstructs a high-resolution field from low-resolution data for two-dimensional decaying turbulence. We reveal that a carefully designed machine-learning model trained with flow tiles sampled from only a single snapshot can reconstruct vortical structures across a range of Reynolds numbers. Successful flow reconstruction indicates that nonlinear machine-learning techniques can leverage scale-invariance properties to learn turbulent flows. We further show that training data of turbulent flows can be cleverly collected from a single snapshot by considering characteristics of rotation and shear tensors. The present findings suggest that embedding prior knowledge in designing a model and collecting data is important for a range of data-driven analyses for turbulent flows. More broadly, this work hopes to stop machine-learning practitioners from being wasteful with turbulent flow data.</description>

      <title>Online learning of eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for geophysical turbulence using ensemble Kalman inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use {online} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation (LES) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held (JH) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), such that for each case, the LES' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the DNS spectra (i.e., the approach is {data-efficient}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are {generalizable}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, LES with optimized closures outperform the baselines (LES with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the PDFs (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized JH significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., JH) and data-driven modeling (e.g., {online} learning with EKI) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Model for Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05114v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic limit of a discrete kinetic equation is intrinsically connected with the symmetry of the lattices used in construction of a discrete velocity model. On mixed lattices composed of standard lattices the sixth-order (and higher) moment is often not isotropic and thus they are insufficient to ensure correct imposition of the hydrodynamic moments. This makes the task of developing lattice Boltzmann model for transonic flows quite challenging. We address this by decoupling the physical space lattice from the velocity space lattice to construct a lattice Boltzmann model with very high isotropy. The model is entirely on-lattice like the isothermal models, achieves a Mach number of two with only $81$ discrete velocities, and admits a simple generalization of equilibrium distribution used in isothermal equilibrium. We also present a number of realistic benchmark problems to show that the lattice Boltzmann model with a limited number of velocities is not only feasible for transonic flow but is also quite simple and efficient like its subsonic counterpart.</description>

      <title>Investigating Material Interface Diffusion Phenomena through Graph Neural Networks in Applied Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting interface diffusion phenomena in materials is crucial for various industrial applications, including semiconductor manufacturing, battery technology, and catalysis. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to investigate and model material interface diffusion. We begin by collecting experimental and simulated data on diffusion coefficients, concentration gradients, and other relevant parameters from diverse material systems. The data are preprocessed, and key features influencing interface diffusion are extracted. Subsequently, we construct a GNN model tailored to the diffusion problem, with a graph representation capturing the atomic structure of materials. The model architecture includes multiple graph convolutional layers for feature aggregation and update, as well as optional graph attention layers to capture complex relationships between atoms. We train and validate the GNN model using the preprocessed data, achieving accurate predictions of diffusion coefficients, diffusion rates, concentration profiles, and potential diffusion pathways. Our approach offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of interface diffusion and provides a valuable tool for optimizing material design and engineering. Additionally, our method offers possible strategies to solve the longstanding problems related to materials interface diffusion.</description>

      <title>Multi-label Classification of Parameter Constraints in BSM Extensions using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shortcomings of the Standard Model (SM) motivate its extension to accommodate new expected phenomena, such as dark matter and neutrino masses. However, such extensions are generally more complex due to the presence of a larger number of free parameters as well as additional phenomenology. Understanding how current theoretical and experimental constraints, individually and collectively, affect the parameter spaces of new models is of utmost importance in achieving testable predictions and targeted model-building that aims to solve certain issues. We present a comprehensive approach of using Deep Learning (DL) for the multi-label classification (MLC) of theoretical and experimental limits on the two-Higgs doublet model augmented by a real singlet (N2HDM), as a representative case. This approach can be generalized to any extension beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Real-time optical gas sensing with two-dimensional materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>Optical Spiking Neurons Enable High-Speed and Energy-Efficient Optical Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) perform extensive computations using photons instead of electrons, resulting in passively energy-efficient and low-latency computing. Among various ONNs, the diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) particularly excel in energy efficiency, bandwidth, and parallelism, therefore attract considerable attention. However, their performance is limited by the inherent constraints of traditional frame-based sensors, which process and produce dense and redundant information at low operating frequency. Inspired by the spiking neurons in human neural system, which utilize a thresholding mechanism to transmit information sparsely and efficiently, we propose integrating a threshold-locking method into neuromorphic vision sensors to generate sparse and binary information, achieving microsecond-level accurate perception similar to human spiking neurons. By introducing novel Binary Dual Adaptive Training (BAT) and Optically Parallel Mixture of Experts (OPMoE) inference methods, the high-speed, spike-based diffractive optical neural network (S2NN) demonstrates an ultra-fast operating speed of 3649 FPS, which is 30 fold faster than that of reported DONNs, delivering a remarkable computational speed of 417.96 TOPS and a system energy efficiency of 12.6 TOPS/W. Our work demonstrates the potential of incorporating neuromorphic architecture to facilitate optical neural network applications in real-world scenarios for both low-level and high-level machine vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Flow and clogging of capillary droplets</title>

Abstract: Capillary droplets form due to surface tension when two immiscible fluids are mixed. We describe the motion of gravity-driven capillary droplets flowing through narrow constrictions and obstacle arrays in both simulations and experiments. Our new capillary deformable particle model recapitulates the shape and velocity of single oil droplets in water as they pass through narrow constrictions in microfluidic chambers. Using this experimentally validated model, we simulate the flow and clogging of single capillary droplets in narrow channels and obstacle arrays and find several important results. First, the capillary droplet speed profile is nonmonotonic as the droplet exits the narrow orifice, and we can tune the droplet properties so that the speed overshoots the terminal speed far from the constriction. Second, in obstacle arrays, we find that extremely deformable droplets can wrap around obstacles, which leads to decreased average droplet speed in the continuous flow regime and increased probability for clogging in the regime where permanent clogs form. Third, the wrapping mechanism causes the clogging probability in obstacle arrays to become nonmonotonic with surface tension $\Gamma$. At large $\Gamma$, the droplets are nearly rigid and the clogging probability is large since the droplets can not squeeze through the gaps between obstacles. With decreasing $\Gamma$, the clogging probability decreases as the droplets become more deformable. However, in the small-$\Gamma$ limit the clogging probability increases, since the droplets are extremely deformable and cause clogs as they wrap around the obstacles. The results from these studies are important for developing a predictive understanding of capillary droplet flows through complex and confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With significant advances in classifying and cataloguing topological matter, the focus of topological physics has shifted towards quantum control, particularly the creation and manipulation of topological phases of matter. Floquet engineering, the concept of tailoring a system by periodic fields, offers a powerful tool to manipulate electronic properties of condensed systems, and even to create exotic non-equilibrium topological states that are impossibly present in equilibrium scenarios. In this perspective, we give a brief review of recent progress in theoretical investigations of Floquet engineering topological states from effective models towards realistic materials. We show that light irradiation can realize various desired topological states through the introduction of symmetry breaking, such as first- and higher-order Weyl fermions, quadrupole topological insulator with periodic driving and disorder, quantum anomalous Hall effects with a tunable Chern number, as well as beyond. Moreover, based on first-principles calculations and Floquet theorem, we show several realistic material candidates proposed as potential hosts for promising Floquet topological states, facilitating their verification in experiments. We believe that our perspective on Floquet engineering of topological states will advance further studies of rich exotic light-induced phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>An introduction to infinite projected entangled-pair state methods for variational ground state simulations using automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12358v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks capture large classes of ground states of phases of quantum matter faithfully and efficiently. Their manipulation and contraction has remained a challenge over the years, however. For most of the history, ground state simulations of two-dimensional quantum lattice systems using (infinite) projected entangled pair states have relied on what is called a time-evolving block decimation. In recent years, multiple proposals for the variational optimization of the quantum state have been put forward, overcoming accuracy and convergence problems of previously known methods. The incorporation of automatic differentiation in tensor networks algorithms has ultimately enabled a new, flexible way for variational simulation of ground states and excited states. In this work we review the state-of-the-art of the variational iPEPS framework, providing a detailed introduction to automatic differentiation, a description of a general foundation into which various two-dimensional lattices can be conveniently incorporated, and demonstrative benchmarking results.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Entanglement of Distant Features in Adversarial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15669v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we introduce 'computational entanglement', a phenomenon in overparameterized neural networks where the model exploits noise patterns in ways conceptually linked to the effects of length contraction. More specific, our findings demonstrate that overparameterized feedforward linear networks can easily achieve zero loss by fitting random noise, even with test samples that were never encountered during training. This phenomenon accompanies length contraction, where trained and test samples converge at the same point within a spacetime diagram. Unlike most models that rely on supervised learning, our method operates unsupervised, without the need for labels or gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we show a novel application of computational entanglement: transforming adversarial examples-highly non-robuts inputs imperceptible to human observers-into outputs that are recognizable and robust. This challenges conventional views on non-robust features in adversarial example generation, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms. Our results emphasize the importance of computational entanglement for enhancing model robustness and understanding neural networks in adversarial contexts.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning in Materials Informatics: structure-property relationships through minimal but highly informative multimodal input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose simple, effective and computationally efficient transfer learning approaches for structure-property relation predictions in the context of materials, with highly informative input from different modalities. As materials properties stand from their electronic structure, representations are extracted directly from datasets of electronic charge density profile images using Neural Networks. We demonstrate transferability of the existing pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Large Language Models knowledge to physics domain data, exploring a wide set of compositions for the regression of energetics- or structure- related properties, and the role of semantic crystallographic information in the context of multimodal approaches. We test the applicability of the CLIP multimodal model, and employ as well a training protocol for building a more interpretable and versatile stacked custom solution from different pre-trained modalities. The study offers a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of descriptor identification in physical systems, shedding light on the power of multimodal transfer learning for materials property prediction, without any support of complex geometrical architectures and with potential impact on decision making for new low-cost AI methods in the field of Materials and Chemoinformatics.</description>

      <title>The \v{d}Alembert solution in hyperboloidal foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of quantum thermal machines: A gradient-based spectral method to optimize their performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>
