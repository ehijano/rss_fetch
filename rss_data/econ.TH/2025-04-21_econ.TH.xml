      <title>Highly mutually dependent unions and new axiomatizations of the Owen value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Owen value is an well-known allocation rule for cooperative games with coalition structure.In this paper, we introduce the concept of highly mutually dependent unions. Two unions in a cooperative game with coalition structure are said to be highly mutually dependent if any pair of players, with one from each of the two unions, are mutually dependent in the game.Based on this concept, we introduce two axioms: weak mutually dependent between unions and differential marginality of inter-mutually dependent unions. Furthermore, we also propose another two axioms: super inter-unions marginality and invariance across games, where the former one is based on the concept of the inter-unions marginal contribution. By using the axioms and combining with some standard axioms, we present three axiomatic characterizations of the Owen value.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Signaling Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system composed of multiple distinct service locations that aims to convince customers to join the system by providing information to customers. We cast the system's information design problem in the framework of Bayesian persuasion and describe centralized and decentralized signaling. We provide efficient methods for computing the system's optimal centralized and decentralized signaling mechanisms and derive a performance guarantee for decentralized signaling when the locations' states are independent. The guarantee states that the probability that a customer joins under optimal decentralized signaling is bounded below by the product of a strictly positive constant and the probability that a customer joins under optimal centralized signaling. The constant depends only on the number of service locations. We provide an example that shows that the constant cannot be improved. We consider an extension to more-general objectives for the system and establish that the same guarantee continues to hold. We also extend our analysis to systems where the locations' states are correlated, and again derive a performance guarantee for decentralized signaling in that setting. For the correlated setting, we prove that the guarantee's asymptotic dependence upon the number of locations cannot be substantially improved. A comparison of our guarantees for independent locations and for correlated locations reveals the influence of dependence on the performance of decentralized signaling.</description>

      <title>Price Stability and Improved Buyer Utility with Presentation Design: A Theoretical Study of the Amazon Buy Box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platforms design the form of presentation by which sellers are shown to the buyers. This design not only shapes the buyers' experience but also leads to different market equilibria or dynamics. One component in this design is through the platform's mediation of the search frictions experienced by the buyers for different sellers. We take a model of monopolistic competition and show that, on one hand, when all sellers have the same inspection costs, the market sees no stable price since the sellers always have incentives to undercut each other, and, on the other hand, the platform may stabilize the price by giving prominence to one seller chosen by a carefully designed mechanism. This calls to mind Amazon's Buy Box. We study natural mechanisms for choosing the prominent seller, characterize the range of equilibrium prices implementable by them, and find that in certain scenarios the buyers' surplus improves as the search friction increases.</description>

      <title>Auctions with Tokens: Monetary Policy as a Mechanism Design Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a repeated auction in which payments are made with a blockchain token created and initially owned by the auction designer. Unlike the ``virtual money'' previously examined in mechanism design, such tokens can be saved and traded outside the mechanism. I show that the present-discounted value of expected revenues equals that of a conventional dollar auction, but revenues accrue earlier and are less volatile. The optimal monetary policy burns the tokens used for payment, a practice common in blockchain-based protocols. I also show that the same outcome can be reproduced in a dollar auction if the auctioneer issues a suitable dollar-denominated security. This equivalence breaks down with moral hazard and contracting frictions: with severe contracting frictions the token auction dominates, whereas with mild contracting frictions the dollar auction combined with a dollar-denominated financial instrument is preferred.</description>

      <title>Designing Social Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies strategic communication in the context of social learning. Product reviews are used by consumers to learn product quality, but in order to write a review, a consumer must be convinced to purchase the item first. When reviewers care about welfare of future consumers, this leads to a conflict: a reviewer today wants the future consumers to purchase the item even when this comes at a loss to them, so that more information is revealed for the consumers that come after. We show that due to this conflict, communication via reviews is inevitably noisy, regardless of whether reviewers can commit to a communication strategy or have to resort to cheap talk. The optimal communication mechanism involves truthful communication of extreme experiences and pools the moderate experiences together.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Nash Equilibrium in Behavioral Strategies through Local Sequential Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of Nash equilibrium in behavioral strategies (NashEBS) was formulated By Nash~\cite{Nash (1951)} for an extensive-form game through global rationality of nonconvex payoff functions. Kuhn's payoff equivalence theorem resolves the nonconvexity issue, but it overlooks that one Nash equilibrium of the associated normal-form game can correspond to infinitely many NashEBSs of an extensive-form game. To remedy this multiplicity, the traditional approach as documented in Myerson~\cite{Myerson (1991)} involves a two-step process: identifying a Nash equilibrium of the agent normal-form representation, followed by verifying whether the corresponding mixed strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium of the associated normal-form game, which often scales exponentially with the size of the extensive-form game tree. In response to these challenges, this paper develops a characterization of NashEBS through the incorporation of an extra behavioral strategy profile and beliefs, which meet local sequential rationality of linear payoff functions and self-independent consistency. This characterization allows one to analytically determine all NashEBSs for small extensive-form games. Building upon this characterization, we acquire a polynomial system serving as a necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether a behavioral strategy profile is a NashEBS. An application of the characterization yields differentiable path-following methods for computing such an equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The emergence of chaos in population game dynamics induced by comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise description of population game dynamics introduced by revision protocols - an economic model describing the agent's propensity to switch to a better-performing strategy - is of importance in economics and social sciences in general. In this setting innovation or imitation of others is the force which drives the evolution of the economic system. As the continuous-time game dynamics is relatively well understood, the same cannot be said about revision driven dynamics in the discrete time. We investigate the behavior of agents in a $2\times 2$ anti-coordination game with symmetric random matching and a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. In continuous time the Nash equilibrium is attracting and induces a global evolutionary stable state. We show that in the discrete time one can construct (either innovative or imitative) revision protocol and choose a level of the time step, under which the game dynamics is Li-Yorke chaotic, inducing complex and unpredictable behavior of the system, precluding stable predictions of equilibrium. Moreover, we reveal that this unpredictability is encoded into any imitative revision protocol. Furthermore, we show that for any such game there exists a perturbed pairwise proportional imitation protocol introducing chaotic behavior of the agents for sufficiently large time step.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic and Linear Model of Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the competitive condition and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We also show that under some mild restrictions the optimal trajectory satisfies the Euler condition and a related transversality condition. The optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Under an additional convexity assumption for the two-period constraint sets, we show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that if all the two-period constraint sets are convex, then the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems. We show that for a class of linear dynamic optimization problems, known as interlinked linear dynamic optimization problems, a slightly modified version of the functional equation of dynamic programming is satisfied.</description>
