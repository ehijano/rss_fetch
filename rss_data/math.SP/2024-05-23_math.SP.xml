      <title>Enhanced area law in the Widom-Sobolev formula for the free Dirac operator in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a logarithmically enhanced area law for all R\'enyi entanglement entropies of the ground state of a free gas of relativistic Dirac fermions. Such asymptotics occur in any dimension if the modulus of the Fermi energy is larger than the mass of the particles and in the massless case at Fermi energy zero in one space dimension. In all other cases of mass, Fermi energy and dimension, the entanglement entropy grows no faster than the area of the involved spatial region. The result is established for a general class of test functions which includes the ones corresponding to R\'enyi entropies and relies on a recently proved extension of the Widom-Sobolev formula to matrix-valued symbols by the authors.</description>

      <title>Turing instabilities for three interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Turing instabilities in a general system with three interacting species. Turing instabilities describe situations when a stable steady state of a reaction system (ordinary differential equation) becomes an unstable homogeneous steady state of the corresponding reaction-diffusion system (partial differential equation). Similarly to a well-known inequality condition for Turing instabilities in a system with two species, I find a set of inequality conditions for a system with three species. Furthermore, I distinguish conditions for the Turing instability when spatial perturbations grow steadily and the Turing-Hopf instability when spatial perturbations grow and oscillate in time simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat principal bundles with dense holonomy group if the base space has Anosov geodesic flow (e.g. in negative sectional curvature).
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>

      <title>Maximal multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues in negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the first upper bound on the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues for negatively curved surfaces which is sublinear in the genus g. Our proof relies on a trace argument for the heat kernel, and on the idea of leveraging an r-net in the surface to control this trace. This last idea was introduced in [Jiang-Tidor-Yao-Zhang-Zhao, 2021] for similar spectral purposes in the context of graphs of bounded degree. Our method is robust enough to also yield an upper bound on the ``approximate multiplicity'' of eigenvalues, i.e., the number of eigenvalues in windows of size $1/\log^\beta(g)$, $\beta&gt;0$. This work provides new insights on a conjecture by Colin de Verdi{\`e}re [Colin de Verdi{\`e}re, 1986] and new ways to transfer spectral results from graphs to surfaces.</description>

      <title>The inverse spectral problem for quantum semitoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.06704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a quantum semitoric system composed of pseudodifferential  operators, Berezin-Toeplitz operators, or a combination of both, we  obtain explicit formulas for recovering, from the semiclassical  asymptotics of the joint spectrum, all symplectic invariants of the  underlying classical semitoric system.  Our formulas are based on the possibility to obtain good quantum  numbers for joint eigenvalues from the bare data of the joint  spectrum. In the spectral region corresponding to regular values of  the momentum map, the algorithms developed by Dauge, Hall and the  second author [27] produce such  labellings. In our proof, it was crucial to extend these algorithms  to the boundary of the spectrum, which led to the new notion of  asymptotic half-lattices, and to globalize the resulting labellings.  Using the construction given by Pelayo and the second author  in [79], our results prove that semitoric systems  are completely spectrally determined in an algorithmic way~: from  the joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system one can construct a  representative of the isomorphism class of the underlying classical  semitoric system. In particular, this recovers the uniqueness result  obtained by Pelayo and the authors  in [62,61], and completes  it with the explicit computation of all invariants, including the  twisting index.  In the cases of the spin-oscillator and the coupled angular momenta,  we implement the algorithms and illustrate numerically the  computation of the invariants from the joint spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the limit spectrum of a degenerate operator in the framework of periodic homogenization or singular perturbation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we perform the analysis of the spectrum of a degenerate operator $A_\var$ corresponding to the stationary heat equation in a $\var$-periodic composite medium having two components with high contrast diffusivity. We prove that although $ A_\var$ is a bounded self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent, the limits of its eigenvalues when the size $\var$ of the medium tends to zero, make up a part of the spectrum of a unbounded operator $ A_0$, namely the eigenvalues of $ A_0$ located on the left of the first eigenvalue of the bi-dimensional Laplacian with homogeneous Dirichlet condition on the boundary of the representative cell. We also show that the homogenized problem does not differ in any way from the one-dimensional problem obtained in the study of the local reduction of dimension induced by the homogenization.</description>
