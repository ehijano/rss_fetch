      <title>Bunch-by-Bunch Prediction of Beam Transverse Position, Phase, and Length in a Storage Ring Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time, bunch-by-bunch monitoring of transverse position, longitudinal phase, and bunch length is crucial for beam control in diffraction-limited storage rings, where complex collective dynamics pose unprecedented diagnostic challenges. This study presents a neural network framework that simultaneously predicts these parameters directly from beam position monitor waveforms. The hybrid architecture integrates specialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (LSTM-Attention) sub-networks, overcoming key limitations of traditional methods such as serial processing chains and batch-mode operation. Validated on experimental data from the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and Hefei Light Source, the model achieves high prediction accuracy with a sub-millisecond latency of 0.042 ms per bunch. This performance demonstrates its potential as a core tool for real-time, multi-parameter diagnostics and active feedback in next-generation light sources.</description>

      <title>Frequency Extraction from Invariant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-degenerate integrable Hamiltonian systems, invariant tori can be parameterized equivalently by action variables or by their fundamental frequencies. We introduce an invariant-flow formulation for extracting fundamental frequencies of integrable Hamiltonian systems. By treating invariants as generators of commuting Hamiltonian flows, the frequencies are obtained from time-of-flight parameters along these flows, providing a direct alternative to action-angle constructions and spectral methods based on long time series. The approach yields an explicit numerical procedure that extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using the McMillan map, where machine-precision accuracy is achieved.</description>

      <title>High-precision Beam Optics Calculation of the HIAF-BRing Using Measured Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08421v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of the High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) has been completed, with current efforts focused on subsystem commissioning. Beam commissioning is scheduled for autumn 2025, marking a critical milestone in the HIAF project. This paper presents high-precision optics calculations for the Booster Ring (BRing) of HIAF, a key component for achieving stable heavy-ion beam acceleration. Leveraging high-precision magnetic field data, each magnet is divided into hundreds of slices, thus establishing a high-precision sliced optics model for BRing. Detailed calculations of BRing's optics are presented in this work. Critical parameters including tunes and betatron functions of the lattice based on the measured magnetic fields and those of the ideal lattice have been compared. The results highlight the impact of realistic magnetic field on beam dynamics and provide essential insights for accelerator tuning and optimization. These findings serve as a fundamental reference for beam commissioning and long-term operation, ensuring beam stability and performance reproducibility in HIAF.</description>
