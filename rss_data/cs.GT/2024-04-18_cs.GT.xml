      <title>Oracle-Augmented Prophet Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical prophet inequality settings, a gambler is given a sequence of $n$ random variables $X_1, \dots, X_n$, taken from known distributions, observes their values in this (potentially adversarial) order, and select one of them, immediately after it is being observed, so that its value is as high as possible. The classical \emph{prophet inequality} shows a strategy that guarantees a value at least half of that an omniscience prophet that picks the maximum, and this ratio is optimal.
  Here, we generalize the prophet inequality, allowing the gambler some additional information about the future that is otherwise privy only to the prophet. Specifically, at any point in the process, the gambler is allowed to query an oracle $\mathcal{O}$. The oracle responds with a single bit answer: YES if the current realization is greater than the remaining realizations, and NO otherwise. We show that the oracle model with $m$ oracle calls is equivalent to the \textsc{Top-$1$-of-$(m+1)$} model when the objective is maximizing the probability of selecting the maximum. This equivalence fails to hold when the objective is maximizing the competitive ratio, but we still show that any algorithm for the oracle model implies an equivalent competitive ratio for the \textsc{Top-$1$-of-$(m+1)$} model.
  We resolve the oracle model for any $m$, giving tight lower and upper bound on the best possible competitive ratio compared to an almighty adversary. As a consequence, we provide new results as well as improvements on known results for the \textsc{Top-$1$-of-$m$} model.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Analysis of the Ascending Auction to Sell a Matroid Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simpler analysis of the ascending auction of Bikhchandani, de Vries, Schummer, and Vohra to sell a welfare-maximizing base of a matroid at Vickrey prices. The new proofs for economic efficiency and the charge of Vickrey prices only require a few matroid folklore theorems, therefore shortening the analysis of the design goals of the auction significantly.</description>

      <title>Testing the simplicity of strategy-proof mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper experimentally evaluates four mechanisms intended to achieve the Uniform outcome in rationing problems (Sprumont, 1991). Our benchmark is the dominant-strategy, direct-revelation mechanism of the Uniform rule. A strategically equivalent mechanism that provides non-binding feedback during the reporting period greatly improves performance. A sequential revelation mechanism produces modest improvements despite not possessing dominant strategies. A novel, obviously strategy-proof mechanism, devised by Arribillaga et al. (2023), does not improve performance. We characterize each alternative to the direct mechanism, finding general lessons about the advantages of real-time feedback and sequentiality of play as well as the potential shortcomings of an obviously strategy-proof mechanism.</description>

      <title>Accounting for AI and Users Shaping One Another: The Role of Mathematical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems enter into a growing number of societal domains, these systems increasingly shape and are shaped by user preferences, opinions, and behaviors. However, the design of AI systems rarely accounts for how AI and users shape one another. In this position paper, we argue for the development of formal interaction models which mathematically specify how AI and users shape one another. Formal interaction models can be leveraged to (1) specify interactions for implementation, (2) monitor interactions through empirical analysis, (3) anticipate societal impacts via counterfactual analysis, and (4) control societal impacts via interventions. The design space of formal interaction models is vast, and model design requires careful consideration of factors such as style, granularity, mathematical complexity, and measurability. Using content recommender systems as a case study, we critically examine the nascent literature of formal interaction models with respect to these use-cases and design axes. More broadly, we call for the community to leverage formal interaction models when designing, evaluating, or auditing any AI system which interacts with users.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Non-Truthful Auctions in Auto-bidding with Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the efficiency of non-truthful auctions for auto-bidders with both return on spend (ROS) and budget constraints. The efficiency of a mechanism is measured by the price of anarchy (PoA), which is the worst case ratio between the liquid welfare of any equilibrium and the optimal (possibly randomized) allocation. Our first main result is that the first-price auction (FPA) is optimal, among deterministic mechanisms, in this setting. Without any assumptions, the PoA of FPA is $n$ which we prove is tight for any deterministic mechanism. However, under a mild assumption that a bidder's value for any query does not exceed their total budget, we show that the PoA is at most $2$. This bound is also tight as it matches the optimal PoA without a budget constraint. We next analyze two randomized mechanisms: randomized FPA (rFPA) and "quasi-proportional" FPA. We prove two results that highlight the efficacy of randomization in this setting. First, we show that the PoA of rFPA for two bidders is at most $1.8$ without requiring any assumptions. This extends prior work which focused only on an ROS constraint. Second, we show that quasi-proportional FPA has a PoA of $2$ for any number of bidders, without any assumptions. Both of these bypass lower bounds in the deterministic setting. Finally, we study the setting where bidders are assumed to bid uniformly. We show that uniform bidding can be detrimental for efficiency in deterministic mechanisms while being beneficial for randomized mechanisms, which is in stark contrast with the settings without budget constraints.</description>

      <title>Predicting human decisions with behavioral theories and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.06866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting human decision-making under risk and uncertainty represents a quintessential challenge that spans economics, psychology, and related disciplines. Despite decades of research effort, no model can be said to accurately describe and predict human choice even for the most stylized tasks like choice between lotteries. Here, we introduce BEAST Gradient Boosting (BEAST-GB), a novel hybrid model that synergizes behavioral theories, specifically the model BEAST, with machine learning techniques. First, we show the effectiveness of BEAST-GB by describing CPC18, an open competition for prediction of human decision making under risk and uncertainty, in which BEAST-GB won. Second, we show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the largest publicly available dataset of human risky choice, outperforming purely data-driven neural networks, indicating the continued relevance of BEAST theoretical insights in the presence of large data. Third, we demonstrate BEAST-GB's superior predictive power in an ensemble of choice experiments in which the BEAST model alone falters, underscoring the indispensable role of machine learning in interpreting complex idiosyncratic behavioral data. Finally, we show BEAST-GB also displays robust domain generalization capabilities as it effectively predicts choice behavior in new experimental contexts that it was not trained on. These results confirm the potency of combining domain-specific theoretical frameworks with machine learning, underscoring a methodological advance with broad implications for modeling decisions in diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Training beyond Zero-Sum with Correlated Equilibrium Meta-Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.09435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-player, constant-sum games are well studied in the literature, but there has been limited progress outside of this setting. We propose Joint Policy-Space Response Oracles (JPSRO), an algorithm for training agents in n-player, general-sum extensive form games, which provably converges to an equilibrium. We further suggest correlated equilibria (CE) as promising meta-solvers, and propose a novel solution concept Maximum Gini Correlated Equilibrium (MGCE), a principled and computationally efficient family of solutions for solving the correlated equilibrium selection problem. We conduct several experiments using CE meta-solvers for JPSRO and demonstrate convergence on n-player, general-sum games.</description>

      <title>Value Approximation for Two-Player General-Sum Differential Games with State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) PDEs numerically enables equilibrial feedback control in two-player differential games, yet faces the curse of dimensionality (CoD). While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in alleviating CoD in solving PDEs, vanilla PINNs fall short in learning discontinuous solutions due to their sampling nature, leading to poor safety performance of the resulting policies when values are discontinuous due to state or temporal logic constraints. In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this challenge: (1) a hybrid learning method that is guided by both supervisory equilibria and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional state space where it becomes continuous. Evaluations through 5D and 9D vehicle and 13D drone simulations reveal that the hybrid method outperforms others in terms of generalization and safety performance by taking advantage of both the supervisory equilibrium values and costates, and the low cost of PINN loss gradients.</description>
