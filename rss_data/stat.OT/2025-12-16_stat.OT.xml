      <title>Data-driven inverse uncertainty quantification: application to the Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a Bayesian framework for (inverse) uncertainty quantification and parameter estimation in a two-step Chemical Vapor Deposition coating process using production data. We develop an XGBoost surrogate model that maps reactor setup parameters to coating thickness measurements, enabling efficient Bayesian analysis while reducing sampling costs. The methodology handles a mixture of data including continuous, discrete integer, binary, and encoded categorical variables. We establish parameter prior distributions through Bayesian Model Selection and perform Inverse Uncertainty Quantification via weighted Approximate Bayesian Computation with summary statistics, providing robust parameter credible intervals while filtering measurement noise across multiple reactor locations. Furthermore, we employ clustering methods guided by geometry embeddings to focus analysis within homogeneous production groups. This integrated approach provides a validated tool for improving industrial process control under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Real Data-Driven, Robust Survival Analysis on Patients who Underwent Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease by Utilizing Parametric, Non-Parametric, and Semi-Parametric Approaches</title>

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people around the globe. Many researchers are continuously working to understand PD and develop treatments to improve the condition of PD patients, which affects their day-to-day lives. Since the last decades, the treatment, Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has given promising results for motor symptoms by improving the quality of daily living of PD patients. In the methodology of the present study, we have utilized sophisticated statistical approaches such as Nonparametric, Semi-parametric, and robust Parametric survival analysis to extract useful and important information about the long-term survival outcomes of the patients who underwent DBS for PD. Finally, we were able to conclude that the probabilistic behavior of the survival time of female patients is statistically different from that of male patients. Furthermore, we have identified that the probabilistic behavior of the survival times of Female patients is characterized by the 3-parameter Lognormal distribution, while that of Male patients is characterized by the 3-parameter Weibull distribution. More importantly, we have found that the Female patients have higher survival compared to the Male patients after conducting a robust parametric survival analysis. Using the semi-parametric COX-PH, we found that the initial implant of the right side leads to a high frequency of events occurring for the female patients with a bad prognostic factor, while for the male patients, a low events occurs with a good prognostic factor. Furthermore, we have found an interaction term between the number of revisions and the initial size of the implant, which increases the frequency of events occurring for the Male patients with a bad prognostic factor.</description>

      <title>CBDC Stress Test in a Dual-Currency Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13384v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential impact of introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on financial stability in an emerging dual-currency economy (Romania), where the domestic currency (RON) coexists with the euro. It develops an integrated analytical framework combining econometrics, machine learning, and behavioural modelling. CBDC adoption probabilities are estimated using XGBoost and logistic regression models trained on behavioural and macro-financial indicators rather than survey data. Liquidity stress simulations assess how banks would respond to deposit withdrawals resulting from CBDC adoption, while VAR, MSVAR, and SVAR models capture the macro-financial transmission of liquidity shocks into credit contraction and changes in monetary conditions. The findings indicate that CBDC uptake (co-circulating Digital RON and Digital EUR) would be moderate at issuance, amounting to around EUR 1 billion, primarily driven by digital readiness and trust in the central bank. The study concludes that a non-remunerated, capped CBDC, designed primarily as a means of payment rather than a store of value, can be introduced without compromising financial stability. In dual currency economies, differentiated holding limits for domestic and foreign digital currencies (e.g., Digital RON versus Digital Euro) are crucial to prevent uncontrolled euroisation and preserve monetary sovereignty. A prudent design with moderate caps, non remuneration, and macroprudential coordination can transform CBDC into a digital liquidity buffer and a complementary monetary policy instrument that enhances resilience and inclusion rather than destabilising the financial system.</description>
