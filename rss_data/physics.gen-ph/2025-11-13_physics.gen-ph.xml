      <title>The chanciness of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital network failures stemming from instabilities in measurements of temporal order motivate attention to concurrent events. A century of attempts to resolve the instabilities have never eliminated them. Do concurrent events occur at indeterminate times, or are they better seen as events to which the very concept of temporal order cannot apply? Logical dependencies of messages propagating through digital networks can be represented by marked graphs on which tokens are moved in formal token games. However, available mathematical formulations of these token games invoke "markings"-- global snapshots of the locations of tokens on the graph. The formulation in terms of global snapshots is misleading, because distributed networks are never still: they exhibit concurrent events inexpressible by global snapshots. We reformulate token games used to represent digital networks so as to express concurrency. The trick is to replace global snapshots with "local snapshots." Detached from any central clock, a local snapshot records an action at a node during a play of a token game. Assemblages of local records define acyclic directed graphs that we call history graphs. We show how history graphs represent plays of token games with concurrent motions, and, importantly, how history graphs can represent the history of a network operating while undergoing unpredictable changes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum mechanical state of one electron can be presented as a superposition of eigenfunctions marked by various types of quantum numbers (momentum, angular momentum, etc.) There exist the eigenfunctions, referred to as anomalous, which strongly oscillate in space regardless of electron energy. Fluctuation fields smear out the short range structure making the anomalous state fluctuation mediated in a non-perturbative way. Thus the resulting anomalous state is like a strong coupling polaron, whereas the conventional state is almost free. This natural separation leads to two independent types of fermions: conventional and anomalous. The analysis of experiments on pair production by photon shows that the photon cannot create a pair of anomalous electron and positron. This is possible, when the anomalous vacuum is pairless in contrast to the conventional electron-positron vacuum. The creation of anomalous fermions is a non-trivial experimental task but it results in gamma emission due to transitions to low lying anomalous levels.</description>
