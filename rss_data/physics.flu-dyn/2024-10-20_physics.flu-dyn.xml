      <title>Machine Learning-Based Estimation of Superdroplet Growth Rates Using DNS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet growth and size spectra play a crucial role in the microphysics of atmospheric clouds. However, it is challenging to represent droplet growth rate accurately in cloud-resolving models such as Large Eddy Simulations (LESs). The assumption of "well-mixed" condition within each grid cell, often made by traditional LES solvers, typically falls short near the edges of clouds, where sharp gradients in water vapor supersaturation occur. This under-resolution of supersaturation gradients can lead to significant errors in prediction of droplet growth rate, which in turn affects the prediction of buoyancy at cloud edges, as well as forecast of precipitation. In "superdroplet" based LES model, a Lagrangian coarse-graining approach groups multiple droplets into superdroplets, each encompassing a specific number and size of actual droplets. The superdroplets are advected by the underlying LES velocity field, and the growth rate of these superdroplets is based on the filtered supersaturation field represented by the LES. To overcome the limitations of the "well-mixed" assumption, we propose a parameterization for superdroplet growth using high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data. We introduce a novel clustering algorithm to map droplets in DNS fields to superdroplets. The effective supersaturation at each superdroplet location is computed by averaging the unfiltered supersaturation of the associated droplets, which may differ from the value of filtered supersaturation at the superdroplet location. We then develop a machine learning-based parameterization to relate the effective growth rate of superdroplets to other filtered DNS flow variables. Preliminary results show a promising $R^2$ value of nearly 0.9 between the predicted and true effective supersaturation values for the superdroplets, for a range of superdroplet multiplicities.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear ODE System for the Unsteady Hydrodynamic Force -- A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reduced-order model for the instantaneous hydrodynamic force on a cylinder. The model consists of a system of two ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be integrated in time to yield very accurate histories of the resultant force and its direction. In contrast to several existing models, the proposed model considers the actual (total) hydrodynamic force rather than its perpendicular or parallel projection (the lift and drag), and captures the complete force rather than the oscillatory part only. We study and provide descriptions of the relationship between the model parameters, evaluated utilizing results from numerical simulations, and the Reynolds number so that the model can be used at any arbitrary value within the considered range of 100 to 500 to provide accurate representation of the force without the need to perform time-consuming simulations and solving the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the flow field.</description>

      <title>Sheltering effect of various wave energy converter archetypes for offshore wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave energy converter farms have the potential to reduce wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbines, reducing material, production, transportation, and installation costs. Wave energy converters (WECs) dampen incoming waves, producing a sheltering effect for downstream bodies. This work compares the sheltering effect of three wave energy converter architectures and one floating breakwater. The near-field wave-body interactions and the far-field energy balance are modeled using linear potential flow theory in a boundary element method solver coupled with a spectral action balance model. Array interactions as well as the effect of different WEC control schemes on the wave field are also investigated. Finally, a relationship between wave height reduction and reduction in fatigue damage over the turbine lifetime is defined. Near-field interactions affected the far-field performance between 5% and 60% depending on configuration, control scheme, and architecture. The six-body arrays of oscillating surge, point absorber, and breakwater architectures performed similarly, providing up to 5.70% wave height reduction after 0.5 nautical miles. Finally, small reductions in wave height (2%) were observed to have large reductions in monopile fatigue damage due to wave loading over the turbine lifetime (10%).</description>

      <title>Research on the identification of the two-phase flow pattern of gas-liquid in a vertical rising tube based on BP neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the identification of the two-phase flow pattern of gas-liquid in a vertical rising pipe is of great significance for improving the production capacity and production efficiency of the petrochemical industry. In order to address the problem of the accuracy of the identification of the two-phase flow pattern of gas-liquid, this paper proposes a method for identifying the two-phase flow pattern of gas-liquid in a vertical rising pipe based on BP neural networks. In the study, the Fluent software was used to numerically simulate different two-phase flow velocities. The pipes were all constructed as vertical rising pipes with an inner diameter of 20 mm and a length of 2000 mm. Three flow pattern cloud diagrams and their related data were obtained for bubble flow, elastic flow, and annular flow. The gas content of the three flow types was used to collect data to form a database. The BP neural network was used to classify and identify the three flow patterns, but the result was only 90.73%. We again used the Adam algorithm to optimise the BP neural network and regularise it, and the flow pattern recognition result reached 96.68%, which was a better recognition</description>

      <title>Proppant transport at the intersection of coal cleats and hydraulic fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is the first computational study of proppant leak-off through coal cleats that accounts for proppant retention in cleats, occlusion formation at cleat entrances, the resulting control of fluid leak-off, and the influence of realistic cleat roughness on these factors. Suspensions are simulated with a coupled lattice Boltzmann method-discrete element method, which explicitly models all physics, including shear-thinning fluid rheology. Firstly, using a simplified computational geometry, it is demonstrated that leak-off and mounding are both minimised when proppant invades and is retained in the cleat. This occurs most effectively with wide proppant size distributions, such as 100/635 mesh. However, when the proppant is larger than the cleat aperture, occlusions form at the cleat entrance, which can lead to significant mounding; this is observed for 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh. These findings are commensurate with an existing benchmark experiment. The present study additionally demonstrates that mounding is significantly reduced for shear-thinning fluids compared to Newtonian fluids. Simulations are then conducted with rough cleats in a realistic fracture channel. Leak-off is smallest for high cleat roughness and when cleats are narrower than a critical width, while proppant retention is largest at the same critical width but only above a certain roughness. Mounding is primarily dependent on the width, as opposed to the roughness. These results are presented as high-fidelity maps which can be directly incorporated into hydraulic fracturing simulations for improved predictions of fluid leak-off and propped reservoir volumes, and which can be tailored for different treatment and reservoir conditions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking of two-layer eastward propagating dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of eastward propagating dipoles (modons) on sloping topography in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic $\beta$-plane model using high-resolution numerical simulations. Various combinations of background gradients of potential vorticity in the upper and lower layers shed light on the recently discovered breakdown mechanisms and rich dynamics of dipolar vortices. Owing to the beta-effect in the upper layer with active dipolar vortices, the symmetry of dipole flow breaks due to an exponentially-growing, rotating, asymmetric mode of linear instability associated with Rossby wave radiation. After nonlinear fast partner separation, resulting in deceleration of the eastward drift, further slow separation with saturated asymmetric mode and much weaker shorter Rossby waves is found. Conversely, when no $\beta$-effect is present in the upper layer on the $f$-plane, the dipoles remain nearly symmetric, even when the topographic beta-effect is present in the active lower layer. Then appearing weak asymmetric mode is well described by a small meridional shifting of the dipole center on the numerical grid.</description>

      <title>Bubble curtains for noise mitigation: one vs. two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubble curtains are widely used to protect marine life from exposure to noise during offshore construction. However, operating a bubble curtain is costly. Therefore optimizing the acoustic effect of the available air is important. An interesting approach is to split the airflow rate into two separate bubble curtains, rather than one single curtain. This concept is tested experimentally and numerically. The experiments and the model show an increase in performance of the compressed air when it is split between two manifolds. An increased insertion loss of up to 11dB is measured. This increase in performance is possibly due to the fact that the reflective properties of the bubble curtains are maintained when halving the airflow rate. In effect, by splitting the airflow a second acoustic barrier is added. Additionally, the variations in the bubble curtain performance between individual measurements are shown to be largely caused by temporal variations in the air distribution. The applicability of equivalent fluid models for bubble curtains is discussed, and it is shown that accounting for a gap in the bubble curtain, close to the manifold where the bubble curtain is not fully developed, results in better agreement between the modelled and the measured insertion loss.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-assisted Blending of Data-Driven Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine learning-based methodology for blending data-driven turbulent closures for the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is proposed to improve the generalizability across different flow scenarios. Data-driven models based on sparse Bayesian learning and symbolic regression are pre-trained for specific flow classes, including turbulent channel flows, separated flows, and axisymmetric jets. The specialized models (called "\textit{experts}") are then blended using a set of weighting functions that reflect the local likelihood of a model to capture the reference data. The weighting functions are expressed as functions of a set of local flow features, and Random Forest regressors (RFR) are trained alongside the expert models to learn the mapping between the features and the weights. The training dataset includes additional data for flows ranging from shear flows at equilibrium to separated flows. The resulting blended model is then used to predict unseen flows, including a turbulent zero-pressure-gradient flat plate and a wall-mounted hump involving attached and separated boundary layer regions. The results show that the blending strategy adapts to the local flow conditions and effectively leverages the strengths of individual models, promoting the best-performing models locally, in a manner consistent with the training scenarios. The blended model provides a robust approximation for unseen flows that exhibit similar underlying physical characteristics to the training cases, while also successfully extrapolating to flows with different geometries and physical configurations.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.</description>

      <title>Wall-damped Faraday waves in horizontally oscillating two-layer fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally the onset of Faraday waves near the endwalls of rectangular vessel containing two stably-stratified fluid layers, subject to horizontal oscillations. These subharmonic waves (SWs) are excited, because the horizontal inertial forcing drives a harmonic propagating wave which displaces the interface in the vertical direction at the endwalls. We find that the onset of SWs is regulated by a balance between capillary and viscous forces, where the rate of damping is set by the Stokes layer thickness at the wall rather than the wavelength of the SWs. We model the onset of SWs with a weakly-damped Mathieu equation and find that the dimensional critical acceleration scales as $\nu_m^{1/2} \omega^{3/2}$, where $\nu_m$ is the mean viscosity and $\omega$ is the frequency of forcing, in excellent agreement with the experiment over a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Dissecting inertial clustering and sling dynamics in high-Reynolds number particle-laden turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of inertial clustering and the role of sling events in high-Reynolds number ($Re$) particle-laden turbulence. To this end, we perform one-way coupled particle tracking in flow fields obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Additionally, we examine the impact of filtering utilized in large eddy simulations (LES) by applying a sharp spectral filter to the DNS fields. Our analysis reveals that while instantaneous clustering through the centrifuge mechanism explains clustering at early times, the path history effect--the sampling of fluid flow along particle trajectories--becomes important later on. The filtered fields expose small-scale fractal clustering that cannot be predicted by the instantaneous flow field. We show that there exists a filter-effective Stokes number that governs the degree of fractal clustering and preferential sampling, revealing scale-similarity in the spatial distributions and fractal dimensions. Sling events are prevalent throughout our simulations and impose prominent patterns on the particle fields. In pursuit of investigating the sling dynamics, we compute the relative velocity, ensemble-averaged over proximal neighboring particles, to identify particles undergoing caustics. As postulated in recent theories, we find that in fully resolved, high-$Rea turbulence, sling events occur in thin sheets of high strain, situated between turbulent vortices. This behavior is driven by rare, extreme events of compressive straining, manifested by fluctuations of the flow velocity gradients that propagate back and forth the positive branch of the Vieillefosse line.</description>

      <title>Interactions between the near-wall turbulent structures and heavy particles in compressible turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we conduct direct numerical simulations to investigate the near-wall dynamics of compressible turbulent boundary layers at the free-stream Mach number of 6 laden with heavy particles. By inspecting the instantaneous near-wall flow structures, Reynolds stresses and the impacts of particle forces on solenoidal and dilatational motions, we observed that higher particle mass loadings lead to the less meandering yet almost equally intense velocity streaks, but the weakened wall-normal velocity fluctuations induced by vortices and near-wall dilatational motions organized as travelling wave packets. The strong correlation between the particle force and dilatational velocities indicates that particles are accelerated/decelerated while travelling through these travelling wave packets composed of expansive and compressive events, and in return, leading to the weakened dilatational motions of the fluid during this process. This correlation further supports the elucidation by Yu et al. (J. Fluid. Mech., vol. 984, 2024, pp. A44) that dilatational motions are generated by the vortices that induce strong bursting events, rather than the evolving perturbations beneath the velocity streaks. Nevertheless, the variation of skin friction in the presently considered cases with moderate mass loadings, either increased or decreased by the presence of particles, is found to be primarily attributed to the solenoidal Reynolds shear stress as in incompressible turbulence, suggesting the essentially unaltered nature of wall-bounded turbulence populated by vortical and shear motions instead of gradually switching to the state dominated by dilatational motions.</description>

      <title>Variable-property and intrinsic compressibility corrections for turbulence models using near-wall scaling theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to derive compressibility corrections for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. Using this approach, we derive variable-property corrections for wall-bounded flows that are consistent with the semi-local velocity transformation in the inner layer and the Van Driest velocity transformation in the outer layer. We also propose modifying the eddy viscosity to account for changes in the near-wall damping of turbulent shear stress caused by intrinsic compressibility effects. Furthermore, we address some important aspects related to the modeling of the energy equation, primarily focusing on the turbulent Prandtl number and the modeling of the source terms. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art compressibility corrections, the present corrections, combined with accurate modeling of the energy equation, lead to a significant improvement in the results for a wide range of turbulent boundary layers and channel flows. The proposed corrections have the potential to enhance modeling across a range of applications, involving low-speed flows with strong heat transfer, fluids at supercritical pressures, and supersonic and hypersonic flows.</description>

      <title>Semi-Implicit Lagrangian Voronoi Approximation for Compressible Viscous Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the recent investigations of Lagrangian methods based on Voronoi meshes. The aim is to design a new conservative numerical scheme that can simulate complex flows and multi-phase problems with more accuracy than SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) methods but, unlike diffuse interface models on fixed grid topology, does not suffer from the deteriorating quality of the computational grid. The numerical solution is stored at particles, which move with the fluid velocity and also play the role of the generators of the computational mesh, that is efficiently re-constructed at each time step. The main novelty stems from combining a Lagrangian Voronoi scheme with a semi-implicit integrator for compressible flows. This allows to model low-Mach number flows without the extremely stringent stability constraint on the time step and with the correct scaling of numerical viscosity. The implicit linear system for the unknown pressure is obtained by splitting the reversible from the irreversible (viscous) part of the dynamics, and then using entropy conservation of the reversible sub-system to derive an auxiliary elliptic equation. The method, called SILVA (Semi-Implicit Lagrangian Voronoi Approximation), is validated in a variety of test cases that feature diverse Mach numbers, shocks and multi-phase flows.</description>

      <title>Completing Moody's friction diagram in the turbulent transitional regime</title>

Abstract: The Moody diagram, a plot of friction factor versus flow rate, is a well-known engineering tool for estimating head loss in pipe flows. It comprises well-defined relationships between friction factor and flow rate over the majority of parameter space, but there is a gap in the transitional regime between laminar and turbulent flows. It is often left hatched because in this parameter range the friction is deemed indefinite, which Moody remarked could at least partially be due to the different initial conditions used to establish the flow. Here we investigate this issue and seek a systematic dependence for friction in the transitional regime. The novel method we use is to approach the transitional regime from above by reducing the flow speed from a turbulent flow state. We find that in different pipe flow setups, both driven by gravity, a single curve corresponding to a maximum density of the transitional flow structures is found. We test the generality of this result using an alternative method to drive the flow through the pipe, using a mass displacement device. Our investigation of the flow driven by a syringe produces yet a different curve, indicating that the method of driving the flow has a significant impact on both the final states and the paths to them in the transitional regime.</description>

      <title>Insights into the mechanics of pure and bacteria-laden sessile whole blood droplet evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mechanics of evaporation and precipitate formation in pure and bacteria-laden sessile blood droplets in the context of precipitate patterns as a disease diagnostics marker. Using optical diagnostics, theoretical analysis, and micro/nano-characterization techniques, we show that the transient evaporation process has three stages based on the evaporation rate. In the first stage, edge evaporation dominates, forming a gelated three-phase contact line. The radially outward capillary flow inside the evaporating droplet causes an accumulation of red blood cells, resulting in a sol-gel phase transition. The intermediate stage consists of the gelation front propagating radially inwards due to the combined effect of capillary flow and droplet height reduction evaporating in pinned mode, forming a wet gel phase. We unearthed that the gelation of the entire droplet occurs in the second stage, and the wet gel formed contains trace amounts of water that are detectable in our experiments. Further, we show that the precipitate thickness profile computed from the theoretical analysis conforms to the optical profilometry measurements. In the final slowest evaporation stage, the wet gel transforms into a dry gel, leading to desiccation-induced stress forming diverse crack patterns in the precipitate. We show that the drop evaporation rate and final dried residue pattern do not change appreciably within the parameter variation of the bacterial concentration typically found in bacterial infection of living organisms. However, at exceedingly high bacterial concentrations, the cracks formed in the coronal region deviate from the typical radial cracks found in lower concentrations.</description>

      <title>Particle chirality does not matter in the large-scale features of strong turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence in a cubic domain to investigate the dynamics of heavy, chiral, finite-size inertial particles and their effects on the flow. Using an immersed-boundary method and a complex collision model, four-way coupled simulations have been performed, and the effects of particle-to-fluid density ratio, turbulence strength and particle volume fraction have been analysed. We find that freely falling particles on the one hand add energy to the turbulent flow but, on the other hand, they also enhance the flow dissipation: depending on the combination of flow parameters, the former or the latter mechanism prevails, thus yielding enhanced or weakened turbulence. Furthermore, particle chirality entails a preferential angular velocity which induces a net vorticity in the fluid phase. As turbulence strengthens, the energy introduced by the falling particles becomes less relevant and stronger velocity fluctuations alter the solid phase dynamics, making the effect of chirality irrelevant for the large-scale features of the flow. Moreover, comparing the time history of collision events for chiral particles and spheres (at the same volume fraction) suggests that the former tend to entangle, in contrast to the latter which rebound impulsively.</description>

      <title>Deep reinforcement learning for the management of the wall regeneration cycle in wall-bounded turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wall cycle in wall-bounded turbulent flows is a complex turbulence regeneration mechanism that remains not fully understood. This study explores the potential of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for managing the wall regeneration cycle to achieve desired flow dynamics. We integrate the StableBaselines3 DRL libraries with the open-source DNS solver CaNS to create a robust platform for dynamic flow control. The DRL agent interacts with the DNS environment, learning policies that modify wall boundary conditions to optimize objectives such as the reduction of the skin-friction coefficient or the enhancement of certain coherent structures features.
  Initial experiments demonstrate the capability of DRL to achieve drag-reduction rates comparable with those achieved via traditional methods, though limited to short time periods. We also propose a strategy to enhance the coherence of velocity streaks, assuming that maintaining straight streaks can inhibit instability and further reduce skin friction. The implementation makes use of the message-passing-interface (MPI) wrappers for efficient communication between the Python-based DRL agent and the DNS solver, ensuring scalability on high-performance computing architectures.
  Our results highlight the promise of DRL in flow control applications and underscore the need for more advanced control laws and objective functions. Future work will focus on optimizing actuation periods and exploring new computational architectures to extend the applicability and the efficiency of DRL in turbulent flow management.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Closure Parametrizations with Metrics: Dispersive Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a data-driven framework for multi-scale parametrization of velocity-dependent dispersive transport in porous media. Pore-scale flow and transport simulations are conducted on periodic pore geometries, and volume-averaging is used to isolate dispersive transport, producing parameters for the dispersive closure term at the Representative Elementary Volume (REV) scale. After validation on unit cells with symmetric and asymmetric geometries, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to predict dispersivity directly from pore-geometry images. Descriptive metrics are also introduced to better understand the parameter space and are used to build a neural network that predicts dispersivity based solely on these metrics. While the models predict longitudinal dispersivity well, transversal dispersivity remains difficult to capture, likely requiring more advanced models to fully describe pore-scale transversal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric limit cycles within Lorenz chaos induce anomalous mobility for a memory-driven active particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On applying a small bias force, non-equilibrium systems may respond in paradoxical ways such as with giant negative mobility (GNM) -- a large net drift opposite to the applied bias, or giant positive mobility (GPM) -- an anomalously large drift in the same direction as the applied bias. Such behaviors have been extensively studied in idealized models of externally driven passive inertial particles. Here, we consider a minimal model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments with walking and superwalking droplets, whose equation of motion maps to the celebrated Lorenz system. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model for the active particle, we uncover a dynamical mechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space. Within the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting asymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force, resulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the active particle's memory. Our work highlights a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of anomalous transport behaviors for active particles described by low-dimensional nonlinear models.</description>
