      <title>Cycle-lengths of Multi-Dimensional $\sigma$ Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the game Lights Out is played according to an algorithm specifying the player's exact sequence of moves, it can be modeled using deterministic cellular automata. One such model reduces to the $\sigma$ automaton, which evolves according to the 2-dimensional analog of Rule 90. We consider how the cycle lengths of multi-dimensional $\sigma$ automata depend on their dimension. The main result of this work is that the cycle-lengths of 1-dimensional $\sigma$ automata and 2-dimensional $\sigma$ automata (of the same size) are equal, and we prove this by relating the eigenvalues and Jordan blocks of their respective transition matrices. We also find that cycle-lengths of higher-dimensional $\sigma$ automata are bounded (despite the number of lattice sites increasing with dimension) and eventually saturate the upper bound. On the way, we derive a general formula for the size of the largest Jordan block of the Kronecker sum of two matrices over $GF(2)$ using properties of Pascal's Triangle.</description>

      <title>Reachability in Trace-Pushdown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the reachability relation of pushdown systems whose pushdown holds a Mazurkiewicz trace instead of just a word as in classical systems. Under two natural conditions on the transition structure of such systems, we prove that the reachability relation is lc-rational, a new notion that restricts the class of rational trace relations. We also develop the theory of these lc-rational relations to the point where they allow to infer that forwards-reachability of a trace-pushdown system preserves the rationality and backwards-reachability the recognizability of sets of configurations. As a consequence, we obtain that it is decidable whether one recognizable set of configurations can be reached from some rational set of configurations. All our constructions are polynomial (assuming the dependence alphabet to be fixed).
  These findings generalize results by Caucal on classical pushdown systems (namely the rationality of the reachability relation of such systems) and complement results by Zetzsche (namely the decidability for arbitrary transition structures under severe restrictions on the dependence alphabet).</description>

      <title>Learning Automata with Name Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automata over infinite alphabets have emerged as a convenient computational model for processing structures involving data, such as nonces in cryptographic protocols or data values in XML documents. We introduce active learning methods for bar automata, a species of automata that process finite data words represented as bar strings, which are words with explicit name binding letters. Bar automata have pleasant algorithmic properties. We develop a framework in which every learning algorithm for standard deterministic or nondeterministic finite automata over finite alphabets can be used to learn bar automata, with a query complexity determined by that of the chosen learner. The technical key to our approach is the algorithmic handling of $\alpha$-equivalence of bar strings, which allows to bridge the gap between finite and infinite alphabets. The principles underlying our framework are generic and also apply to bar B\"uchi automata and bar tree automata, leading to the first active learning methods for data languages of infinite words and finite trees.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Complex Mathematical Statements with LLMs: A Study on Mathematical Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to their linguistic capabilities, LLMs offer an opportunity to bridge the gap between informal mathematics and formal languages through autoformalization. However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions -- a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalisation, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we guide LLMs through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Subshifts defined by nondeterministic and alternating plane-walking automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plane-walking automata were introduced by Salo &amp; T\"orma to recognise languages of two-dimensional infinite words (subshifts), the counterpart of $4$-way finite automata for two-dimensional finite words. We extend the model to allow for nondeterminism and alternation of quantifiers. We prove that the recognised subshifts form a strict subclass of sofic subshifts, and that the classes corresponding to existential and universal nondeterminism are incomparable and both larger that the deterministic class. We define a hierarchy of subshifts recognised by plane-walking automata with alternating quantifiers, which we conjecture to be strict.</description>

      <title>Avoiding abelian and additive powers in rich words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the avoidability of abelian and additive powers in infinite rich words. In particular, we construct an infinite additive $5$-power-free rich word over $\{0,1\}$ and an infinite additive $4$-power-free rich word over $\{0, 1, 2\}$. The alphabet sizes are as small as possible in both cases, even for abelian powers.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{FORM}$: Learning Expressive and Transferable First-Order Logic Reward Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) are an effective approach for addressing non-Markovian rewards in reinforcement learning (RL) through finite-state machines. Traditional RMs, which label edges with propositional logic formulae, inherit the limited expressivity of propositional logic. This limitation hinders the learnability and transferability of RMs since complex tasks will require numerous states and edges. To overcome these challenges, we propose First-Order Reward Machines ($\texttt{FORM}$s), which use first-order logic to label edges, resulting in more compact and transferable RMs. We introduce a novel method for $\textbf{learning}$ $\texttt{FORM}$s and a multi-agent formulation for $\textbf{exploiting}$ them and facilitate their transferability, where multiple agents collaboratively learn policies for a shared $\texttt{FORM}$. Our experimental results demonstrate the scalability of $\texttt{FORM}$s with respect to traditional RMs. Specifically, we show that $\texttt{FORM}$s can be effectively learnt for tasks where traditional RM learning approaches fail. We also show significant improvements in learning speed and task transferability thanks to the multi-agent learning framework and the abstraction provided by the first-order language.</description>
