      <title>A vertically integrated model with phase change for aquifers in cold firn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets contributes significantly to sea level rise, yet the dynamics governing its transport and retention in cold firn remain poorly constrained. We present a vertically integrated model that includes phase change during the migration of aquifers in cold firn and a constant residual trapping of liquid water. The model provides a unified framework connecting gravity-driven flows in temperate soils with those in cold firn, highlighting the analogous physics governing both systems. Analytical solutions are derived for constant volume aquifers and validated against numerical solutions that can be used to elucidate key features of meltwater dynamics and serve as benchmarks for firn hydrologic models. Finally, we demonstrate a three-dimensional expansion of an aquifer in cold, heterogeneous firn. The analytical and numerical solutions demonstrate that the dynamics of the laterally propagating aquifer slow at lower initial firn temperatures because of the enhanced reduction in porosity and the associated loss of liquid water. In summary, our framework offers insights into the formation and evolution of firn aquifers in percolation zones, which will help elucidate the role of modulating meltwater fluxes that affect surface mass loss and contribute to changes in global sea levels.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of the Flow in a Realistic Human Airway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulations of the flow in the human airway are essential for advancing diagnostic methods. Many existing computational studies rely on simplified geometries or turbulence models, limiting their simulation's ability to resolve flow features such shear-layer instabilities or secondary vortices. In this study, direct numerical simulations were performed for inspiratory flow through a detailed airway model which covers the nasal mask region to the 6th bronchial bifurcation. Simulations were conducted at two physiologically relevant \textsc{Reynolds} numbers with respect to the pharyngeal diameter, i.e., at Re_p=400 (resting) and Re_p=1200 (elevated breathing). These values characterize resting and moderately elevated breathing conditions. A lattice-Boltzmann method was employed to directly simulate the flow, i.e., no turbulence model was used. The flow field was examined across four anatomical regions: 1) the nasal cavity, 2) the naso- and oropharynx, 3) the laryngopharynx and larynx, and 4) the trachea and carinal bifurcation. The total pressure loss increased from 9.76 Pa at Re_p=400 to 41.93 Pa at Re_p=1200. The nasal cavity accounted for the majority of this loss for both Reynolds numbers, though its relative contribution decreased from 81.3% at Re_p=400 to 73.4% at Re_p=1200. At Re_p=1200, secondary vortices in the nasopharyngeal bend and turbulent shear-layers in the glottis jet enhanced the local pressure losses. In contrast, the carinal bifurcation mitigated upstream unsteadiness and stabilized the flow. A key outcome is the spatial correlation between the pressure loss and the onset of flow instabilities across the four regions. This yields a novel perspective on how the flow resistance and vortex dynamics vary with geometric changes and flow rate.</description>

      <title>Water wave reconstruction of full hydrodynamic models via data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strategy for reconstructing the water wave field using a data assimilation method is proposed in the present study. Special treatments are introduced to address the ensemble diversity and the discontinuous free surface with hydrodynamic constraints when implementing the EnKF approach. Additionally, the POD method is employed for dimensionality reduction, but from an ensemble point of view. The main purpose of this study is to achieve satisfactory consistency between the water waves computed by the numerical solver, particularly by the VOF method, and those observed in the laboratory wave flume within the test section of interest. To validate the proposed framework, three representative conditions are tested: regular waves, irregular waves, and plunging waves. The effects of observation noise, modal truncation, and other factors are also examined. From a practical perspective, this work provides a promising way to realize the coupling between experiments and numerical simulations, and establishes a prototype of a ``digital twin wave tank''.</description>

      <title>Thermocapillary migration of an odd viscous droplet on a uniformly heated surface: A lattice Boltzmann study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the thermocapillary actuation behavior of an odd viscous droplet on a uniformly heated surface is numerically investigated using a phase-field-based lattice Boltzmann method. The numerical results reveal that unlike a conventional viscous droplet that remains stationary on a uniformly heated surface, the presence of odd viscosity converts tangential Marangoni stresses into asymmetric normal stresses along the interface, thereby inducing spontaneous droplet motion. Specifically, when the odd viscosity coefficient is positive (negative), the droplet migrates toward the right (left). Additionally, due to the enhanced interfacial temperature gradient, the droplet migration velocity consistently increases with the contact angle. Further, it is observed that the droplet's migration velocity decreases with an increasing viscosity ratio between the surrounding fluid and the droplet. Finally, as the droplet is placed on an inclined surface, its migration direction and velocity are governed by the interaction between gravity and the odd viscosity-induced force, and in certain cases, the droplet can even climb upward against gravity.</description>

      <title>Wetted-Area Minimum and Inlet-Outlet Reciprocity in Optimal Manifolds of Rarefied Gas Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While flow optimization has been extensively studied in the continuum regime, its extension to rarefied gas flows remains less explored. Here, based on the Boltzmann model equation, an adjoint topology optimization method is employed to design two-dimensional single inlet multi outlet manifolds, aiming to maximize the total mass flow rate while maintaining outflow uniformity. Two key findings are revealed. (1) analogous to the Knudsen minimum in mass flow rate in the transition regime, a wetted-area minimum is identified, but in the slip flow regime. This phenomenon arises from the competition between flow bend loss and surface friction loss, with the latter being affected by velocity slip at the solid surface. (2) the inlet outlet reciprocity emerges in the free molecular flow regime, where the optimal design becomes invariant to inlet outlet orientation and pressure ratio. Additional insights are gained regarding the channel curvature, compressibility effects, and the constraint of outflow uniformity. These findings elucidate the mechanisms governing rarefied gas transport and offer design guidance for manifolds operating in vacuum environments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Forest Canopy Structure on Buoyant Plume Dynamics During Wildland Fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of forest canopy heterogeneity on buoyant plume dynamics resulting from surface thermal anomalies representing wildland fires, utilizing Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The Parallelized Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) was employed to simulate six canopy configurations: no canopy, homogeneous canopy, external plume-edge canopy, internal plume-edge canopy, 100 m gap canopy, and 200 m gap canopy. Each configuration was analyzed with and without a static surface heat flux patch of 5000 $\mathrm{W \cdot m^{-2}}$, resulting in a resting buoyant plume. Simulations were conducted under three crosswind speeds: 0, 5, and 10 $\mathrm{m \cdot s^{-1}}$. Results show that canopy structure significantly modifies plume behavior, mean flow, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets. Plume updraft speed and tilt varied with canopy configuration and crosswind speed. Pressure gradients associated with plume updrafts were modified based on the canopy configuration, resulting in varying crosswind speed reductions at the plume region. Strong momentum absorption was observed above the canopy for the crosswind cases, with the greatest enhancement in the gap canopies. Momentum injection from below the canopy due to the heat source was also observed, resulting in plume structure modulation based on canopy configuration. TKE was found to be the largest in the gap canopy configurations. TKE budget analysis revealed that buoyant production dominated over shear production. At the center of the heat patch, the gap canopy configurations showed enhanced buoyancy within the gap. Spatial distributions demonstrated increased shear production at the interface between the plume and crosswind.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive elastic flaps with bending and torsion for 3D blunt body drag reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential for drag-reduction of low-mechanical-order, self-adaptive control systems, consisting of hinged flaps attached along the edges of the rectangular base of a canonical blunt body. Comparative experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel under crosswind conditions at a Reynolds number of $Re = 2.13 \times 10^5$. The flaps, made of rigid rectangular panels, are mounted in three configurations: rigidly fixed%(RF) , flexibly hinged with a single degree of freedom in bending, and flexibly hinged with two degrees of freedom, allowing both bending and torsion, the latter representing a novel drag-reduction device, easily tunable to ensure a quasi-steady, stable adaptive reconfiguration. Two geometric arrangements are tested: horizontal flaps attached along the top and bottom (TB) edges, and vertical flaps along the lateral (left and right, LR) edges. The experimental study includes force, pressure, flap deformation and wake velocity measurements at varying yaw angles to simulate crosswind conditions. When the body is aligned with the flow, both arrangements reduce drag due to a rear cavity effect that elongates the recirculating flow. The TB arrangement is found to be much more effective at reducing drag in yawed conditions and its performance is improved using the flexible hinges. In these cases, static deformations correspond to boat-tailing that reduces the induced drag together with the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake. The use of the wind-average drag coefficient (taking into account events of crosswind) to evaluate an effective drag reduction clearly shows the TB arrangement with bending and torsion as the best appendage, with a 7.62\% drag reduction compared to the body with no appendages, proving the good performance of simple, two-degrees-of-freedom control systems to adapt to changing three-dimensional wakes.</description>

      <title>Analysis and prediction of noise from installed subsonic chevron jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An experiment is conducted to investigate the effects of chevrons on installed subsonic jet noise at a Mach number of 0.5 using the NASA SMC000 (round) and SMC006 (chevron) nozzles. The jets are of a diameter D=16.93 mm and placed near a flat plate, with a horizontal separation distance L=6.5D between the plate's trailing edge and the nozzle exit. The vertical separation distance H varies between 1.5D, 2D, 2.5D and 3D. Far-field sound is measured at various observable angles ranging from $\theta=60^\circ$ to $150^\circ$ to the downstream jet axis on the reflected side. The measured sound spectra are compared to the near-field scattering model developed by Lyu et al, together with the isolated near-field pressure spectra inputs from corresponding large eddy simulations for both nozzles. Results show that jet installation results in a strong noise amplification at low frequencies for both nozzles due to the scattering of the near-field pressure fluctuations and a mild noise increase at high frequencies due to surface reflection (reflected side). The low-frequency amplification is strongest at H=1.5D and has a dipolar directivity. A secondary spectral hump appears within this low-frequency amplification hump, which is hypothesised due to the interference between the sound generated by the large coherent structures directly and that by their scattering at the plate's trailing-edge. The use of chevrons reduces the low-frequency noise for isolated jets, but leads to even stronger noise amplification for installed jets; this is likely due to enhanced jet mixing resulting in stronger near-field pressure fluctuations at a fixed radial distance. Results show that the scattering model can predict the low-frequency noise amplification well at various observer angles for both nozzles, suggesting the validity of the instability-wave scattering mechanism and modelling for both round and chevron jets.</description>

      <title>Stability of trapped fluid clusters in two-phase porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in multiphase flow through porous media is to understand and predict the conditions under which trapped fluid clusters become mobilized. Here, we investigate the stability of such clusters in two-phase flow and present a simple, quasistatic model that accurately determines the critical Bond number (that is, the critical ratio between the average pressure gradient of the flow and the surface tension) for the onset of cluster mobilization. The model is derived by combining elementary geometrical considerations with mass conservation and a mechanical equilibrium condition, resulting in a system of coupled differential equations. Our derivation sheds new light on the mechanisms that govern cluster stability. In addition, since the number of equations equals the number of cluster openings, our model is significantly faster than direct numerical simulations of the same problem and enables efficient exploration of the system's parameter space. Using this approach, we highlight a discrepancy with the prediction of current mean-field theories, which predict that the largest stable cluster size scales in proportion to $r/\text{Bo}^\alpha$, where $r$ is a typical pore size, $\text{Bo}$ is the Bond number and $\alpha$ is a fixed exponent. We discuss the mechanisms that explain the breakdown of the mean field theories, and we show that a scaling law of this form can only exist if $\alpha$ is allowed to depend on a broad set of flow and geometric parameters.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann model for non-ideal compressible fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice Boltzmann formulation for the simulation of compressible, non-ideal fluid flows. The method employs first-neighbor lattices and introduces a consistent set of correction terms through quasi-equilibrium attractors, ensuring positive-definite and Galilean-invariant Navier-Stokes dissipation rates. This construction circumvents the need for extended stencils or ad hoc regularization, while maintaining numerical stability and thermodynamic consistency across a broad range of flow regimes. The resulting model accurately reproduces both Euler- and Navier-Stokes-level hydrodynamics. As a stringent validation, we demonstrate, for the first time within a lattice Boltzmann framework, quantitatively accurate simulations of drop-shock interactions at Mach numbers up to 1.47. The proposed approach thus extends the applicability of lattice Boltzmann methods to high-speed, non-ideal compressible flows with a minimal kinetic stencil.</description>

      <title>Conversion and Damping of Non-axisymmetric Internal Gravity Waves in Magnetized Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetism is thought to play an important role in the evolution and dynamics of stars, though little is known about magnetic fields deep within stellar interiors. A promising avenue for probing these fields uses asteroseismic observations of global oscillations that result from the coupling of acoustic waves in the convective zone to internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the radiative interior. Recent modeling efforts implicate deep magnetic fields in the suppression of dipole mixed modes observed in 20% of red giants and a number of high-mass main sequence stars. Previous numerical and theoretical work shows that core magnetic fields could suppress axisymmetric global modes by refracting down-going IGWs into slow-magnetosonic (SM) waves that damp at magnetic cutoff heights. Here, we extend these results to the non-axisymmetric case, for which the IGWs and SM waves are coupled to a continuous spectrum of Alfven waves (AWs). We consider a Cartesian model of the radiative interior with uniform stratification and a spatially-varying, current-free magnetic field. Using a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to solve for the vertical mode structure, corroborated with numerical simulations, we show that IGWs convert to up-going SM waves, which resonate with the Alfven spectrum and produce mixed SM-AW modes. We find cutoff heights (as in the axisymmetric case), above which the SM/SM-AWs convert to AWs. Latitudinal variations of the background magnetic field lead to phase mixing of the AWs, resulting in rapid damping. Our results suggest that energy in both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric IGWs is lost via interactions with a strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue wave statistics for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves (RWs) emerging from the modulation instability (MI) of plane waves for the DNLS equation. The \(n\)-th moments and ensemble-averaged kinetic and potential energy exhibit oscillatory convergence towards their steady-state values. Specifically, the amplitudes of oscillations for these indexes decay asymptotically with time as \(t^{-1.36}\), while the phase shifts demonstrate a nonlinear decay with a rate of \(t^{-0.78}\). The frequency of these oscillations is observed to be twice the maximum growth rate of MI. These oscillations can be classified into two distinct types: one is in phase with ensemble-averaged potential energy modulus $|\langle H_4\rangle|$, and the other is anti-phase. At the same time, this unity is also reflected in the wave-action spectrum \( S_k(t) \) for a given \( k \), the auto-correlation function \( g(x,t) \) for a given \( x \), as well as the PDF \( P(I,t) \). The critical feature of the turbulence is the wave-action spectrum, which follows a power-law distribution of \( |k+3|^{-\alpha} \) expect for $k=-3$. Unlike the NLS equation, the turbulence in the DNLS setting is asymmetric, primarily due to the asymmetry between the wave number of the plane wave from the MI and the perturbation wave number.. As the asymptotic peak value of \( S_k \) is observed at \( k = -3 \), the auto-correlation function exhibits a nonzero level as \( x \to \pm L/2 \). The PDF of the wave intensity asymptotically approaches the exponential distribution in an oscillatory manner. However, during the initial stage of the nonlinear phase, MI slightly increases the occurrence of RWs. This happens at the moments when the potential modulus is at its minimum, where the probability of RWs occurring in the range of \( I\in [12, 15] \) is significantly higher than in the asymptotic steady state.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Free Dynamics in Rotating Spherical Shell Convection Driven By Internal Heating and Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk properties of convection in stellar and giant planet interiors are often assumed to be independent of the molecular diffusivities, which are very small. By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating, spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest diffusion-free dynamics can be obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this set-up unambiguously yields diffusion-free behaviour for bulk 'thermal' properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion-free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk 'kinematic' properties is regime-dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities, and the strength and structure of the zonal flow, are diffusion-dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are uninfluenced by rotation, or are only influenced by rotation at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flow amplitudes are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealised simulations are diffusion-free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description>

Abstract: We study the predictability of turbulent velocity signals using probabilistic analog-forecasting. Here, predictability is defined by the accuracy of forecasts and the associated uncertainties. We study the Gledzer--Ohkitani--Yamada (GOY) shell model of turbulence as well as experimental measurements from a fully developed turbulent flow. In both cases, we identify the extreme values of velocity at small scales as localized unpredictable events that lead to a loss of predictability: worse mean predictions and increase of their uncertainties. The GOY model, with its explicit scale separation, allows to evaluate the prediction performance at individual scales, and so to better relate the intensity of extreme events and the loss of forecast performance. Results show that predictability decreases systematically from large to small scales. These findings establish a statistical connection between predictability loss across scales and intermittency in turbulent flows.</description>
