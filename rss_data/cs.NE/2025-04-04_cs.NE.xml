      <title>LLM-Guided Evolution: An Autonomous Model Optimization for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) requires domain knowledge of model design and a large amount of trial-and-error to achieve promising performance. Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have traditionally relied on fixed rules and pre-defined building blocks. The Large Language Model (LLM)-Guided Evolution (GE) framework transformed this approach by incorporating LLMs to directly modify model source code for image classification algorithms on CIFAR data and intelligently guide mutations and crossovers. A key element of LLM-GE is the "Evolution of Thought" (EoT) technique, which establishes feedback loops, allowing LLMs to refine their decisions iteratively based on how previous operations performed. In this study, we perform NAS for object detection by improving LLM-GE to modify the architecture of You Only Look Once (YOLO) models to enhance performance on the KITTI dataset. Our approach intelligently adjusts the design and settings of YOLO to find the optimal algorithms against objective such as detection accuracy and speed. We show that LLM-GE produced variants with significant performance improvements, such as an increase in Mean Average Precision from 92.5% to 94.5%. This result highlights the flexibility and effectiveness of LLM-GE on real-world challenges, offering a novel paradigm for automated machine learning that combines LLM-driven reasoning with evolutionary strategies.</description>

      <title>Learning and Improving Backgammon Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach to learning is presented, combining features of on-line and off-line methods to achieve considerable performance in the task of learning a backgammon value function in a process that exploits the processing power of parallel supercomputers. The off-line methods comprise a set of techniques for parallelizing neural network training and $TD(\lambda)$ reinforcement learning; here Monte-Carlo ``Rollouts'' are introduced as a massively parallel on-line policy improvement technique which applies resources to the decision points encountered during the search of the game tree to further augment the learned value function estimate. A level of play roughly as good as, or possibly better than, the current champion human and computer backgammon players has been achieved in a short period of learning.</description>

      <title>SymDQN: Symbolic Knowledge and Reasoning in Neural Network-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent. The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Green AI-Native Networks: Evaluation of Neural Circuit Policy for Estimating Energy Consumption of Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization of radio hardware and AI-based network management software yield significant energy savings in radio access networks. The execution of underlying Machine Learning (ML) models, which enable energy savings through recommended actions, may require additional compute and energy, highlighting the opportunity to explore and adopt accurate and energy-efficient ML technologies. This work evaluates the novel use of sparsely structured Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) in a use case to estimate the energy consumption of base stations. Sparsity in ML models yields reduced memory, computation and energy demand, hence facilitating a low-cost and scalable solution. We also evaluate the generalization capability of NCPs in comparison to traditional and widely used ML models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), via quantifying their sensitivity to varying model hyper-parameters (HPs). NCPs demonstrated a clear reduction in computational overhead and energy consumption. Moreover, results indicated that the NCPs are robust to varying HPs such as number of epochs and neurons in each layer, making them a suitable option to ease model management and to reduce energy consumption in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) in telecommunications.</description>

      <title>Evolving Generalizable Parallel Algorithm Portfolios via Domain-Agnostic Instance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization is the core objective when training optimizers from data. However, limited training instances often constrain the generalization capability of the trained optimizers. Co-evolutionary approaches address this challenge by simultaneously evolving a parallel algorithm portfolio (PAP) and an instance population to eventually obtain PAPs with good generalization. Yet, when applied to a specific problem class, these approaches have a major limitation. They require practitioners to provide instance generators specially tailored to the problem class, which is often non-trivial to design. This work proposes a general-purpose, off-the-shelf PAP construction approach, named domain-agnostic co-evolution of parameterized search (DACE), for binary optimization problems where decision variables take values of 0 or 1. The key novelty of DACE lies in its neural network-based domain-agnostic instance representation and generation mechanism that eliminates the need for domain-specific instance generators. The strong generality of DACE is validated across three real-world binary optimization problems: the complementary influence maximization problem (CIMP), the compiler arguments optimization problem (CAOP), and the contamination control problem (CCP). Given only a small set of training instances from these problem classes, DACE, without requiring domain knowledge, constructs PAPs with even better generalization performance than existing approaches on all three classes, despite their use of domain-specific instance generators.</description>
