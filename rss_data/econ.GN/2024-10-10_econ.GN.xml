      <title>Design Information Disclosure under Bidder Heterogeneity in Online Advertising Auctions: Implications of Bid-Adherence Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bidding is a key element of search advertising, but the variation in bidders' valuations and strategies is often overlooked. Disclosing bid information helps uncover this heterogeneity and enables platforms to tailor their disclosure policies to meet objectives like increasing consumer surplus or platform revenue. We analyzed data from a platform that provided bid recommendations based on historical bids. Our findings reveal that advertisers vary significantly in their strategies: some follow the platform's recommendations, while others create their own bids, deviating from the provided information. This highlights the need for customized information disclosure policies in online ad marketplaces. We developed an equilibrium model for Generalized Second Price (GSP) auctions, showing that adhering to bid recommendations with positive probability is suboptimal. We categorized advertisers as bid-adhering or bid-constructing and developed a structural model for self-bidding to identify private valuations. This model allowed for a counterfactual analysis of the impact of different levels of information disclosure. Both theoretical and empirical results suggest that moderate increases in disclosure improve platform revenue and market efficiency. Understanding bidder diversity is crucial for platforms, which can design more effective disclosure policies to address varying bidder needs and achieve their goals through costless information sharing.</description>

      <title>Free Public Transport: More Jobs without Environmental Damage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of a free-fare transport policy implemented by Brazilian localities on employment and greenhouse gas emissions. Using a staggered difference-in-differences approach, we find that fare-free transit increases employment by 3.2% and reduces emissions by 4.1%, indicating that transport policies can decouple economic activity from environmental damage. Our results are driven by workers transitioning from higher-emission to lower-emission sectors instead of being driven by a decline in private transportation use. Cost-benefit analyses suggest that the costly policy only presents net benefits after considering the tax inflows of the increased economic activity and the benefits of reduced carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Gender politics, environmental behaviours, and local territories: Evidence from Italian municipalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of female politicians on waste collection in Italian municipalities in different territories observed over the years 2010-2019. We used a staggered difference-in-differences design to obtain a causal interpretation of the estimated effects. We find that the majority of women in the municipal council positively influence pro-environmental individual behaviour. The impact of a female-majority council is heterogeneous by region and more pronounced in areas with lower social capital. Female politicians as catalysts for positive change fade after 5-6 years, likely due to persistent social norms locally, thus stressing the need for additional cultural actions with long-lasting effects.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Health Economics: Transforming the Landscape of Economic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolving role of health economics within economic research and publishing over the past 30 years. Historically largely a niche field, health economics has become increasingly prominent, with the share of health economics papers in top journals growing significantly. We aim to identify the factors behind this rise, examining how health economics contributes to the broader economic knowledge base and the roles distinct subfields play. Using a combination of bibliometric methods and natural language processing, we classify abstracts to define health economics. Our findings suggest that the mainstreaming of health economics is driven by innovative, high-quality research, with notable cyclicality in quality ratings that highlights the emergence and impact of distinct subfields within the discipline.</description>

      <title>Reproducing and Extending Experiments in Behavioral Strategy with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose LLM agents as a novel approach in behavioral strategy research, complementing simulations and laboratory experiments to advance our understanding of cognitive processes in decision-making. Specifically, we reproduce a human laboratory experiment in behavioral strategy using large language model (LLM) generated agents and investigate how LLM agents compare to observed human behavior. Our results show that LLM agents effectively reproduce search behavior and decision-making comparable to humans. Extending our experiment, we analyze LLM agents' simulated "thoughts," discovering that more forward-looking thoughts correlate with favoring exploitation over exploration to maximize wealth. We show how this new approach can be leveraged in behavioral strategy research and address limitations.</description>

      <title>Industrial complexity and the evolution of formal employment in developing cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What drives formal employment creation in developing cities? We find that larger cities, home to an abundant set of complex industries, employ a larger share of their working age population in formal jobs. We propose a hypothesis to explain this pattern, arguing that it is the organised nature of formal firms, whereby workers with complementary skills are coordinated in teams, that enables larger cities to create more formal employment. From this perspective, the growth of formal employment is dependent on the ability of a city to build on existing skills to enter new complex industries. To test our hypothesis, we construct a variable which captures the skill-proximity of cities' current industrial base to new complex industries, termed 'complexity potential'. Our main result is that complexity potential is robustly associated with subsequent growth of the formal employment rate in Colombian cities.</description>

      <title>Child labour and schooling decision of the marginal farmer households: An empirical evidence from the East Medinipur district of West Bengal, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the field investigation of West Bengal, this paper investigates whether the school-aged children of the marginal farmer households are full-time paid labourers or unpaid domestic labourers along with schooling or regular students. Probit Regression analysis is applied here to assess the influencing factors for reducing the size of the child labour force in practice. The result shows that the higher is the earning of the adult members of the households, the lower is the incidence of child labour. Moreover, the credit accessibility of the mother from the Self-help group and more person-days of the father in work in a reference year are also responsible for reducing the possibility of a child turning into labour. The study further suggests that the younger age of the father, education of fathers, and low operational landholdings are positive and significant determinants to decide on a child education by restricting their excessive domestic work burden.</description>

      <title>Inequality in Educational Attainment: Urban-Rural Comparison in the Indian Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16238v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article tries to compare urban and rural literacy of fifteen selected Indian states during 1981 - 2011 and explores the instruments which can reduce the disparity in urban and rural educational attainment. The study constructs the Sopher urban-rural differential literacy index to analyze the trends of literacy disparity across fifteen states in India over time. Although literacy disparity has decreased over time, Sopher index shows that the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra and even Karnataka faced high inequality in education between urban and rural India in 2011. Additionally, the Fixed Effect panel data regression technique has been applied in the study to identify the factors which influence urban-rural inequality in education. The model shows that the following factors can reduce literacy disparity between urban and rural areas of India: low fertility rate in rural women, higher percentages of rural females marrying after the age of 21 years, educational attainment of mothers and their labour force participation rate in rural areas.</description>

      <title>Global analysis reveals persistent shortfalls and regional differences in availability of foods needed for health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most people around the world still lack access to sufficient quantities of all food groups needed for an active and healthy life. This study traces historical and projected changes in global food systems toward alignment with the new Healthy Diet Basket (HDB) used by UN agencies and the World Bank to monitor the cost and affordability of healthy diets worldwide. Using the HDB as a standard to measure adequacy of national, regional and global supply-demand balances, we find substantial but inconsistent progress toward closer alignment with dietary guidelines, with large global shortfalls in fruits, vegetables, and legumes, nuts, and seeds, and large disparities among regions in use of animal source foods. Projections show that additional investments aimed at reducing chronic hunger would modestly accelerate improvements in adequacy where shortfalls are greatest, revealing the need for complementary investments to increase access to under-consumed food groups especially in low-income countries.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs and Comparison Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of how tradeoffs govern comparison complexity, and how this complexity generates systematic mistakes in choice. In our model, options are easier to compare when they involve less pronounced tradeoffs, in particular when they are 1) more similar feature-by-feature and 2) closer to dominance. These two postulates yield tractable measures of comparison complexity in the domains of multiattribute, lottery, and intertemporal choice. We show how our model organizes a range of behavioral regularities in choice and valuation, such as context effects, preference reversals, and apparent probability weighting and hyperbolic discounting. We test our model experimentally by varying the strength and nature of tradeoffs. First, we show that our complexity measures predict choice errors, choice inconsistency, and cognitive uncertainty in binary choice data across all three domains. Second, we document that manipulations of comparison complexity can reverse classic behavioral regularities, in line with the predictions of the theory. We apply our theory to study strategic obfuscation by firms in a pricing game.</description>

      <title>The Unelected Hand? Bureaucratic Influence and Electoral Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What role do non-elected bureaucrats play when elections provide imperfect accountability and create incentives for pandering? We develop a model where politicians and bureaucrats interact to implement policy. Both can either be good, sharing the voters' preferences over policies, or bad, intent on enacting policies that favor special interests. Our analysis identifies the conditions under which good bureaucrats choose to support or oppose political pandering. When bureaucrats wield significant influence over policy decisions, good politicians lose their incentives to pander, a shift that ultimately benefits voters. An intermediate level of bureaucratic influence over policymaking can be voter-optimal: large enough to prevent pandering but small enough to avoid granting excessive influence to potentially bad bureaucrats.</description>

      <title>The Uneven Access to COVID-19 Research for Women in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gender disparities in medical and academic careers. In this study, we examine the impact of COVID-19 as a new research topic on the presence of women in key authorship positions in biomedical research. We determine author's gender based on the names listed on their scientific publications and analyze the changes in the composition of the scientific teams after the COVID-19 outbreak. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach, we find that although the share of female authorships has increased overall, women are less likely to be first or last authors (the most prestigious positions) on COVID-19-related research papers and more likely to be found in middle author positions. Stay-at-home mandates, the journal importance and funding opportunities do not fully account for the decline of women in key author positions. The main difference in first authorship is due to the composition of the team and the experience of the lead authors in COVID-19 related research. First authorship by women declined after teams of novices emerged, where lead authors have no prior experience in COVID-related research. Discretionality in first-author appointments for newcomers, combined with high pressure to publish quickly, may have led to discriminatory biases. Conversely, there may also be differences in risk-taking attitudes in doing research in unfamiliar domains. Monitoring gender inequality in scientific production is crucial for reducing gender inequalities and for implementing timely policies that ensure equal access to emerging research topics.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, and low-pollution firms. Mechanism analysis shows that green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Overcome the Machine Penalty When Acting Fairly but Not When Acting Selfishly or Altruistically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In social dilemmas where the collective and self-interests are at odds, people typically cooperate less with machines than with fellow humans, a phenomenon termed the machine penalty. Overcoming this penalty is critical for successful human-machine collectives, yet current solutions often involve ethically-questionable tactics, like concealing machines' non-human nature. In this study, with 1,152 participants, we explore the possibility of closing this research question by using Large Language Models (LLMs), in scenarios where communication is possible between interacting parties. We design three types of LLMs: (i) Cooperative, aiming to assist its human associate; (ii) Selfish, focusing solely on maximizing its self-interest; and (iii) Fair, balancing its own and collective interest, while slightly prioritizing self-interest. Our findings reveal that, when interacting with humans, fair LLMs are able to induce cooperation levels comparable to those observed in human-human interactions, even when their non-human nature is fully disclosed. In contrast, selfish and cooperative LLMs fail to achieve this goal. Post-experiment analysis shows that all three types of LLMs succeed in forming mutual cooperation agreements with humans, yet only fair LLMs, which occasionally break their promises, are capable of instilling a perception among humans that cooperating with them is the social norm, and eliciting positive views on their trustworthiness, mindfulness, intelligence, and communication quality. Our findings suggest that for effective human-machine cooperation, bot manufacturers should avoid designing machines with mere rational decision-making or a sole focus on assisting humans. Instead, they should design machines capable of judiciously balancing their own interest and the interest of humans.</description>
