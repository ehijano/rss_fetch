      <title>Mechanisms and Scale-up Potential of 3D Solar Interfacial-Evaporators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaporation rates from porous evaporators under sunlight have been reported to exceed the solar-thermal limit, determined by relating the incoming solar energy to the latent and sensible heat of water, for applications in desalination and brine pond drying. Although flat two-dimensional (2D) evaporators exceeding the solar limit implies a non-thermal process, tall three-dimensional (3D) solar evaporators can exceed it by absorbing additional environmental heat into its cold sidewalls. Through modeling, we explain the physics and identify the critical heights in which a fin transitions from 2D to 3D evaporation and exceeds the solar-thermal limit. Our analyses illustrate that environmental heat absorption in 3D evaporators is determined by the ambient relative humidity and the airflow velocity. The model is then coarse-grained into a large-scale fin array device on the meters scale to analyze their scalability. We identify that these devices are unlikely to scale favorably in closed environment settings such as solar stills. Our modeling clearly illustrates the benefits and limitations of 3D evaporating arrays and pinpoints design choices in previous works that hinder the device's overall performance. This work illustrates the importance in distinguishing 2D from 3D evaporation for mechanisms underlying interfacial evaporation exceeding the solar-thermal limit.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Inverse Design for Nanowire Single-Photon Avalanche Detectors via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) have enabled various applications in emerging photonic quantum information technologies in recent years. However, despite many efforts to improve SPAD's performance, the design of SPADs remained largely an iterative and time-consuming process where a designer makes educated guesses of a device structure based on empirical reasoning and solves the semiconductor drift-diffusion model for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., directly inferring a structure needed to achieve desired performance, which is of ultimate interest to designers, remains an unsolved problem. We propose a novel physics-aware inverse design workflow for SPADs using a deep learning model and demonstrate it with an example of finding the key parameters of semiconductor nanowires constituting the unit cell of an SPAD, given target photon detection efficiency. Our inverse design workflow is not restricted to the case demonstrated and can be applied to design conventional planar structure-based SPADs, photodetectors, and solar cells.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Theoretical Study of Thin-covered Composite Dowels considering Multiple Load Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread application of composite structures in the fields of building and bridge constructions, thin-covered composite dowels are increasingly adopted in various engineering scenarios. This paper presents a design methodology for thin-covered composite dowels, supported by both experimental and theoretical investigations. In the experiment, a novel test rig and specimens are designed to facilitate tensile-shear coupling loading. The study identifies a new failure mode: Restricted Cone Failure (RCF) in thin-covered composite dowels under tensile-shear coupling load, which distinct from conventional composite dowels. This RCF mode is attributed to the thin thickness of the side concrete cover, which restricts the development of the failure cone in the thickness direction. Additionally, a parametric analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of key factors--such as steel dowel thickness, effective embedment depth, and the tensile strength of steel fiber reinforced concrete--on the bearing capacity and ductility of thin-covered composite dowels. Based on the theoretical findings, comprehensive tensile, shear, and tensile-shear coupling capacity models along with an engineering design model are developed to aid in the practical application of thin-covered composite dowels.</description>

      <title>Blending Optimal Control and Biologically Plausible Learning for Noise-Robust Physical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational demands for artificial intelligence (AI) have spurred the exploration of computing principles beyond conventional digital computers. Physical neural networks (PNNs) offer efficient neuromorphic information processing by harnessing the innate computational power of physical processes; however, training their weight parameters is computationally expensive. We propose a training approach for substantially reducing this training cost. Our training approach merges an optimal control method for continuous-time dynamical systems with a biologically plausible training method--direct feedback alignment. In addition to the reduction of training time, this approach achieves robust processing even under measurement errors and noise without requiring detailed system information. The effectiveness was numerically and experimentally verified in an optoelectronic delay system. Our approach significantly extends the range of physical systems practically usable as PNNs.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial high-K AlBN barrier GaN HEMTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a polarization-induced 2D electron gas (2DEG) at an epitaxial AlBN/GaN heterojunction grown on a SiC substrate. Using this 2DEG in a long conducting channel, we realize ultra-thin barrier AlBN/GaN high electron mobility transistors that exhibit current densities of more than 0.25 A/mm, clean current saturation, a low pinch-off voltage of -0.43 V, and a peak transconductance of 0.14 S/mm. Transistor performance in this preliminary realization is limited by the contact resistance. Capacitance-voltage measurements reveal that introducing 7 % B in the epitaxial AlBN barrier on GaN boosts the relative dielectric constant of AlBN to 16, higher than the AlN dielectric constant of 9. Epitaxial high-K barrier AlBN/GaN HEMTs can thus extend performance beyond the capabilities of current GaN transistors.</description>

      <title>Node-to-node contact-friction problems using run-time parameter updates on a conventional force-deformation finite element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel implementation of the traditional node-to-node Coulomb contact-friction problem is presented that utilizes run-time parameter updates on conventional elasto-plastic elements. The two-noded elements are defined by an independent uniaxial force-deformation (or constitutive) relation in each degree of freedom. The location of the two nodes may or may not be coincident. A parameter is a pointer to a value (nodal geometry, element property, material property, etc.) in the finite element domain that can be controlled by the user. Parameters that control the frictional interface normal and tangential responses are updated based on contact detection, and eliminate the need for adding new source code to the finite element library of a given software. The run-time algorithm for updating both an elastic and elasto-plastic force-deformation element to achieve a penalty-based contact-friction model is presented. Static and dynamic cases were investigated for a two-noded unit process and compared with the results obtained from closed-form solutions. Multiple interface elements were then used for the sliding, tipping, and rocking responses of a rigid block on rigid foundation. Finally, several case studies were investigated, and the findings were compared with the experimental results or solutions from the literature. The proposed friction-contact implementation can be deployed in larger finite element models, and parameter updates facilitate implementation of a wider array of friction models by changing only the constitutive model.</description>

      <title>Rewards-based image analysis in microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing imaging and hyperspectral data is crucial across scientific fields, including biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The primary goal is to transform high-resolution or high-dimensional data into an interpretable format to generate actionable insights, aiding decision-making and advancing knowledge. Currently, this task relies on complex, human-designed workflows comprising iterative steps such as denoising, spatial sampling, keypoint detection, feature generation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolutions. The introduction of machine learning over the past decade has accelerated tasks like image segmentation and object detection via supervised learning, and dimensionality reduction via unsupervised methods. However, both classical and NN-based approaches still require human input, whether for hyperparameter tuning, data labeling, or both. The growing use of automated imaging tools, from atomically resolved imaging to biological applications, demands unsupervised methods that optimize data representation for human decision-making or autonomous experimentation. Here, we discuss advances in reward-based workflows, which adopt expert decision-making principles and demonstrate strong transfer learning across diverse tasks. We represent image analysis as a decision-making process over possible operations and identify desiderata and their mappings to classical decision-making frameworks. Reward-driven workflows enable a shift from supervised, black-box models sensitive to distribution shifts to explainable, unsupervised, and robust optimization in image analysis. They can function as wrappers over classical and DCNN-based methods, making them applicable to both unsupervised and supervised workflows (e.g., classification, regression for structure-property mapping) across imaging and hyperspectral data.</description>

      <title>Optimal neutralization of negative space charges in photon-enhanced thermionic emission devices under bidirectional discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we innovatively modeled photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices, incorporating positive ion injection and bidirectional discharge's effects on the space charge barrier simultaneously. Compared to previous models, our model allows the positive ion distribution function to be compatible with scenarios in which the anode motive is either higher or lower than the cathode motive, and also adapts to significant anode discharge. Through numerical simulations and parametric analyses, we found that: (1) As the ratio of the positive ion increases, the capability for space charge neutralization becomes stronger. (2) The lower the electron affinity is, the smaller the ratio of positive ions are required. (3) When the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is lower, the impact of reverse discharge on the net current density is more pronounced. Conversely, when the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is greater, the ratio of positive ions required to achieve complete space charge neutralization increases. This study further elucidates the mechanisms and characteristics of space charge neutralization effects in PETE devices, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing their design. Additionally, the accompanying theory and algorithm possess the potential to spark innovative research across diverse fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials serve as versatile platforms for demonstrating condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium phenomena, with electrical circuits emerging as a particularly compelling medium. This review highlights recent advances in the experimental circuit realizations of topological, non-Hermitian, non-linear, Floquet and other notable phenomena. Initially performed mostly with passive electrical components, topolectrical circuits have evolved to incorporate active elements such as operational amplifiers and analog multipliers that combine to form negative impedance converters, complex phase elements, high-frequency temporal modulators and self-feedback mechanisms. This review provides a summary of these contemporary studies and discusses the broader potential of electrical circuits in physics.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling of Nanomechanical Vibrations to Individual Two-Level Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale defects behaving as two-level systems (TLSs) are crucial to the physics of modern quantum devices. Here, we study interactions between individual TLS defects and the mechanical vibrations of a nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) resonator. By applying a mechanical strain, we tune individual TLS onto resonance with the NEMS and observe strong coupling. By adjusting phonon number, we reveal the nonlinear energy levels of the hybridized system and confirm single-phonon nonlinearity. We also observe fluctuations between hybridized and bare resonance states as the TLS fluctuates between on- and off-resonance. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from intrinsic material properties, without requiring external electromagnetic systems or complex quantum circuits. Our work establishes a platform for exploring and manipulating TLS-phonon interactions in the single-phonon regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Engineering MoS2-MoTe2 Heterojunctions: Enhancing Piezoresponse and Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piezoelectric materials play a vital role in energy harvesting, piezotronics and various self-powered sensing applications. The piezoelectric strength of 2D materials is limited by the carrier charge screening, leading to reduced open circuit voltages and poor piezotronic performances. Reducing the carrier screening in devices is a key requirement to fully utilize the potential of 2D materials for piezoelectric applications. In this work, we demonstrate that lateral heterojunction devices offer an excellent way to improve the piezoelectric open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. Because of the asymmetric contacts with Nickel (Ni) electrodes, the heterojunctions of monolayer(1L) MoS_2 and MoTe_2 form a hybrid Schottky/p-n diode. We demonstrate a rectification ratio of more than 5000 without electrostatic gating. We observed that devices with higher junction potentials exhibit piezoelectric open-circuit voltages exceeding 1V and a peak power density of 690 mW/m^2. The output characteristics reveal a trade-off between open circuit voltages and rectification ratios. These findings and the role of built-in (cut-in) voltages in energy harvesting provide valuable insights for the design of piezotronic junctions to achieve high piezoelectric output and/or rectification ratios. Design aspects of heterojunctions discussed in this manuscript can be applied to other emerging nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Scalable Low-overhead Superconducting Non-local Coupler with Exponentially Enhanced Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction codes with non-local connections such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) incur lower overhead and outperform surface codes on large-scale devices. These codes are not applicable on current superconducting devices with nearest-neighbor connections. To rectify the deficiency in connectivity of superconducting circuit system, we experimentally demonstrate a convenient on-chip coupler of centimeters long and propose an extra coupler layer to map the qubit array to a binary-tree connecting graph. This mapping layout reduces the average qubit entangling distance from O(N) to O(logN), demonstrating an exponentially enhanced connectivity with eliminated crosstalk. The entangling gate with the coupler is performed between two fluxonium qubits, reaching a fidelity of 99.37 % while the system static ZZ rate remains as low as 144 Hz without active cancellation or circuit parameter targeting. With the scalable binary tree structure and high-fidelity non-local entanglement, novel quantum algorithms can be implemented on the superconducting qubit system, positioning it as a strong competitor to other physics systems regarding circuit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Parallel spatial photonic Ising machine using spatial multiplexing for accelerating combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) handles large-scale combinatorial optimization problems owing to optical processing with spatial parallelism. However, iterative feedback in the search for optimal solutions limits processing speed even though the Ising Hamiltonian is computed optically. We propose a parallel spatial photonic Ising machine (pSPIM) utilizing spatial multiplexing to search for an optimal solution efficiently. By employing grating patterns and encoding multiple sets of Ising spins in a phase distribution, several Ising Hamiltonians are computed simultaneously. We demonstrated that Max-Cut problems requiring 100 Ising spins are solved faster as the number of processing units increases. In addition, combining the multicomponent model with parallel processing allows for efficient searching for optimal solutions to problems represented by using interaction matrixes with a rank greater than one. The pSPIM achieves high-speed searching of optimal solutions of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A General Expression for Homogeneous Metasurface Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general approach in metasurface design is to find the unit-cell properties required to achieve a given functionality. This is usually done by modeling the metasurface as a combination of surface electric and magnetic polarization densities, whose parameters are determined by solving the generalized sheet transition conditions. This is a time consuming task, as the so-called boundary conditions needs to be solved per-case basis, depending on the source polarization, angle of incidence, and intended functionality. Evermore, the task complexity increases as factors such as different media around the metasurface and more than one illumination scenario are taken into account. In this work, we provide a general solution for a uniform metasurface homogenized in terms of susceptibilities. With this model, it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the specular scattering produced by a metasurface illuminated with arbitrary illumination and angle of incidence. It is expected that the proposed model can ease the analysis and design of metasurfaces, by providing straight-forward expressions which can be simplified by exploiting the unit-cell symmetries.</description>

      <title>Design of Resistive Frequency Selective Surface based Radar Absorbing Structure-A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, deep learning-based approach for the design of radar absorbing structure using resistive frequency selective surface is proposed. In the present design, reflection coefficient is used as input of deep learning model and the Jerusalem cross based unit cell dimensions is predicted as outcome. Sequential neural network based deep learning model with adaptive moment estimation optimizer is used for designing multi frequency band absorbers. The model is used for designing radar absorber from L to Ka band depending on unit cell parameters and thickness. The outcome of deep learning model is further compared with full-wave simulation software and an excellent match is obtained. The proposed model can be used for the low-cost design of various radar absorbing structures using a single unit cell and thickness across the band of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Design of Cavity Backed Slotted Antenna using Machine Learning Regression Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a regression-based machine learning model is used for the design of cavity backed slotted antenna. This type of antenna is commonly used in military and aviation communication systems. Initial reflection coefficient data of cavity backed slotted antenna is generated using electromagnetic solver. These reflection coefficient data is then used as input for training regression-based machine learning model. The model is trained to predict the dimensions of cavity backed slotted antenna based on the input reflection coefficient for a wide frequency band varying from 1 GHz to 8 GHz. This approach allows for rapid prediction of optimal antenna configurations, reducing the need for repeated physical testing and manual adjustments, may lead to significant amount of design and development cost saving. The proposed model also demonstrates its versatility in predicting multi frequency resonance across 1 GHz to 8 GHz. Also, the proposed approach demonstrates the potential for leveraging machine learning in advanced antenna design, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in practical applications such as radar, military identification systems and secure communication networks.</description>

      <title>Embodying mechano-fluidic memory in soft machines to program behaviors upon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft machines display shape adaptation to external circumstances due to their intrinsic compliance. To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient field-free unconventional spin-orbit torque magnetization switching dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials offers a promising platform for efficient control of magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based devices. However, energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and spin dynamics experiments to understand the basic SOT phenomena in all-2D vdW heterostructures are so far lacking. Here, we demonstrate energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching and tunable magnetization dynamics in a vdW heterostructure comprising out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 and topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4. We measured the non-linear second harmonic Hall signal in TaIrTe4 /Fe3GaTe2 devices to evaluate the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics, which is characterized by a large and tunable out-of-plane damping-like torque. Energy-efficient and deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching is achieved at room temperature with a very low current density. First-principles calculations unveil the origin of the unconventional charge-spin conversion phenomena, considering the crystal symmetry and electronic structure of TaIrTe4. These results establish that all-vdW heterostructures provide a promising route to energy-efficient, field-free, and tunable SOT-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Remote Entangling Gates for Spin Qubits in Quantum Dots using a Charge-Sensitive Superconducting Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to realize microwave-activated CZ gates between two remote spin qubits in quantum dots using a charge-sensitive superconducting coupler. The qubits are longitudinally coupled to the coupler, so that the transition frequency of the coupler depends on the logical qubit states; a capacitive network model using first-quantized charge operators is developed to illustrate this. Driving the coupler transition then implements a conditional phase shift on the qubits. Two pulsing schemes are investigated: a rapid, off-resonant pulse with constant amplitude, and a pulse with envelope engineering that incorporates dynamical decoupling to mitigate charge noise. We develop non-Markovian time-domain simulations to accurately model gate performance in the presence of $1/f^\beta$ charge noise. Simulation results indicate that a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 90% is possible with realistic parameters and noise models.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>
