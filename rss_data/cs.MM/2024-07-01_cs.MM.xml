      <title>MDF: A Dynamic Fusion Model for Multi-modal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fake news detection has received increasing attention from researchers in recent years, especially multi-modal fake news detection containing both text and images.However, many previous works have fed two modal features, text and image, into a binary classifier after a simple concatenation or attention mechanism, in which the features contain a large amount of noise inherent in the data,which in turn leads to intra- and inter-modal uncertainty.In addition, although many methods based on simply splicing two modalities have achieved more prominent results, these methods ignore the drawback of holding fixed weights across modalities, which would lead to some features with higher impact factors being ignored.To alleviate the above problems, we propose a new dynamic fusion framework dubbed MDF for fake news detection.As far as we know, it is the first attempt of dynamic fusion framework in the field of fake news detection.Specifically, our model consists of two main components:(1) UEM as an uncertainty modeling module employing a multi-head attention mechanism to model intra-modal uncertainty; and (2) DFN is a dynamic fusion module based on D-S evidence theory for dynamically fusing the weights of two modalities, text and image.In order to present better results for the dynamic fusion framework, we use GAT for inter-modal uncertainty and weight modeling before DFN.Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the MDF framework.We also conducted a systematic ablation study to gain insight into our motivation and architectural design.We make our model publicly available to:https://github.com/CoisiniStar/MDF</description>

      <title>Network Bending of Diffusion Models for Audio-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the first steps towards the creation of a tool which enables artists to create music visualizations using pre-trained, generative, machine learning models. First, we investigate the application of network bending, the process of applying transforms within the layers of a generative network, to image generation diffusion models by utilizing a range of point-wise, tensor-wise, and morphological operators. We identify a number of visual effects that result from various operators, including some that are not easily recreated with standard image editing tools. We find that this process allows for continuous, fine-grain control of image generation which can be helpful for creative applications. Next, we generate music-reactive videos using Stable Diffusion by passing audio features as parameters to network bending operators. Finally, we comment on certain transforms which radically shift the image and the possibilities of learning more about the latent space of Stable Diffusion based on these transforms.</description>

      <title>MimicMotion: High-Quality Human Motion Video Generation with Confidence-aware Pose Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence has achieved significant advancements in the field of image generation, spawning a variety of applications. However, video generation still faces considerable challenges in various aspects, such as controllability, video length, and richness of details, which hinder the application and popularization of this technology. In this work, we propose a controllable video generation framework, dubbed MimicMotion, which can generate high-quality videos of arbitrary length mimicking specific motion guidance. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several highlights. Firstly, we introduce confidence-aware pose guidance that ensures high frame quality and temporal smoothness. Secondly, we introduce regional loss amplification based on pose confidence, which significantly reduces image distortion. Lastly, for generating long and smooth videos, we propose a progressive latent fusion strategy. By this means, we can produce videos of arbitrary length with acceptable resource consumption. With extensive experiments and user studies, MimicMotion demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in various aspects. Detailed results and comparisons are available on our project page: https://tencent.github.io/MimicMotion .</description>

      <title>MetaDesigner: Advancing Artistic Typography through AI-Driven, User-Centric, and Multilingual WordArt Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MetaDesigner revolutionizes artistic typography synthesis by leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive a design paradigm centered around user engagement. At the core of this framework lies a multi-agent system comprising the Pipeline, Glyph, and Texture agents, which collectively enable the creation of customized WordArt, ranging from semantic enhancements to the imposition of complex textures. MetaDesigner incorporates a comprehensive feedback mechanism that harnesses insights from multimodal models and user evaluations to refine and enhance the design process iteratively. Through this feedback loop, the system adeptly tunes hyperparameters to align with user-defined stylistic and thematic preferences, generating WordArt that not only meets but exceeds user expectations of visual appeal and contextual relevance. Empirical validations highlight MetaDesigner's capability to effectively serve diverse WordArt applications, consistently producing aesthetically appealing and context-sensitive results.</description>

      <title>MIntRec2.0: A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Intent Recognition and Out-of-scope Detection in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition poses significant challenges, requiring the incorporation of non-verbal modalities from real-world contexts to enhance the comprehension of human intentions. Existing benchmark datasets are limited in scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise in multi-turn conversational interactions. We introduce MIntRec2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party conversations. It contains 1,245 dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes. Besides 9,304 in-scope samples, it also includes 5,736 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn contexts, which naturally occur in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements, effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples remains a substantial challenge. Notably, large language models exhibit a significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of machine learning methods in the cognitive intent understanding task. We believe that MIntRec2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and significantly facilitating related applications. The full dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/thuiar/MIntRec2.0.</description>

      <title>Viewport Prediction for Volumetric Video Streaming by Exploring Video Saliency and Trajectory Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</description>

      <title>Kandinsky 3.0 Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Kandinsky 3.0, a large-scale text-to-image generation model based on latent diffusion, continuing the series of text-to-image Kandinsky models and reflecting our progress to achieve higher quality and realism of image generation. In this report we describe the architecture of the model, the data collection procedure, the training technique, and the production system for user interaction. We focus on the key components that, as we have identified as a result of a large number of experiments, had the most significant impact on improving the quality of our model compared to the others. We also describe extensions and applications of our model, including super resolution, inpainting, image editing, image-to-video generation, and a distilled version of Kandinsky 3.0 - Kandinsky 3.1, which does inference in 4 steps of the reverse process and 20 times faster without visual quality decrease. By side-by-side human preferences comparison, Kandinsky becomes better in text understanding and works better on specific domains.
