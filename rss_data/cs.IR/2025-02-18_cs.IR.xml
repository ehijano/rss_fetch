      <title>LSTM-based Selective Dense Text Retrieval Guided by Sparse Lexical Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies fast fusion of dense retrieval and sparse lexical retrieval, and proposes a cluster-based selective dense retrieval method called CluSD guided by sparse lexical retrieval. CluSD takes a lightweight cluster-based approach and exploits the overlap of sparse retrieval results and embedding clusters in a two-stage selection process with an LSTM model to quickly identify relevant clusters while incurring limited extra memory space overhead. CluSD triggers partial dense retrieval and performs cluster-based block disk I/O if needed. This paper evaluates CluSD and compares it with several baselines for searching in-memory and on-disk MS MARCO and BEIR datasets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating improvements on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for property extraction in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research highlights the great potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for constructing Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs). One particularly complex step in this process is relation extraction, aimed at identifying suitable properties to describe the content of research. This study builds directly on previous research of three Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) team members who assessed the readiness of LLMs such as GPT-3.5, Llama 2, and Mistral for property extraction in scientific literature. Given the moderate performance observed, the previous work concluded that fine-tuning is needed to improve these models' alignment with scientific tasks and their emulation of human expertise. Expanding on this prior experiment, this study evaluates the impact of advanced prompt engineering techniques and demonstrates that these techniques can highly significantly enhance the results. Additionally, this study extends the property extraction process to include property matching to existing ORKG properties, which are retrieved via the API. The evaluation reveals that results generated through advanced prompt engineering achieve a higher proportion of matches with ORKG properties, further emphasizing the enhanced alignment achieved. Moreover, this lays the groundwork for addressing challenges such as the inconsistency of ORKG properties, an issue highlighted in prior studies. By assigning unique URIs and using standardized terminology, this work increases the consistency of the properties, fulfilling a crucial aspect of Linked Data and FAIR principles - core commitments of ORKG. This, in turn, significantly enhances the applicability of ORKG content for subsequent tasks such as comparisons of research publications. Finally, the study concludes with recommendations for future improvements in the overall property extraction process.</description>

      <title>Order-agnostic Identifier for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has attracted significant research interest, where item tokenization is a critical step. It involves assigning item identifiers for LLMs to encode user history and generate the next item. Existing approaches leverage either token-sequence identifiers, representing items as discrete token sequences, or single-token identifiers, using ID or semantic embeddings. Token-sequence identifiers face issues such as the local optima problem in beam search and low generation efficiency due to step-by-step generation. In contrast, single-token identifiers fail to capture rich semantics or encode Collaborative Filtering (CF) information, resulting in suboptimal performance.
  To address these issues, we propose two fundamental principles for item identifier design: 1) integrating both CF and semantic information to fully capture multi-dimensional item information, and 2) designing order-agnostic identifiers without token dependency, mitigating the local optima issue and achieving simultaneous generation for generation efficiency. Accordingly, we introduce a novel set identifier paradigm for LLM-based generative recommendation, representing each item as a set of order-agnostic tokens. To implement this paradigm, we propose SETRec, which leverages CF and semantic tokenizers to obtain order-agnostic multi-dimensional tokens. To eliminate token dependency, SETRec uses a sparse attention mask for user history encoding and a query-guided generation mechanism for simultaneous token generation. We instantiate SETRec on T5 and Qwen (from 1.5B to 7B). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness under various scenarios (e.g., full ranking, warm- and cold-start ranking, and various item popularity groups). Moreover, results validate SETRec's superior efficiency and show promising scalability on cold-start items as model sizes increase.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Personalized Recommendation with Set-Theoretic Constraints Using Box Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized item recommendation typically suffers from data sparsity, which is most often addressed by learning vector representations of users and items via low-rank matrix factorization. While this effectively densifies the matrix by assuming users and movies can be represented by linearly dependent latent features, it does not capture more complicated interactions. For example, vector representations struggle with set-theoretic relationships, such as negation and intersection, e.g. recommending a movie that is "comedy and action, but not romance". In this work, we formulate the problem of personalized item recommendation as matrix completion where rows are set-theoretically dependent. To capture this set-theoretic dependence we represent each user and attribute by a hyper-rectangle or box (i.e. a Cartesian product of intervals). Box embeddings can intuitively be understood as trainable Venn diagrams, and thus not only inherently represent similarity (via the Jaccard index), but also naturally and faithfully support arbitrary set-theoretic relationships. Queries involving set-theoretic constraints can be efficiently computed directly on the embedding space by performing geometric operations on the representations. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of box embeddings over vector-based neural methods on both simple and complex item recommendation queries by up to 30 \% overall.</description>

      <title>QuOTE: Question-Oriented Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present QuOTE (Question-Oriented Text Embeddings), a novel enhancement to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, aimed at improving document representation for accurate and nuanced retrieval. Unlike traditional RAG pipelines, which rely on embedding raw text chunks, QuOTE augments chunks with hypothetical questions that the chunk can potentially answer, enriching the representation space. This better aligns document embeddings with user query semantics, and helps address issues such as ambiguity and context-dependent relevance. Through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that QuOTE significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, including in multi-hop question-answering tasks. Our findings highlight the versatility of question generation as a fundamental indexing strategy, opening new avenues for integrating question generation into retrieval-based AI pipelines.</description>

      <title>Improving Scientific Document Retrieval with Concept Coverage-based Query Set Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In specialized fields like the scientific domain, constructing large-scale human-annotated datasets poses a significant challenge due to the need for domain expertise. Recent methods have employed large language models to generate synthetic queries, which serve as proxies for actual user queries. However, they lack control over the content generated, often resulting in incomplete coverage of academic concepts in documents. We introduce Concept Coverage-based Query set Generation (CCQGen) framework, designed to generate a set of queries with comprehensive coverage of the document's concepts. A key distinction of CCQGen is that it adaptively adjusts the generation process based on the previously generated queries. We identify concepts not sufficiently covered by previous queries, and leverage them as conditions for subsequent query generation. This approach guides each new query to complement the previous ones, aiding in a thorough understanding of the document. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCQGen significantly enhances query quality and retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>CSP: A Simulator For Multi-Agent Ranking Competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ranking competitions, document authors compete for the highest rankings by modifying their content in response to past rankings. Previous studies focused on human participants, primarily students, in controlled settings. The rise of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces a new paradigm: using LLMs as document authors. This approach addresses scalability constraints in human-based competitions and reflects the growing role of LLM-generated content on the web-a prime example of ranking competition. We introduce a highly configurable ranking competition simulator that leverages LLMs as document authors. It includes analytical tools to examine the resulting datasets. We demonstrate its capabilities by generating multiple datasets and conducting an extensive analysis. Our code and datasets are publicly available for research.</description>

      <title>MemeSense: An Adaptive In-Context Framework for Social Commonsense Driven Meme Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memes present unique moderation challenges due to their subtle, multimodal interplay of images, text, and social context. Standard systems relying predominantly on explicit textual cues often overlook harmful content camouflaged by irony, symbolism, or cultural references. To address this gap, we introduce MemeSense, an adaptive in-context learning framework that fuses social commonsense reasoning with visually and semantically related reference examples. By encoding crucial task information into a learnable cognitive shift vector, MemeSense effectively balances lexical, visual, and ethical considerations, enabling precise yet context-aware meme intervention. Extensive evaluations on a curated set of implicitly harmful memes demonstrate that MemeSense substantially outperforms strong baselines, paving the way for safer online communities.

      <title>Personalized Ranking on Cascading Behavior Graphs for Accurate Multi-Behavior Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation predicts items a user may purchase by analyzing diverse behaviors like viewing, adding to a cart, and purchasing. Existing methods fall into two categories: representation learning and graph ranking. Representation learning generates user and item embeddings to capture latent interaction patterns, leveraging multi-behavior properties for better generalization. However, these methods often suffer from over-smoothing and bias toward frequent interactions, limiting their expressiveness. Graph ranking methods, on the other hand, directly compute personalized ranking scores, capturing user preferences more effectively. Despite their potential, graph ranking approaches have been primarily explored in single-behavior settings and remain underutilized for multi-behavior recommendation. In this paper, we propose CascadingRank, a novel graph ranking method for multi-behavior recommendation. It models the natural sequence of user behaviors (e.g., viewing, adding to cart, and purchasing) through a cascading behavior graph. An iterative algorithm computes ranking scores, ensuring smoothness, query fitting, and cascading alignment. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CascadingRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with up to 9.56% and 7.16% improvements in HR@10 and NDCG@10, respectively. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis highlighting its effectiveness, convergence, and scalability, showcasing the advantages of graph ranking in multi-behavior recommendation.</description>

      <title>RAG vs. GraphRAG: A Systematic Evaluation and Key Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of LLMs across various tasks by retrieving relevant information from external sources, particularly on text-based data. For structured data, such as knowledge graphs, GraphRAG has been widely used to retrieve relevant information. However, recent studies have revealed that structuring implicit knowledge from text into graphs can benefit certain tasks, extending the application of GraphRAG from graph data to general text-based data. Despite their successful extensions, most applications of GraphRAG for text data have been designed for specific tasks and datasets, lacking a systematic evaluation and comparison between RAG and GraphRAG on widely used text-based benchmarks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate RAG and GraphRAG on well-established benchmark tasks, such as Question Answering and Query-based Summarization. Our results highlight the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG across different tasks and evaluation perspectives. Inspired by these observations, we investigate strategies to integrate their strengths to improve downstream tasks. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the shortcomings of current GraphRAG approaches and outline directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Leave No One Behind: Enhancing Diversity While Maintaining Accuracy in Social Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social recommendation, a branch of algorithms that utilizes social connection information to construct recommender systems, has demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing recommendation accuracy. However, apart from accuracy, the diversity of recommendations also plays a critical role in user engagement. Unfortunately, the impact of social recommendation models on recommendation diversity remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the dual performance of existing social recommendation algorithms in terms of accuracy and diversity. Our empirical findings highlight a concerning trend: social recommendation models tend to decrease diversity, despite their accuracy improvements. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Diversified Social Recommendation (DivSR), which leverages relational knowledge distillation techniques to transfer high-diversity structured knowledge from non-social recommendation models to social recommendation models. DivSR is designed as a simple, model-agnostic framework that integrates seamlessly with existing social recommendation architectures. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DivSR significantly increases diversity without markedly compromising accuracy across various social recommendation backbones, achieving a better accuracy-diversity trade-off. Our code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/ll0ruc/DivSR</description>

      <title>Unbiased Learning to Rank with Query-Level Click Propensity Estimation: Beyond Pointwise Observation and Relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11414v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing unbiased learning-to-rank (ULTR) approaches are based on the user examination hypothesis, which assumes that users will click a result only if it is both relevant and observed (typically modeled by position). However, in real-world scenarios, users often click only one or two results after examining multiple relevant options, due to limited patience or because their information needs have already been satisfied. Motivated by this, we propose a query-level click propensity model to capture the probability that users will click on different result lists, allowing for non-zero probabilities that users may not click on an observed relevant result. We hypothesize that this propensity increases when more potentially relevant results are present, and refer to this user behavior as relevance saturation bias. Our method introduces a Dual Inverse Propensity Weighting (DualIPW) mechanism -- combining query-level and position-level IPW -- to address both relevance saturation and position bias. Through theoretical derivation, we prove that DualIPW can learn an unbiased ranking model. Experiments on the real-world Baidu-ULTR dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ULTR baselines. The code and dataset information can be found at https://github.com/Trustworthy-Information-Access/DualIPW.</description>

      <title>Multi-Turn Multi-Modal Question Clarification for Enhanced Conversational Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational query clarification enables users to refine their search queries through interactive dialogue, improving search effectiveness. Traditional approaches rely on text-based clarifying questions, which often fail to capture complex user preferences, particularly those involving visual attributes. While recent work has explored single-turn multi-modal clarification with images alongside text, such methods do not fully support the progressive nature of user intent refinement over multiple turns. Motivated by this, we introduce the Multi-turn Multi-modal Clarifying Questions (MMCQ) task, which combines text and visual modalities to refine user queries in a multi-turn conversation. To facilitate this task, we create a large-scale dataset named ClariMM comprising over 13k multi-turn interactions and 33k question-answer pairs containing multi-modal clarifying questions. We propose Mario, a retrieval framework that employs a two-phase ranking strategy: initial retrieval with BM25, followed by a multi-modal generative re-ranking model that integrates textual and visual information from conversational history. Our experiments show that multi-turn multi-modal clarification outperforms uni-modal and single-turn approaches, improving MRR by 12.88%. The gains are most significant in longer interactions, demonstrating the value of progressive refinement for complex queries.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Assessment of OpenAlex and Clarivate Scholar ID with an LLM-Assisted Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantitative SciSci (science of science) studies, accurately identifying individual scholars is paramount for scientific data analysis. However, the variability in how names are represented-due to commonality, abbreviations, and different spelling conventions-complicates this task. While identifier systems like ORCID are being developed, many scholars remain unregistered, and numerous publications are not included. Scholarly databases such as Clarivate and OpenAlex have introduced their own ID systems as preliminary name disambiguation solutions. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these systems across different groups to determine their suitability for various application scenarios. We sampled authors from the top quartile (Q1) of Web of Science (WOS) journals based on country, discipline, and number of corresponding author papers. For each group, we selected 100 scholars and meticulously annotated all their papers using a Search-enhanced Large Language Model method. Using these annotations, we identified the corresponding IDs in OpenAlex and Clarivate, extracted all associated papers, filtered for Q1 WOS journals, and calculated precision and recall by comparing against the annotated dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating natural language explanations for recommendations has become increasingly important in recommender systems. Traditional approaches typically treat user reviews as ground truth for explanations and focus on improving review prediction accuracy by designing various model architectures. However, due to limitations in data scale and model capability, these explanations often fail to meet key user-centric aspects such as factuality, personalization, and sentiment coherence, significantly reducing their overall helpfulness to users. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that refines initial explanations generated by existing explainable recommender models during the inference stage to enhance their quality in multiple aspects. Specifically, we introduce a multi-agent collaborative refinement framework based on large language models. To ensure alignment between the refinement process and user demands, we employ a plan-then-refine pattern to perform targeted modifications. To enable continuous improvements, we design a hierarchical reflection mechanism that provides feedback on the refinement process from both strategic and content perspectives. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Open-Ended and Knowledge-Intensive Video Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11747v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video question answering that requires external knowledge beyond the visual content remains a significant challenge in AI systems. While models can effectively answer questions based on direct visual observations, they often falter when faced with questions requiring broader contextual knowledge. To address this limitation, we investigate knowledge-intensive video question answering (KI-VideoQA) through the lens of multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, with a particular focus on handling open-ended questions rather than just multiple-choice formats. Our comprehensive analysis examines various retrieval augmentation approaches using cutting-edge retrieval and vision language models, testing both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations. We investigate several critical dimensions: the interplay between different information sources and modalities, strategies for integrating diverse multi-modal contexts, and the dynamics between query formulation and retrieval result utilization. Our findings reveal that while retrieval augmentation shows promise in improving model performance, its success is heavily dependent on the chosen modality and retrieval methodology. The study also highlights the critical role of query construction and retrieval depth optimization in effective knowledge integration. Through our proposed approach, we achieve a substantial 17.5% improvement in accuracy on multiple choice questions in the KnowIT VQA dataset, establishing new state-of-the-art performance levels.</description>

      <title>FairDiverse: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Fair and Diverse Information Retrieval Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern information retrieval (IR). achieving more than just accuracy is essential to sustaining a healthy ecosystem, especially when addressing fairness and diversity considerations. To meet these needs, various datasets, algorithms, and evaluation frameworks have been introduced. However, these algorithms are often tested across diverse metrics, datasets, and experimental setups, leading to inconsistencies and difficulties in direct comparisons. This highlights the need for a comprehensive IR toolkit that enables standardized evaluation of fairness- and diversity-aware algorithms across different IR tasks. To address this challenge, we present FairDiverse, an open-source and standardized toolkit. FairDiverse offers a framework for integrating fair and diverse methods, including pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques, at different stages of the IR pipeline. The toolkit supports the evaluation of 28 fairness and diversity algorithms across 16 base models, covering two core IR tasks (search and recommendation) thereby establishing a comprehensive benchmark. Moreover, FairDiverse is highly extensible, providing multiple APIs that empower IR researchers to swiftly develop and evaluate their own fairness and diversity aware models, while ensuring fair comparisons with existing baselines. The project is open-sourced and available on https://github.com/XuChen0427/FairDiverse.</description>

      <title>Joint Evaluation of Fairness and Relevance in Recommender Systems with Pareto Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness and relevance are two important aspects of recommender systems (RSs). Typically, they are evaluated either (i) separately by individual measures of fairness and relevance, or (ii) jointly using a single measure that accounts for fairness with respect to relevance. However, approach (i) often does not provide a reliable joint estimate of the goodness of the models, as it has two different best models: one for fairness and another for relevance. Approach (ii) is also problematic because these measures tend to be ad-hoc and do not relate well to traditional relevance measures, like NDCG. Motivated by this, we present a new approach for jointly evaluating fairness and relevance in RSs: Distance to Pareto Frontier (DPFR). Given some user-item interaction data, we compute their Pareto frontier for a pair of existing relevance and fairness measures, and then use the distance from the frontier as a measure of the jointly achievable fairness and relevance. Our approach is modular and intuitive as it can be computed with existing measures. Experiments with 4 RS models, 3 re-ranking strategies, and 6 datasets show that existing metrics have inconsistent associations with our Pareto-optimal solution, making DPFR a more robust and theoretically well-founded joint measure for assessing fairness and relevance.

      <title>Fast or Better? Balancing Accuracy and Cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Flexible User Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to mitigate large language model (LLM) hallucinations by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. However, existing RAG frameworks often apply retrieval indiscriminately,leading to inefficiencies-over-retrieving when unnecessary or failing to retrieve iteratively when required for complex reasoning. Recent adaptive retrieval strategies, though adaptively navigates these retrieval strategies, predict only based on query complexity and lacks user-driven flexibility, making them infeasible for diverse user application needs. In this paper, we introduce a novel user-controllable RAG framework that enables dynamic adjustment of the accuracy-cost trade-off. Our approach leverages two classifiers: one trained to prioritize accuracy and another to prioritize retrieval efficiency. Via an interpretable control parameter $\alpha$, users can seamlessly navigate between minimal-cost retrieval and high-accuracy retrieval based on their specific requirements. We empirically demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy, retrieval cost, and user controllability, making it a practical and adaptable solution for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Implementing agile healthcare frame works in the context of low income countries: Proposed Framework and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agile healthcare frameworks, derived from methodologies in IT and manufacturing, offer transformative potential for low-income regions. This study explores Agile integration in resource-constrained environments, focusing on Ghana. Key benefits include adaptability, iterative planning, and stakeholder collaboration to address infrastructure gaps, workforce shortages, and the "know-do gap." Digital tools like mobile health (mHealth) applications and the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS) demonstrate Agile scalability and efficacy in improving outcomes and resource allocation. Policy alignment, such as through Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), is crucial for sustaining these practices. Findings reveal Agile ability to enable real-time decision-making, foster community engagement, and drive interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper provides actionable strategies and systemic innovations, positioning Agile as a scalable model for equitable, high-quality care delivery in other low-income regions.</description>

      <title>TrueReason: An Exemplar Personalised Learning System Integrating Reasoning with Foundational Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalised education is one of the domains that can greatly benefit from the most recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM). However, it is also one of the most challenging applications due to the cognitive complexity of teaching effectively while personalising the learning experience to suit independent learners. We hypothesise that one promising approach to excelling in such demanding use cases is using a \emph{society of minds}. In this chapter, we present TrueReason, an exemplar personalised learning system that integrates a multitude of specialised AI models that can mimic micro skills that are composed together by a LLM to operationalise planning and reasoning. The architecture of the initial prototype is presented while describing two micro skills that have been incorporated in the prototype. The proposed system demonstrates the first step in building sophisticated AI systems that can take up very complex cognitive tasks that are demanded by domains such as education.</description>

      <title>Towards Copyright Protection for Knowledge Bases of Retrieval-augmented Language Models via Ownership Verification with Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world applications through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms to supplement their responses with up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge. However, the valuable and often proprietary nature of the knowledge bases used in RAG introduces the risk of unauthorized usage by adversaries. Existing methods that can be generalized as watermarking techniques to protect these knowledge bases typically involve poisoning attacks. However, these methods require to alter the results of verification samples (\eg, generating incorrect outputs), inevitably making them susceptible to anomaly detection and even introduce new security risks. To address these challenges, we propose \name{} for `harmless' copyright protection of knowledge bases. Instead of manipulating LLM's final output, \name{} implants distinct verification behaviors in the space of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, maintaining the correctness of the final answer. Our method has three main stages: (1) \textbf{Generating CoTs}: For each verification question, we generate two CoTs, including a target CoT for building watermark behaviors; (2) \textbf{Optimizing Watermark Phrases and Target CoTs}: We optimize them to minimize retrieval errors under the black-box setting of suspicious LLM, ensuring that the watermarked verification queries activate the target CoTs without being activated in non-watermarked ones; (3) \textbf{Ownership Verification}: We exploit a pairwise Wilcoxon test to statistically verify whether a suspicious LLM is augmented with the protected knowledge base by comparing its responses to watermarked and benign verification queries. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that \name{} effectively protects knowledge bases against unauthorized usage while preserving the integrity and performance of the RAG.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Conversational Agents from Open-Source Large Language Models with Illocutionary Force and Document-Based Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present a novel way of computationally analysing and extracting illocutionary forces from dialogue using Bert-based Large Language Models, and demonstrate how these features impact the response of a conversational agent guided by a document-based knowledge bank demonstrated by a bespoke web conversational chat agent system developed. Our proposed illocutionary force extraction and classification technique is the first of its kind using the Argument Interchange Format (AIF) Dataset, showing an improved performance compared to two methods for carrying out similar tasks with a macro F1 of approximately 45%. When we evaluated the system based on 2 knowledge files, with 2 user queries each, across 5 open-source large language models (LLMs) using 10 standard metrics we found out that larger open-source models, such as Llama2:13b and Llama3-chatqa-latest, demonstrated an improved alignment when the user illocutionary force was included with their query, achieving higher QA and linguistic similarity scores. The smaller models on the other hand like Tinyllama:latest showed an increased perplexity and mixed performance, which explicitly indicated struggles in processing queries that explicitly included illocutionary forces. The results from the analysis highlight the potential of illocutionary force to enhance conversational depth while underscoring the need for model-specific optimizations to address increased computational costs and response times.</description>

Abstract: Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models. While these models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets, real-world applications demand domain-specific evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a specialized counterpart to MTEB designed for the financial domain. FinMTEB comprises 64 financial domain-specific embedding datasets across 7 tasks that cover diverse textual types in both Chinese and English, such as financial news articles, corporate annual reports, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and earnings call transcripts. We also develop a finance-adapted model, FinPersona-E5, using a persona-based data synthetic method to cover diverse financial embedding tasks for training. Through extensive evaluation of 15 embedding models, including FinPersona-E5, we show three key findings: (1) performance on general-purpose benchmarks shows limited correlation with financial domain tasks; (2) domain-adapted models consistently outperform their general-purpose counterparts; and (3) surprisingly, a simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach outperforms sophisticated dense embeddings in financial Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks, underscoring current limitations in dense embedding techniques. Our work establishes a robust evaluation framework for financial NLP applications and provides crucial insights for developing domain-specific embedding models.</description>

      <title>Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational theory of memory is proposed to explain how we can accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded storage space. Memory is stored as statistics, organized into complex structures that are constantly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. This process, driven by space constraints, is guided by heuristics that optimize the memory for future needs. Sensory input is rapidly encoded as simple statistics that are more slowly elaborated into more abstract constructs. This theory differs from previous accounts of memory by (a) its reliance on statistics, (b) its use of heuristics to guide the choice of statistics, and (c) the emphasis on memory as a process that is intensive, complex, and expensive. The theory is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive knowledge of memory, and bring us closer to an understanding of memory in functional and mechanistic terms.</description>

      <title>Gumbel Reranking: Differentiable End-to-End Reranker Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RAG systems rely on rerankers to identify relevant documents. However, fine-tuning these models remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated query-document pairs. Existing distillation-based approaches suffer from training-inference misalignment and fail to capture interdependencies among candidate documents. To overcome these limitations, we reframe the reranking process as an attention-mask problem and propose Gumbel Reranking, an end-to-end training framework for rerankers aimed at minimizing the training-inference gap. In our approach, reranker optimization is reformulated as learning a stochastic, document-wise Top-$k$ attention mask using the Gumbel Trick and Relaxed Top-$k$ Sampling. This formulation enables end-to-end optimization by minimizing the overall language loss. Experiments across various settings consistently demonstrate performance gains, including a 10.4\% improvement in recall on HotpotQA for distinguishing indirectly relevant documents.</description>

      <title>GLTW: Joint Improved Graph Transformer and LLM via Three-Word Language for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing or incomplete facts, is a crucial task for KGs. However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Multi-relational Parallel Graph Retrieval for Web-scale Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web recommendations provide personalized items from massive catalogs for users, which rely heavily on retrieval stages to trade off the effectiveness and efficiency of selecting a small relevant set from billion-scale candidates in online digital platforms. As one of the largest Chinese search engine and news feed providers, Baidu resorts to Deep Neural Network (DNN) and graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) algorithms for accurate relevance estimation and efficient search for relevant items. However, current retrieval at Baidu fails in comprehensive user-item relational understanding due to dissected interaction modeling, and performs inefficiently in large-scale graph-based ANNS because of suboptimal traversal navigation and the GPU computational bottleneck under high concurrency. To this end, we propose a GPU-accelerated Multi-relational Parallel Graph Retrieval (GMP-GR) framework to achieve effective yet efficient retrieval in web-scale recommendations. First, we propose a multi-relational user-item relevance metric learning method that unifies diverse user behaviors through multi-objective optimization and employs a self-covariant loss to enhance pathfinding performance. Second, we develop a hierarchical parallel graph-based ANNS to boost graph retrieval throughput, which conducts breadth-depth-balanced searches on a large-scale item graph and cost-effectively handles irregular neural computation via adaptive aggregation on GPUs. In addition, we integrate system optimization strategies in the deployment of GMP-GR in Baidu. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GMP-GR in retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Deployed across more than twenty applications at Baidu, GMP-GR serves hundreds of millions of users with a throughput exceeding one hundred million requests per second.</description>

      <title>FaMTEB: Massive Text Embedding Benchmark in Persian Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Persian (Farsi) text embeddings, built upon the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB). Our benchmark includes 63 datasets spanning seven different tasks: classification, clustering, pair classification, reranking, retrieval, summary retrieval, and semantic textual similarity. The datasets are formed as a combination of existing, translated, and newly generated data, offering a diverse evaluation framework for Persian language models. Given the increasing use of text embedding models in chatbots, evaluation datasets are becoming inseparable ingredients in chatbot challenges and Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. As a contribution, we include chatbot evaluation datasets in the MTEB benchmark for the first time. In addition, in this paper, we introduce the new task of summary retrieval which is not part of the tasks included in standard MTEB. Another contribution of this paper is the introduction of a substantial number of new Persian language NLP datasets suitable for training and evaluation, some of which have no previous counterparts in Persian. We evaluate the performance of several Persian and multilingual embedding models in a range of tasks. This work introduces an open-source benchmark with datasets, code and a public leaderboard.</description>

      <title>ChordFormer: A Conformer-Based Architecture for Large-Vocabulary Audio Chord Recognition</title>

Abstract: Chord recognition serves as a critical task in music information retrieval due to the abstract and descriptive nature of chords in music analysis. While audio chord recognition systems have achieved significant accuracy for small vocabularies (e.g., major/minor chords), large-vocabulary chord recognition remains a challenging problem. This complexity also arises from the inherent long-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented in most datasets, leading to insufficient training samples. Effective chord recognition requires leveraging contextual information from audio sequences, yet existing models, such as combinations of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional long short-term memory networks, and bidirectional transformers, face limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and exhibit suboptimal performance on large-vocabulary chord recognition tasks. This work proposes ChordFormer, a novel conformer-based architecture designed to tackle structural chord recognition (e.g., triads, bass, sevenths) for large vocabularies. ChordFormer leverages conformer blocks that integrate convolutional neural networks with transformers, thus enabling the model to capture both local patterns and global dependencies effectively. By addressing challenges such as class imbalance through a reweighted loss function and structured chord representations, ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a 2% improvement in frame-wise accuracy and a 6% increase in class-wise accuracy on large-vocabulary chord datasets. Furthermore, ChordFormer excels in handling class imbalance, providing robust and balanced recognition across chord types. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical music knowledge and practical applications, advancing the field of large-vocabulary chord recognition.</description>

      <title>REVERSUM: A Multi-staged Retrieval-Augmented Generation Method to Enhance Wikipedia Tail Biographies through Personal Narratives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wikipedia is an invaluable resource for factual information about a wide range of entities. However, the quality of articles on less-known entities often lags behind that of the well-known ones. This study proposes a novel approach to enhancing Wikipedia's B and C category biography articles by leveraging personal narratives such as autobiographies and biographies. By utilizing a multi-staged retrieval-augmented generation technique -- REVerSum -- we aim to enrich the informational content of these lesser-known articles. Our study reveals that personal narratives can significantly improve the quality of Wikipedia articles, providing a rich source of reliable information that has been underutilized in previous studies. Based on crowd-based evaluation, REVerSum generated content outperforms the best performing baseline by 17% in terms of integrability to the original Wikipedia article and 28.5\% in terms of informativeness.

      <title>Cross-domain Recommender Systems via Multimodal Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) has emerged as one of the most prominent implementation strategies for building recommender systems. The key idea is to exploit the usage patterns of individuals to generate personalized recommendations. CF techniques, especially for newly launched platforms, often face a critical issue known as the data sparsity problem, which greatly limits their performance. Cross-domain CF alleviates the problem of data sparsity by finding a common set of entities (users or items) across the domains, which then act as a conduit for knowledge transfer. Nevertheless, most real-world datasets are collected from different domains, so they often lack information about anchor points or reference information for entity alignment. This paper introduces a domain adaptation technique to align the embeddings of entities across domains. Our approach first exploits the available textual and visual information to independently learn a multi-view latent representation for each entity in the auxiliary and target domains. The different representations of the entity are then fused to generate the corresponding unified representation. A domain classifier is then trained to learn the embedding for the domain alignment by fixing the unified features as the anchor points. Experiments on \AS{four} publicly available benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in paper submissions to academic conferences, the need for automated and accurate paper-reviewer matching is more critical than ever. Previous efforts in this area have considered various factors to assess the relevance of a reviewer's expertise to a paper, such as the semantic similarity, shared topics, and citation connections between the paper and the reviewer's previous works. However, most of these studies focus on only one factor, resulting in an incomplete evaluation of the paper-reviewer relevance. To address this issue, we propose a unified model for paper-reviewer matching that jointly considers semantic, topic, and citation factors. To be specific, during training, we instruction-tune a contextualized language model shared across all factors to capture their commonalities and characteristics; during inference, we chain the three factors to enable step-by-step, coarse-to-fine search for qualified reviewers given a submission. Experiments on four datasets (one of which is newly contributed by us) spanning various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, information retrieval, and data mining consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Chain-of-Factors model in comparison with state-of-the-art paper-reviewer matching methods and scientific pre-trained language models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15490v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has shown great competence in image and audio generation tasks. However, there exist few attempts to employ DDPM in the text generation, especially review generation under recommendation systems. Fueled by the predicted reviews explainability that justifies recommendations could assist users better understand the recommended items and increase the transparency of recommendation system, we propose a Diffusion Model-based Review Generation towards EXplainable Recommendation named Diffusion-EXR. Diffusion-EXR corrupts the sequence of review embeddings by incrementally introducing varied levels of Gaussian noise to the sequence of word embeddings and learns to reconstruct the original word representations in the reverse process. The nature of DDPM enables our lightweight Transformer backbone to perform excellently in the recommendation review generation task. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that Diffusion-EXR can achieve state-of-the-art review generation for recommendation on two publicly available benchmark datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective recommender systems play a crucial role in accurately capturing user and item attributes that mirror individual preferences. Some existing recommendation techniques have started to shift their focus towards modeling various types of interactive relations between users and items in real-world recommendation scenarios, such as clicks, marking favorites, and purchases on online shopping platforms. Nevertheless, these approaches still grapple with two significant challenges: (1) Insufficient modeling and exploitation of the impact of various behavior patterns formed by multiplex relations between users and items on representation learning, and (2) ignoring the effect of different relations within behavior patterns on the target relation in recommender system scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel recommendation framework, Dual-Channel Multiplex Graph Neural Network (DCMGNN), which addresses the aforementioned challenges. It incorporates an explicit behavior pattern representation learner to capture the behavior patterns composed of multiplex user-item interactive relations, and includes a relation chain representation learner and a relation chain-aware encoder to discover the impact of various auxiliary relations on the target relation, the dependencies between different relations, and mine the appropriate order of relations in a behavior pattern. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our \model surpasses various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. It outperforms the best baselines by 10.06% and 12.15% on average across all datasets in terms of Recall@10 and NDCG@10 respectively.</description>

      <title>Balancing Embedding Spectrum for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems heavily rely on high-quality representations learned from high-dimensional sparse data. While significant efforts have been invested in designing powerful algorithms for extracting user preferences, the factors contributing to good representations have remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we shed light on an issue in the existing pair-wise learning paradigm (i.e., the embedding collapse problem), that the representations tend to span a subspace of the whole embedding space, leading to a suboptimal solution and reducing the model capacity. Specifically, optimization on observed interactions is equivalent to a low pass filter causing users/items to have the same representations and resulting in a complete collapse. While negative sampling acts as a high pass filter to alleviate the collapse by balancing the embedding spectrum, its effectiveness is only limited to certain losses, which still leads to an incomplete collapse. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method called DirectSpec, acting as a reliable all pass filter to balance the spectrum distribution of the embeddings during training, ensuring that users/items effectively span the entire embedding space. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of DirectSpec from a decorrelation perspective and propose an enhanced variant, DirectSpec+, which employs self-paced gradients to optimize irrelevant samples more effectively. Moreover, we establish a close connection between DirectSpec+ and uniformity, demonstrating that contrastive learning (CL) can alleviate the collapse issue by indirectly balancing the spectrum. Finally, we implement DirectSpec and DirectSpec+ on two popular recommender models: MF and LightGCN. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency over competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>FunnelRAG: A Coarse-to-Fine Progressive Retrieval Paradigm for RAG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevails in Large Language Models. It mainly consists of retrieval and generation. The retrieval modules (a.k.a. retrievers) aim to find useful information used to facilitate the generation modules (a.k.a. generators). As such, generators' performance largely depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of retrievers. However, the widely used retrieval paradigm remains flat. It treats retrieval procedures as a one-off deal with constant granularity. Despite effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) flat retrieval exerts a significant burden on one retriever; (2) constant granularity limits the ceiling of retrieval performance. In this work, we propose a progressive retrieval paradigm with coarse-to-fine granularity for RAG, termed FunnelRAG, so as to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, FunnelRAG establishes a progressive retrieval pipeline by collaborating coarse-to-fine granularity, large-to-small quantity, and low-to-high capacity, which can relieve the burden on one retriever and also promote the ceiling of retrieval performance. Extensive experiments manifest that FunnelRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while the time overhead is reduced by nearly 40 percent.</description>

      <title>Triple Modality Fusion: Aligning Visual, Textual, and Graph Data with Large Language Models for Multi-Behavior Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating diverse data modalities is crucial for enhancing the performance of personalized recommendation systems. Traditional models, which often rely on singular data sources, lack the depth needed to accurately capture the multifaceted nature of item features and user behaviors. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-behavior recommendations, leveraging the fusion of triple-modality, which is visual, textual, and graph data through alignment with large language models (LLMs). By incorporating visual information, we capture contextual and aesthetic item characteristics; textual data provides insights into user interests and item features in detail; and graph data elucidates relationships within the item-behavior heterogeneous graphs. Our proposed model called Triple Modality Fusion (TMF) utilizes the power of LLMs to align and integrate these three modalities, achieving a comprehensive representation of user behaviors. The LLM models the user's interactions including behaviors and item features in natural languages. Initially, the LLM is warmed up using only natural language-based prompts. We then devise the modality fusion module based on cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms to integrate different modalities from other models into the same embedding space and incorporate them into an LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving recommendation accuracy. Further ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our model design and benefits of the TMF.</description>

      <title>RuleRAG: Rule-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Language Models for Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown promising potential in knowledge intensive question answering (QA). However, existing approaches only consider the query itself, neither specifying the retrieval preferences for the retrievers nor informing the generators of how to refer to the retrieved documents for the answers, which poses a significant challenge to the QA performance. To address these issues, we propose Rule-guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LMs, which explicitly introduces rules for in-context learning (RuleRAG-ICL) to guide retrievers to recall related documents in the directions of rules and uniformly guide generators to reason attributed by the same rules. Moreover, most existing RAG datasets were constructed without considering rules and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are recognized as providing high-quality rules. Therefore, we construct five rule-aware RAG benchmarks for QA, RuleQA, based on KGs to stress the significance of retrieval and reasoning with rules. Experiments on RuleQA demonstrate RuleRAG-ICL improves the retrieval quality of +89.2% in Recall@10 and answer accuracy of +103.1% in Exact Match, and RuleRAG-FT yields more enhancement. In addition, experiments on four existing RAG datasets show RuleRAG is also effective by offering rules in RuleQA to them, further proving the generalization of rule guidance in RuleRAG.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Dilemmas: Does Claim Decomposition Boost or Burden Fact-Checking Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fact-checking pipelines increasingly adopt the Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm, where texts are broken down into smaller claims for individual verification and subsequently combined for a veracity decision. While decomposition is widely-adopted in such pipelines, its effects on final fact-checking performance remain underexplored. Some studies have reported improvements from decompostition, while others have observed performance declines, indicating its inconsistent impact. To date, no comprehensive analysis has been conducted to understand this variability. To address this gap, we present an in-depth analysis that explicitly examines the impact of decomposition on downstream verification performance. Through error case inspection and experiments, we introduce a categorization of decomposition errors and reveal a trade-off between accuracy gains and the noise introduced through decomposition. Our analysis provides new insights into understanding current system's instability and offers guidance for future studies toward improving claim decomposition in fact-checking pipelines.</description>

      <title>Multi-granularity Interest Retrieval and Refinement Network for Long-Term User Behavior Modeling in CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction is crucial for online personalization platforms. Recent advancements have shown that modeling rich user behaviors can significantly improve the performance of CTR prediction. Current long-term user behavior modeling algorithms predominantly follow two cascading stages. The first stage retrieves subsequence related to the target item from the long-term behavior sequence, while the second stage models the relationship between the subsequence and the target item. Despite significant progress, these methods have two critical flaws. First, the retrieval query typically includes only target item information, limiting the ability to capture the user's diverse interests. Second, relational information, such as sequential and interactive information within the subsequence, is frequently overlooked. Therefore, it requires to be further mined to more accurately model user interests.
  To this end, we propose Multi-granularity Interest Retrieval and Refinement Network (MIRRN). Specifically, we first construct queries based on behaviors observed at different time scales to obtain subsequences, each capturing users' interest at various granularities. We then introduce an noval multi-head Fourier transformer to efficiently learn sequential and interactive information within the subsequences, leading to more accurate modeling of user interests. Finally, we employ multi-head target attention to adaptively assess the impact of these multi-granularity interests on the target item. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MIRRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, an A/B test shows that MIRRN increases the average number of listening songs by 1.32% and the average time of listening songs by 0.55% on the Huawei Music App. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/MIRRN.</description>

      <title>USM: Unbiased Survey Modeling for Limiting Negative User Experiences in Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing negative user experiences is essential for the success of recommendation platforms. Exposing users to inappropriate content could not only adversely affect users' psychological well-beings, but also potentially drive users away from the platform, sabotaging the platform's long-term success. However, recommendation algorithms tend to weigh more heavily on positive feedback signals due to the scarcity of negative ones, which may result in the neglect of valuable negative user feedback. In this paper, we propose an approach aimed at limiting negative user experiences. Our method primarily relies on distributing in-feed surveys to the users, modeling the users' feedback collected from the survey, and integrating the model predictions into the recommendation system. We further enhance the baseline survey model by integrating the Learning Hidden Unit Contributions module and the Squeeze-and-Excitation module. In addition, we strive to resolve the problem of response Bias by applying a survey-submit model; The A/B testing results indicate a reduction in survey sexual rate and survey inappropriate rate, ranging from -1.44\% to -3.9\%. Additionally, we compared our methods against an online baseline that does not incorporate our approach. The results indicate that our approach significantly reduces the report rate and dislike rate by 1\% to 2.27\% compared to the baseline, confirming the effectiveness of our methods in enhancing user experience. After we launched the survey model based our approach on our platform, the model is able to bring reductions of 1.75\%, 2.57\%, 2.06\% on reports, dislikes, survey inappropriate rate, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multimodal semantic retrieval for product search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic retrieval (also known as dense retrieval) based on textual data has been extensively studied for both web search and product search application fields, where the relevance of a query and a potential target document is computed by their dense vector representation comparison. Product image is crucial for e-commerce search interactions and is a key factor for customers at product explorations. However, its impact on semantic retrieval has not been well studied yet. In this research, we build a multimodal representation for product items in e-commerce search in contrast to pure-text representation of products, and investigate the impact of such representations. The models are developed and evaluated on e-commerce datasets. We demonstrate that a multimodal representation scheme for a product can show improvement either on purchase recall or relevance accuracy in semantic retrieval. Additionally, we provide numerical analysis for exclusive matches retrieved by a multimodal semantic retrieval model versus a text-only semantic retrieval model, to demonstrate the validation of multimodal solutions.</description>

      <title>Reason4Rec: Large Language Models for Recommendation with Deliberative User Preference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advancements in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with recommendation tasks have shown great potential and promising performance overall, these aligned recommendation LLMs still face challenges in complex scenarios. This is primarily due to the current alignment approach focusing on optimizing LLMs to generate user feedback directly, without incorporating deliberation. To overcome this limitation and develop more reliable LLMs for recommendations, we propose a new Deliberative Recommendation task, which incorporates explicit reasoning about user preferences as an additional alignment goal. We then introduce the Reasoning-powered Recommender framework for deliberative user preference alignment, designed to enhance reasoning capabilities by utilizing verbalized user feedback in a step-wise manner to tackle this task. The framework employs collaborative step-wise experts and tailored training strategies for each expert. Experimental results across three real-world datasets demonstrate the rationality of the deliberative task formulation and the superior performance of the proposed framework in improving both prediction accuracy and reasoning quality.</description>

      <title>Large Memory Network for Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling user behavior sequences in recommender systems is essential for understanding user preferences over time, enabling personalized and accurate recommendations for improving user retention and enhancing business values. Despite its significance, there are two challenges for current sequential modeling approaches. From the spatial dimension, it is difficult to mutually perceive similar users' interests for a generalized intention understanding; from the temporal dimension, current methods are generally prone to forgetting long-term interests due to the fixed-length input sequence. In this paper, we present Large Memory Network (LMN), providing a novel idea by compressing and storing user history behavior information in a large-scale memory block. With the elaborated online deployment strategy, the memory block can be easily scaled up to million-scale in the industry. Extensive offline comparison experiments, memory scaling up experiments, and online A/B test on Douyin E-Commerce Search (ECS) are performed, validating the superior performance of LMN. Currently, LMN has been fully deployed in Douyin ECS, serving millions of users each day.</description>

      <title>FlashCheck: Exploration of Efficient Evidence Retrieval for Fast Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advances in digital tools have led to the rampant spread of misinformation. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is cumbersome and not scalable. It is essential for automated fact-checking to be efficient for aiding in combating misinformation in real-time and at the source. Fact-checking pipelines primarily comprise a knowledge retrieval component which extracts relevant knowledge to fact-check a claim from large knowledge sources like Wikipedia and a verification component. The existing works primarily focus on the fact-verification part rather than evidence retrieval from large data collections, which often face scalability issues for practical applications such as live fact-checking. In this study, we address this gap by exploring various methods for indexing a succinct set of factual statements from large collections like Wikipedia to enhance the retrieval phase of the fact-checking pipeline. We also explore the impact of vector quantization to further improve the efficiency of pipelines that employ dense retrieval approaches for first-stage retrieval. We study the efficiency and effectiveness of the approaches on fact-checking datasets such as HoVer and WiCE, leveraging Wikipedia as the knowledge source. We also evaluate the real-world utility of the efficient retrieval approaches by fact-checking 2024 presidential debate and also open source the collection of claims with corresponding labels identified in the debate. Through a combination of indexed facts together with Dense retrieval and Index compression, we achieve up to a 10.0x speedup on CPUs and more than a 20.0x speedup on GPUs compared to the classical fact-checking pipelines over large collections.</description>

      <title>Graph Foundation Models for Recommendation: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) serve as a fundamental tool for navigating the vast expanse of online information, with deep learning advancements playing an increasingly important role in improving ranking accuracy. Among these, graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at extracting higher-order structural information, while large language models (LLMs) are designed to process and comprehend natural language, making both approaches highly effective and widely adopted. Recent research has focused on graph foundation models (GFMs), which integrate the strengths of GNNs and LLMs to model complex RS problems more efficiently by leveraging the graph-based structure of user-item relationships alongside textual understanding. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of GFM-based RS technologies by introducing a clear taxonomy of current approaches, diving into methodological details, and highlighting key challenges and future directions. By synthesizing recent advancements, we aim to offer valuable insights into the evolving landscape of GFM-based recommender systems.</description>

      <title>QA-Expand: Multi-Question Answer Generation for Enhanced Query Expansion in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Query expansion is widely used in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve search outcomes by enriching queries with additional contextual information. Although recent Large Language Model (LLM) based methods generate pseudo-relevant content and expanded terms via multiple prompts, they often yield repetitive, narrow expansions that lack the diverse context needed to retrieve all relevant information. In this paper, we introduce QA-Expand, a novel and effective framework for query expansion. It first generates multiple relevant questions from the initial query and subsequently produces corresponding pseudo-answers as surrogate documents. A feedback model further rewrites and filters these answers to ensure only the most informative augmentations are incorporated. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as BEIR and TREC demonstrate that QA-Expand enhances retrieval performance by up to 13% over state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust solution for modern retrieval challenges.</description>

      <title>CuriousLLM: Elevating Multi-Document Question Answering with LLM-Enhanced Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in open-domain question answering. However, they continue to face challenges such as hallucinations and knowledge cutoffs. These issues can be mitigated through in-context learning by providing LLMs with relevant context before generating answers. Recent literature proposes Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which integrates knowledge graphs with an LLM-based traversal agent to substantially enhance document retrieval quality. However, KGP requires costly fine-tuning with large datasets and remains prone to hallucination. In this paper, we propose CuriousLLM, an enhancement that integrates a curiosity-driven reasoning mechanism into an LLM agent. This mechanism enables the agent to generate relevant follow-up questions, thereby guiding the information retrieval process more efficiently. Central to our approach is the development of the new Follow-upQA dataset, which includes questions and supporting evidence as input, with follow-up questions serving as ground truths. These follow-up questions either inquire about what is still missing to fully answer the user's query or use special tokens to signify that the retrieved evidence is sufficient. Our experiments show that CuriousLLM significantly boosts LLM performance in multi-document question answering (MD-QA), circumventing the substantial computational costs and latency from the original KGP framework.</description>

      <title>ChatQA 2: Bridging the Gap to Proprietary LLMs in Long Context and RAG Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChatQA 2, an Llama 3.0-based model with a 128K context window, designed to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs and leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09) in long context understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks. We open-source the model weights, training data, and the evaluation setup for the for the community: https://chatqa2-project.github.io/</description>

      <title>Multi-Source Knowledge Pruning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Benchmark and Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach to mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs) through the integration of external knowledge. While numerous efforts, most studies focus on a single type of external knowledge source. In contrast, most real-world applications involve diverse knowledge from various sources, a scenario that has been relatively underexplored. The main dilemma is the lack of a suitable dataset incorporating multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark dataset that combines structured and unstructured knowledge across diverse and complementary domains. Building upon the dataset, we identify the limitations of existing methods under such conditions. Therefore, we develop PruningRAG, a plug-and-play RAG framework that uses multi-granularity pruning strategies to more effectively incorporate relevant context and mitigate the negative impact of misleading information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance of PruningRAG and our insightful findings are also reported. Our dataset and code are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/USTCAGI/PruningRAG}.</description>

      <title>RDSA: A Robust Deep Graph Clustering Framework via Dual Soft Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21745v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is an essential aspect of network analysis that involves grouping nodes into separate clusters. Recent developments in deep learning have resulted in graph clustering, which has proven effective in many applications. Nonetheless, these methods often encounter difficulties when dealing with real-world graphs, particularly in the presence of noisy edges. Additionally, many denoising graph clustering methods tend to suffer from lower performance, training instability, and challenges in scaling to large datasets compared to non-denoised models. To tackle these issues, we introduce a new framework called the Robust Deep Graph Clustering Framework via Dual Soft Assignment (RDSA). RDSA consists of three key components: (i) a node embedding module that effectively integrates the graph's topological features and node attributes; (ii) a structure-based soft assignment module that improves graph modularity by utilizing an affinity matrix for node assignments; and (iii) a node-based soft assignment module that identifies community landmarks and refines node assignments to enhance the model's robustness. We assess RDSA on various real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings indicate that RDSA provides robust clustering across different graph types, excelling in clustering effectiveness and robustness, including adaptability to noise, stability, and scalability.</description>

      <title>SciPIP: An LLM-based Scientific Paper Idea Proposer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for automating the proposal of innovative scientific ideas. This process involves two key phases: literature retrieval and idea generation. However, existing approaches often fall short due to their reliance on keyword-based search tools during the retrieval phase, which neglects crucial semantic information and frequently results in incomplete retrieval outcomes. Similarly, in the idea generation phase, current methodologies tend to depend solely on the internal knowledge of LLMs or metadata from retrieved papers, thereby overlooking significant valuable insights contained within the full texts. To address these limitations, we introduce SciPIP, an innovative framework designed to enhance the LLM-based proposal of scientific ideas through improvements in both literature retrieval and idea generation. Our approach begins with the construction of a comprehensive literature database that supports advanced retrieval based not only on keywords but also on semantics and citation relationships. This is complemented by the introduction of a multi-granularity retrieval algorithm aimed at ensuring more thorough and exhaustive retrieval results. For the idea generation phase, we propose a dual-path framework that effectively integrates both the content of retrieved papers and the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs. This integration significantly boosts the novelty, feasibility, and practical value of proposed ideas. Our experiments, conducted across various domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrate SciPIP's capability to generate a multitude of innovative and useful ideas. These findings underscore SciPIP's potential as a valuable tool for researchers seeking to advance their fields with groundbreaking concepts.</description>

      <title>MIRe: Enhancing Multimodal Queries Representation via Fusion-Free Modality Interaction for Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal retrieval methods have endowed text-based retrievers with multimodal capabilities by utilizing pre-training strategies for visual-text alignment. They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Inspirational search, the process of exploring designs to inform and inspire new creative work, is pivotal in mobile user interface (UI) design. However, exploring the vast space of UI references remains a challenge. Existing AI-based UI search methods often miss crucial semantics like target users or the mood of apps. Additionally, these models typically require metadata like view hierarchies, limiting their practical use. We used a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to extract and interpret semantics from mobile UI images. We identified key UI semantics through a formative study and developed a semantic-based UI search system. Through computational and human evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing UI retrieval methods, offering UI designers a more enriched and contextually relevant search experience. We enhance the understanding of mobile UI design semantics and highlight MLLMs' potential in inspirational search, providing a rich dataset of UI semantics for future studies.</description>
