      <title>Dynamics of many-body localized systems: logarithmic lightcones and $\log \, t$-law of $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the Many-Body-Localization phenomenology we consider arbitrarily large one-dimensional spin systems. The XXZ model with disorder is a prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially localized integrals of motion (LIOMs), but assuming instead a logarithmic lightcone we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation of $ \alpha$-R\'enyi entropies, $ 0&lt; \alpha&lt;1 $ close to one, obtaining a $\log \, t$-law. Assuming the existence of LIOMs we prove that the Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bound of the system's dynamics has a logarithmic lightcone and show that the dynamical generation of the von Neumann entropy, from a generic initial product state, has for large times a $ \log \, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the dynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments in comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.</description>

      <title>Spin glass model of in-context learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention, and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and most importantly why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without training. Our theory reveals that for single instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of the in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed spin glass model thus establishes a foundation to understand the empirical success of large language models.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the lack of tractable standard models. By leveraging the maximum entropy principle in curved statistical manifolds, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks enhance memory capacity over the classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex network systems.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization crossover is sharper in quasiperiodic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to a phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the strong disorder may significantly slow down or even completely hinder the thermalization of quantum many-body systems. A sufficiently deep quasiperiodic potential may also inhibit thermalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate direct differences in the behavior of standard ergodicity-breaking indicators at the MBL crossover in random and quasiperiodic systems. Our key finding is the exponential increase in the sharpness of the MBL crossover with system size for quasiperiodic systems, a trend that is only linear in disordered systems. The strong tendency towards a non-analytic behavior in quasiperiodic systems is consistent with the existence of dynamical regimes with sharply defined boundaries or an MBL phase transition. It highlights the importance of quasiperiodic systems for our understanding of many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large time effective kinetics $\beta$-function for quantum (2+p)-spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the quantum $(2+p)$-spin dynamics of a $N$-vector $\textbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the lens of renormalization group (RG) theory. The RG is based on a coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of matrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic whose eigenvalue distribution undergoes a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. We focus our investigation on perturbation theory and vertex expansion for effective average action, which proves more amenable than standard nonperturbative approaches due to the distinct non-local temporal and replicative structures that emerge in the effective interactions following disorder integration. Our work entails the formulation of rules to address these non-localities within the framework of perturbation theory, culminating in the derivation of one-loop $\beta$-functions. Our explicit calculations focus on the cases $p=3$, $p=\infty$, and additional analytic material is given in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Operator space fragmentation in perturbed Floquet-Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p &lt; 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Topological p-wave Superconductors with Disorder and Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). % This phase may be equally realized with two quantum Ising spin chains coupled through a spin interaction along $z$ direction. In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Learning Atoms from Crystal Structure</title>

Abstract: Computational modelling of materials using machine learning, ML, and historical data has become integral to materials research. The efficiency of computational modelling is strongly affected by the choice of the numerical representation for describing the composition, structure and chemical elements. Structure controls the properties, but often only the composition of a candidate material is available. Existing elemental descriptors lack direct access to structural insights such as the coordination geometry of an element. In this study, we introduce Local Environment-induced Atomic Features, LEAFs, which incorporate information about the statistically preferred local coordination geometry for atoms in crystal structure into descriptors for chemical elements, enabling the modelling of materials solely as compositions without requiring knowledge of their crystal structure. In the crystal structure, each atomic site can be described by similarity to common local structural motifs; by aggregating these features of similarity from the experimentally verified crystal structures of inorganic materials, LEAFs formulate a set of descriptors for chemical elements and compositions. The direct connection of LEAFs to the local coordination geometry enables the analysis of ML model property predictions, linking compositions to the underlying structure-property relationships. We demonstrate the versatility of LEAFs in structure-informed property predictions for compositions, mapping of chemical space in structural terms, and prioritising elemental substitutions. Based on the latter for predicting crystal structures of binary ionic compounds, LEAFs achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of 86 per cent. These results suggest that the structurally informed description of chemical elements and compositions developed in this work can effectively guide synthetic efforts in discovering new materials.</description>

      <title>Theory of elastic constants of athermal amorphous solids with internal stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.09582v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic derivation of the elastic constants of amorphous solids is presented within the framework of nonaffine lattice dynamics, which makes use of a perturbative form of the low-frequency eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix introduced in [V. Mazzacurati, G. Ruocco, M. Sampoli EPL 34, 681 (1996)]. The theory correctly recovers the shear modulus at jamming, $\mu \sim (z-2d)$, including prefactors in quantitative agreement with simulations. Furthermore, this framework allows us, for the first time, to include the effect of internal stresses. The theory shows that the Maxwell rigidity criterion $z=2d$ is violated with internal stress. In particular, $\mu \sim (z-2df)$ where $f&lt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, stretched, and the solid is thus rigid below the Maxwell isostatic limit, while $f&gt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, compressed. The coefficient $f$ is derived in analytical form and depends only on $d$ and on the average particle displacement from the interaction energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Rapid Discovery of Graphene Nanocrystals Using DFT and Bayesian Optimization with Neural Network Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational method used to obtain physical and chemical properties of materials. In the materials discovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and high-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties. However, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to its high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian optimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart search. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network, trained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising regions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This approach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the number of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes ranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance. Using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant reduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required for a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network kernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half a day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is substantial. Our approach can be generalized to the discovery of new drugs, chemicals, crystals, and alloys with high-dimensional and large chemical spaces, offering a scalable solution for various applications in materials science.</description>

Abstract: The study of adaptive dynamics, involving many degrees of freedom on two separated timescales, one for fast changes of state variables and another for the slow adaptation of parameters controlling the former's dynamics is crucial for understanding feedback mechanisms underlying evolution and learning. We present a path-integral approach \`a la Martin-Siggia-Rose-De Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) to analyse nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmental noise, leading to phenotypic robustness.</description>

Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, dubbed fading ergodicity regime, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Thermalization propagation front and robustness against avalanches in localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the many-body localized (MBL) phase to the quantum-avalanche instability by studying the dynamics of a localized spin chain coupled to a $T=\infty$ thermal bath through its leftmost site. By analyzing local magnetizations, we estimate the size of the thermalized sector of the chain and find that it increases logarithmically slowly in time. This logarithmically slow propagation of the thermalization front allows us to lower bound the slowest thermalization time, and find a broad parameter range where it scales fast enough with the system size that MBL is robust against thermalization induced by avalanches. The further finding that the imbalance -- a global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale exponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with these results.</description>
