      <title>Distributed Lyapunov Functions for Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear networks are often multistable, exhibiting coexisting stable states with competing regions of attraction (ROAs). As a result, ROAs can have complex "tentacle-like" morphologies that are challenging to characterize analytically or computationally. In addition, the high dimensionality of the state space prohibits the automated construction of Lyapunov functions using state-of-the-art optimization methods, such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming. In this letter, we propose a distributed approach for the construction of Lyapunov functions based solely on local information. To this end, we establish an augmented comparison lemma that characterizes the existence conditions of partial Lyapunov functions, while also accounting for residual effects caused by the associated dimensionality reduction. These theoretical results allow us to formulate an SOS optimization that iteratively constructs such partial functions, whose aggregation forms a composite Lyapunov function. The resulting composite function provides accurate convex approximations of both the volumes and shapes of the ROAs. We validate our method on networks of van der Pol and Ising oscillators, demonstrating its effectiveness in characterizing high-dimensional systems with non-convex ROAs.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Hybrid Approach for Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a key challenge in hybrid data-driven predictive control: the effect of measurement noise on Hankel matrices. While noise is handled in direct and indirect methods, hybrid approaches often overlook its impact during trajectory estimation. We propose a Noise-Tolerant Data-Driven Predictive Control (NTDPC) framework that integrates singular value decomposition to separate system dynamics from noise within reduced-order Hankel matrices. This enables accurate prediction with shorter data horizons and lower computational effort. A sensitivity index is introduced to support horizon selection under different noise levels. Simulation results indicate improved robustness and efficiency compared to existing hybrid methods.</description>

      <title>DPLib: A Standard Benchmark Library for Distributed Power System Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{DPLib} is an open-source MATLAB-based benchmark library created to support research and development in distributed and decentralized power system analysis and optimization. Distributed and decentralized methods offer scalability, privacy preservation, and resilience to single points of failure, making them increasingly important for modern power systems. However, unlike centralized tools such as MATPOWER, no general-purpose, reproducible data library package currently exists for distributed power system studies. DPLib fills this gap by providing a standard power system library featuring over 20 multi-region benchmark test cases of varying sizes, along with a graph-based partitioning toolkit that decomposes any MATPOWER test system into multiple electrically coherent regions. The partitioning toolkit, an easy-to-use MATLAB code, generates standardized \texttt{.mat} and \texttt{.m} files, along with region visualizations for intuitive understanding. We also provide modular, easy-to-use distributed optimal power flow (OPF) solvers: an alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM)-based DC-OPF solver implemented in YALMIP, and an ADMM-based AC-OPF solver leveraging IPOPT. These solvers validate the generated test systems for distributed optimization applications. Numerical results validate the generated test cases, establishing DPLib as a foundation for reproducible distributed power system research.</description>

      <title>Resilience Through Escalation: A Graph-Based PACE Architecture for Satellite Threat Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite systems increasingly face operational risks from jamming, cyberattacks, and electromagnetic disruptions. Traditional redundancy strategies often fail against dynamic, multi-vector threats. This paper introduces a resilience-by-design framework grounded in the PACE (Primary, Alternate, Contingency, Emergency) methodology, originally developed for tactical communications in military operations, adapting it to satellite systems through a layered state-transition model informed by threat scoring frameworks such as CVSS, DREAD, and NASA's risk matrix. We define a dynamic resilience index to quantify system adaptability and implement three PACE variants: static, adaptive, and softmax-based decision models, to evaluate resilience under diverse disruption scenarios. The proposed approach highlights the effectiveness of lightweight, decision-aware fallback mechanisms in improving survivability and operational continuity for next-generation space assets.</description>

      <title>Optimal Parameter Design for Power Electronic Converters Using a Probabilistic Learning-Based Stochastic Surrogate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selection of optimal design for power electronic converter parameters involves balancing efficiency and thermal constraints to ensure high performance without compromising safety. This paper introduces a probabilistic-learning-based stochastic surrogate modeling framework to address this challenge and significantly reduce the time required during the design phase. The approach begins with a neural network classifier that evaluates the feasibility of parameter configurations, effectively filtering out unsafe and/or impractical inputs. Subsequently, a probabilistic prediction model estimates the converter's efficiency and temperature while quantifying prediction uncertainty, providing both performance insights and reliability metrics. Finally, a heuristic optimization-based model is employed to optimize a multi-objective function that maximizes efficiency while adhering to thermal constraints. The optimization process incorporates penalty terms to discourage solutions that violate practical thresholds, ensuring actionable and realistic recommendations. An advanced heuristic optimization method is used to find the optimal solution and is compared with several well-known search algorithms, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu-Search (TS), and Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC). The results demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy and optimization outcomes, offering a robust solution for advancing power electronics design.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Control of Autonomous Vehicles for Traffic Density Reduction at a Signalized Junction: An MPC Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective and safe management of traffic is a key issue due to the rapid advancement of the urban transportation system. Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) possess the capability to connect with each other and adjacent infrastructure, presenting novel opportunities for enhancing traffic flow and coordination. This work proposes a dual-mode model predictive control (MPC) architecture that tackles two interrelated issues: mitigating traffic density at signalized junctions and facilitating seamless, cooperative lane changes in high-density traffic conditions. The objective of this work is to facilitate responsive decision-making for CAVs, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of urban mobility. Moreover, we ensure recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed MPC scheme by the integration of an online-calculated maximal control invariant terminal set. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Estimating Technical Loss without Power Flows: A Practical, Data-Driven Approach for Loss Estimation in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric grids in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) across the world face an acute challenge. To support global decarbonisation efforts and raise millions from energy poverty, these grids must shoulder substantial load growth while integrating distributed renewable generation. However, decades of rapid and poorly funded infrastructure expansions have led to national grids in many LMICs that are strained and weak, composed of aging, faulty, and undersized infrastructure. A cause and symptom of this weakness is excessive technical loss within the grid infrastructure during energy delivery, particularly at the distribution level; network losses are regularly estimated to be well over 20 percent, compared to a baseline of 5 percent in higher-income nations. Addressing technical loss through targeted interventions is essential for bolstering grids' physical and economic strength. Unfortunately, current approaches for estimating and localizing technical loss require expensive, extensive power flow sensing, which is essentially absent in LMIC distribution systems. We present a novel approach to technical loss estimation without power flows, which leverages more readily available voltage magnitude measurements at sparse locations in the grid. This estimator puts loss estimation and localization within reach for LMIC grids globally, and provides a critical tool for the effective design, implementation, and evaluation of loss-reduction interventions.</description>

      <title>Joint Scheduling of DER under Demand Charges: Structure and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint scheduling of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, renewable generation, and battery energy storage systems, under net energy metering frameworks with demand charges. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic program aimed at maximizing expected operational surplus while accounting for renewable generation uncertainty. We analytically characterize the structure of the optimal control policy and show that it admits a threshold-based form. However, due to the strong temporal coupling of the storage and demand charge constraints, the number of conditional branches in the policy scales combinatorially with the scheduling horizon, as it requires a look-ahead over future states. To overcome the high computational complexity in the general formulation, an efficient approximation algorithm is proposed, which searches for the peak demand under a mildly relaxed problem. We show that the algorithm scales linearly with the scheduling horizon. Extensive simulations using two open-source datasets validate the proposed algorithm and compare its performance against different DER control strategies, including a reinforcement learning-based one. Under varying storage and tariff parameters, the results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmarks in achieving a relatively small solution gap compared to the theoretical upper bound.</description>

      <title>Structural System Identification via Validation and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the governing equation parameter values is essential for integrating experimental data with scientific theory to understand, validate, and predict the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we propose a new method for structural system identification (SI), uncertainty quantification, and validation directly from data. Inspired by generative modeling frameworks, a neural network maps random noise to physically meaningful parameters. These parameters are then used in the known equation of motion to obtain fake accelerations, which are compared to real training data via a mean square error loss. To simultaneously validate the learned parameters, we use independent validation datasets. The generated accelerations from these datasets are evaluated by a discriminator network, which determines whether the output is real or fake, and guides the parameter-generator network. Analytical and real experiments show the parameter estimation accuracy and model validation for different nonlinear structural systems.</description>

Abstract: The extended and unscented Kalman filter, and the particle filter provide a robust framework for fault-tolerant attitude estimation on spacecraft. This paper explores how each filter performs for a large satellite in a low earth orbit. Additionally, various techniques, built on these filters, for fault detection, isolation and recovery from erroneous sensor measurements, are analyzed.

      <title>Estimation of superconducting cavity bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabled by progress in superconducting technology, several continuous wave linear accelerators are foreseen in the next decade. For these machines, it is of crucial importance to track the main cavity parameters, such as the resonator bandwidth and detuning. The bandwidth yields information on the superconducting state of the cavity. The detuning should be minimized to limit the required power to operate the cavity. The estimation of these parameters is commonly implemented in the digital electronics of the Low-Level RF control system to minimize the computation delay. In this proceeding, we present a way to compute the bandwidth and detuning using a Luenberger observer. In contrast to previous methods, a state observer yields estimations at the native control system sample rate without explicitly filtering the input signals. Additionally, the error convergence properties of the estimations can be controlled intuitively by adjusting gain parameters. Implementation considerations and test results on the derived observer are presented in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Exact Time-Varying Turnpikes for Dynamic Operation of District Heating Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: District heating networks (DHNs) are crucial for decarbonizing the heating sector. Yet, their efficient and reliable operation requires the coordination of multiple heat producers and the consideration of future demands. Predictive and optimization-based control is commonly used to address this task, but existing results for DHNs do not account for time-varying problem aspects. Since the turnpike phenomenon can serve as a basis for model predictive control design and analysis, this paper examines its role in DHN optimization by analyzing the underlying optimal control problem with time-varying prices and demands. That is, we derive conditions for the existence of a unique time-varying singular arc, which constitutes the time varying turnpike, and we provide its closed-form expression. Additionally, we present converse turnpike results showing a exact time-varying case implies strict dissipativity of the optimal control problem. A numerical example illustrates our findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Plasmonically Enhanced Flexural-Mode AlScN Nanoplate Resonator as Uncooled and Ultrafast IR Detector with High Responsivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel class of miniaturized, uncooled, and ultra-fast infrared (IR) resonant thermal detectors (RTDs) based on 30%-doped Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) nanoplates. Exploiting high electromechanical coupling, good thermal properties, and enhanced and selective IR absorption, the presented device aims to demonstrate significant advancements over the state-of-the-art IR RTDs. This single pixel combines compact footprint, high spectral selectivity and responsivity, reduced noise, and fast thermal response, allowing for the potential development of innovative IR thermal imagers through multi-pixel integration. The flexural nature of the actuated resonance mode eventually enables an interferometric optical readout, paving the way towards achieving extremely low Noise Equivalent Power levels. These results demonstrate a high IR responsivity of around 130 ppt/pW, a thermal time constant of around 330 us, and a large out-of-plane displacement. This work represents the first experimental integration on a resonating platform of plasmonic absorbers that utilize AlScN as dielectric layer.</description>

      <title>Towards an Optimal Control Perspective of ResNet Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a training formulation for ResNets reflecting an optimal control problem that is applicable for standard architectures and general loss functions. We suggest bridging both worlds via penalizing intermediate outputs of hidden states corresponding to stage cost terms in optimal control. For standard ResNets, we obtain intermediate outputs by propagating the state through the subsequent skip connections and the output layer. We demonstrate that our training dynamic biases the weights of the unnecessary deeper residual layers to vanish. This indicates the potential for a theory-grounded layer pruning strategy.</description>

      <title>Controller Adaptation via Learning Solutions of Contextual Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework for adapting the controller's parameters based on learning optimal solutions from contextual black-box optimization problems. We consider a class of control design problems for dynamical systems operating in different environments or conditions represented by contextual parameters. The overarching goal is to identify the controller parameters that maximize the controlled system's performance, given different realizations of the contextual parameters.We formulate a contextual Bayesian optimization problem in which the solution is actively learned using Gaussian processes to approximate the controller adaptation strategy. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework with a sim-to-real example. We learn the optimal weighting strategy of a model predictive control for connected and automated vehicles interacting with human-driven vehicles from simulations and then deploy it in a real-time experiment.</description>

      <title>A Review of Safe Reinforcement Learning Methods for Modern Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the availability of more comprehensive measurement data in modern power systems, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant interest in operation and control. Conventional RL relies on trial-and-error interactions with the environment and reward feedback, which often leads to exploring unsafe operating regions and executing unsafe actions, especially when deployed in real-world power systems. To address these challenges, safe RL has been proposed to optimize operational objectives while ensuring safety constraints are met, keeping actions and states within safe regions throughout both training and deployment. Rather than relying solely on manually designed penalty terms for unsafe actions, as is common in conventional RL, safe RL methods reviewed here primarily leverage advanced and proactive mechanisms. These include techniques such as Lagrangian relaxation, safety layers, and theoretical guarantees like Lyapunov functions to rigorously enforce safety boundaries. This paper provides a comprehensive review of safe RL methods and their applications across various power system operations and control domains, including security control, real-time operation, operational planning, and emerging areas. It summarizes existing safe RL techniques, evaluates their performance, analyzes suitable deployment scenarios, and examines algorithm benchmarks and application environments. The paper also highlights real-world implementation cases and identifies critical challenges such as scalability in large-scale systems and robustness under uncertainty, providing potential solutions and outlining future directions to advance the reliable integration and deployment of safe RL in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Event-Triggered NMPC for Efficient 6G Communications: Experimental Results and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networked control systems enable real-time control and coordination of distributed systems, leveraging the low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity offered by 5G and future 6G networks. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and smart grids. Despite networked control algorithms admitting nominal stability guarantees even in the presence of delays and packet dropouts, their practical performance still heavily depends on the specific characteristics and conditions of the underlying network. To achieve the desired performance while efficiently using communication resources, co-design of control and communication is pivotal. Although periodic schemes, where communication instances are fixed, can provide reliable control performance, unnecessary transmissions, when updates are not needed, result in inefficient usage of network resources. In this paper, we investigate the potential for co-design of model predictive control and network communication. To this end, we design and implement an event-triggered nonlinear model predictive controller for stabilizing a Furuta pendulum communicating over a tailored open radio access network 6G research platform. We analyze the control performance as well as network utilization under varying channel conditions and event-triggering criteria. Additionally, we analyze the network-induced delay pattern and its interaction with the event-triggered controller. Our results show that the event-triggered control scheme achieves similar performance to periodic control with reduced communication demand.</description>

      <title>Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in water distribution networks (WDNs), with a focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements (SP) that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a greedy algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic systems and observability theory, and yields SPs that are submodular and robust to hydraulic changes. Case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Load Altering Attacks on Load Frequency Control through Python and RTDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.</description>

      <title>A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Balanced Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal infrastructure requirements make LoRa suitable for service delivery in remote areas. Additionally, web applications have become a de-facto standard for modern service delivery. However, Long Range (LoRa) fails to enable HTTP access due to its limited bandwidth, payload size limitations, and high collisions in multi-user setups. We propose LoRaConnect to enable HTTP access over LoRa. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which client devices connect and access HTTP resources over LoRa backhaul. It implements caching and synchronization mechanisms to address LoRa's aforementioned limitations. It also implements a message-slicing method in the application layer to overcome LoRa's payload limitations. We evaluate the proposed system using actual hardware in three experimental setups to assess the baseline performance, ideal scenario, and practical application scenario with Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS). Additionally, it implements a ping operation to demonstrate Internet capability and extensible nature. LoRaWeb achieves an average throughput of 1.18 KB/S approximately, with an access delay of only 1.3 S approximately for a 1.5KB webpage in the baseline setup. Moreover, it achieves an access delay of approximately 6.7 S for a 10KB webpage in the ideal case and an average end-to-end delay of only 612 ms approximately in the FHSS-based setup. Comparison with benchmark suggests multi-fold improvement.</description>

      <title>One Model to Forecast Them All and in Entity Distributions Bind Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting in power systems often involves multi-entity datasets like households, feeders, and wind turbines, where generating reliable entity-specific forecasts presents significant challenges. Traditional approaches require training individual models for each entity, making them inefficient and hard to scale. This study addresses this problem using GUIDE-VAE, a conditional variational autoencoder that allows entity-specific probabilistic forecasting using a single model. GUIDE-VAE provides flexible outputs, ranging from interpretable point estimates to full probability distributions, thanks to its advanced covariance composition structure. These distributions capture uncertainty and temporal dependencies, offering richer insights than traditional methods. To evaluate our GUIDE-VAE-based forecaster, we use household electricity consumption data as a case study due to its multi-entity and highly stochastic nature. Experimental results demonstrate that GUIDE-VAE outperforms conventional quantile regression techniques across key metrics while ensuring scalability and versatility. These features make GUIDE-VAE a powerful and generalizable tool for probabilistic forecasting tasks, with potential applications beyond household electricity consumption.</description>

      <title>Latent Diffusion Model Based Denoising Receiver for 6G Semantic Communication: From Stochastic Differential Theory to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, to enhance the robustness against both channel noise and transmission data distribution shifts. A theoretical foundation is established using stochastic differential equations (SDEs), from which a closed-form mapping between any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the optimal denoising timestep is derived. Moreover, to address distribution mismatch, a mathematical scaling method is introduced to align received semantic features with the training distribution of the GAI. Built on this theoretical foundation, a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based semantic communication framework is proposed that combines a variational autoencoder for semantic features extraction, where a pretrained diffusion model is used for denoising. The proposed system is a training-free framework that supports zero-shot generalization, and achieves superior performance under low-SNR and out-of-distribution conditions, offering a scalable and robust solution for future 6G semantic communication systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semantic communication framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and semantic perceptual quality, consistently outperforming baselines across a wide range of SNRs and data distributions without any fine-tuning or post-training.</description>
