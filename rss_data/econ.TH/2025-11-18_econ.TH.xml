      <title>Peace Talk and Conflict Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Costly pre-play messages can deter unnecessary wars - but the same messages can also entrench stalemates once violence begins. We develop an overlapping-generations model of a security dilemma with persistent group types (normal vs bad), one-sided private signaling by the current old to the current young, and noisy private memory of the last encounter. We characterize a stationary equilibrium in which, for an intermediate band of signal costs, normal old agents mix on sending a costly reassurance only after an alarming private history; the signal is kept marginally persuasive by endogenous receiver cutoffs and strategic mimicking by bad types. Signaling strictly reduces the hazard of conflict onset; conditional on onset, duration is unchanged in the private model but increases once a small probability of publicity (leaks) creates a public record of failed reconciliation. With publicity, play generically absorbs in a peace trap or a conflict trap. We discuss welfare and policy: when to prefer back-channels versus public pledges.</description>

      <title>Collusion-proof Auction Design using Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of auction design in the presence of bidder collusion. Specifically, we consider a multi-unit auction of identical items with single-minded bidders, where a subset of bidders may collude by coordinating bids and transferring payments and items among themselves. While the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism achieves efficient and truthful outcomes, it is highly vulnerable to collusion. In contrast, fully collusion-proof mechanisms are limited to posted-price formats, which fail to guarantee even approximate efficiency. This paper aims to bridge this gap by designing auctions that achieve good welfare and revenue guarantees even when some bidders collude. We first characterize the strategic behavior of colluding bidders under VCG and prove that such bidders optimally bid shade: they never overbid or take additional items, but instead reduce the auction price. This characterization enables a Bulow-Klemperer type result: adding colluding bidders can only improve welfare and revenue relative to running VCG on the non-colluding group alone. We then propose a Hybrid VCG (H-VCG) mechanism that combines VCG applied to non-colluding bidders with a posted-price mechanism for colluding bidders, assuming access to a black-box collusion detection algorithm. We show that H-VCG is ex-post dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) and derive probabilistic guarantees on expected welfare and revenue under both known and unknown valuation distributions. Numerical experiments across several distributions demonstrate that H-VCG consistently outperforms VCG restricted to non-colluding bidders and approaches the performance of the ideal VCG mechanism assuming universal truthfulness. Our results provide a principled framework for incorporating collusion detection into mechanism design, offering a step toward collusion-resistant auctions.</description>

      <title>Learning by Doing: The Case of Online Lending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online lending, a phenomenon which is becoming mainstream due to the migration of consumer finance to the Internet and the adoption of AI based lending models, is an example of learning by doing. This paper studies optimal policies for a direct online lender. This is an instance of a more general problem: how should a decision-maker experiment sequentially in the face of unknown customer (or other) information? Conventional wisdom suggests the decision-maker should take advantage of sequential learning opportunities by conducting multiple small, lean experiments, each building incrementally on the results of earlier ones. Can a single grand experiment, uninformed by earlier experiments, do as well? We find that lean incremental experiments are optimal when the interest rate is exogenous. However, when we extend the lender's action space to setting both the interest rate and the loan amount, we find conditions under which a single grand experiment is optimal. In both cases, income variability can benefit the lender by enabling more effective experimentation. We also study the consumer segmentation associated with each strategy and show that the lender cannot achieve more than half the profit obtained under perfect information.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Quality in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamic reputation in a social-learning environment where only purchase decisions are observable. A long-lived seller posts a fixed price and chooses costly product quality in each period before interacting with short-lived buyers who observe past purchases but not past consumption outcomes, and receive private signals about current quality. We embed this environment in a standard type-based reputation model with a small probability of a commitment type and characterize Markov equilibria. The belief space partitions into pessimistic and optimistic cascades and an interior learning region. In cascades the seller never invests in quality, while in the learning region equilibrium investment is inverse-U in reputation: quality is highest at intermediate beliefs and lowest at the extremes. This produces early-resolution and double-hump patterns for the evolution of beliefs and quality. When quality is endogenous, higher private signal precision can shrink the effective investment region and reduce equilibrium quality. Allowing flexible pricing or public disclosure of outcomes expands the region in which the seller invests, accelerates learning, and raises welfare.</description>

      <title>Choice Paralysis in Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finite-strategy approximations of infinite-strategy evolutionary games. We prove that such approximations converge to the true dynamics over finite-time intervals, under mild regularity conditions which are satisfied by classical examples, e.g., the replicator dynamics. We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary games: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is shown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of finite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true infinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how choice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting "stuck," even though every finite approximation converges to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A Note on Qualified Majority Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes every qualified majority voting rule with a quota $q$ strictly greater than half of the voter set in environments with just two alternatives through anonymity, responsiveness, and $q$-neutrality. Crucially, the latter imposes independence of the labels of the alternatives only for all preference profiles in which some alternative is strictly top-ranked by at least $q$ voters. Thus, this paper generalizes May's (1952, Theorem, p. 682) characterization of the simple majority voting rule to qualified majority voting rules with a quota $q$ strictly greater than half of the voter set. In doing so, it shows that these qualified majority voting rules are distinguished by their degree of neutrality.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Separable Costs and Menu Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an agent with a rationally inattentive preference over menus of acts, as in de Oliveira et al (2017). We show that two axioms, Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives and Ignorance Equivalence, are necessary and sufficient for this agent to have a posterior-separable cost satisfying a mild smoothness condition, called joint-directional differentiability. Viewing the decision-maker's problem as a Bayesian persuasion problem, we also show that these axioms are necessary and sufficient for solvability by a unique hyperplane. When the cost function remains invariant for different priors, we show that these axioms imply uniformly posterior separable costs that are differentiable.</description>

      <title>Multi-District School Choice: Playing on Several Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the seminal model of Pathak and S\"onmez (2008) to a setting with multiple school districts, each running its own separate centralized match, and focus on the case of two districts. In our setting, in addition to each student being either sincere or sophisticated, she is also either constrained - able to apply only to schools within her own district of residence - or unconstrained - able to choose any single district within which to apply. We show that several key results from Pathak and S\"onmez (2008) qualitatively flip: A sophisticated student may prefer for a sincere student to become sophisticated, and a sophisticated student may prefer for her own district to use Deferred Acceptance over the Boston Mechanism, irrespective of the mechanism used by the other district. We furthermore investigate the preferences of students over the constraint levels of other students. Many of these phenomena appear abundantly in large random markets.</description>
