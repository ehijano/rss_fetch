      <title>Astrometry, orbit determination, and thermal inertia of the Tianwen-2 target asteroid (469219) Kamo`oalewa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. (469219) Kamo`oalewa is a small near-Earth asteroid, which is currently a quasi-satellite of the Earth. Lightcurve measurements also reveal a rotation period of only about 30 minutes. This asteroid has been selected as the target of the Tianwen-2 sample-return mission of the China National Space Administration.
  Aims. The first goal of this paper is to observe and improve the orbit determination of (469219) Kamo`oalewa, and better determine the Yarkovsky effect acting on it. The second goal is to estimate the thermal inertia of the asteroid, taking advantage of an improved Yarkovsky effect determination.
  Methods. Our observational campaign imaged the asteroid from the Loiano Astronomical Station and from the Calar Alto Observatory, in March 2024. We also accurately re-measured a precovery detection from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from 2004. New astrometry was later used in a 7-dimensional orbit determination, aimed at estimating both the orbital elements and the Yarkovsky effect. Thermal inertia is later studied by using the ASTERIA, a new method that is suitable to estimate thermal inertia of small asteroids.
  Results. We detected a semi-major axis drift of $(-67.35 \pm 4.70) \times 10^{-4}$ au My$^{-1}$ due to the Yarkovsky effect, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 14. The new orbit solution also significantly reduced the position uncertainty for the arrival of the Tianwen-2 spacecraft. By using different models for the physical parameters of Kamo`oalewa, the ASTERIA model estimated the thermal inertia at $\Gamma = 150^{+90}_{-45}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$ or $\Gamma = 181^{+95}_{-60}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Introduction to magnetic star-planet interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between planets and their host stars is governed by the forces of gravity, radiation, and magnetic fields. For planets orbiting their stars at distances of approximately 10 stellar radii or less, these effects are significantly intensified. Such interactions can be investigated through a combination of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies spanning wavelengths from X-rays to radio frequencies. When a hot planet resides within the star's sub-Alfv\'enic radius, magnetic star-planet interactions (SPI) become possible, often observable as stellar activity enhancements influenced by the planet's orbital motion rather than stellar rotation alone. Such interactions offer a unique perspective on the atmospheric erosion and magnetospheric characteristics of close-in exoplanets.The behavior and impacts of these magnetic interactions are highly sensitive to the magnetic fields of both the planet and its host star. This interplay can influence the magnetic activity of both bodies and has implications for the planet's irradiation levels, orbital migration, and the star's rotational dynamics. By employing phase-resolved observational methods on an expanding sample of hot Jupiter (HJ) systems, researchers can now extend these studies to other compact star-planet systems, including smaller planets in the habitable zones of M dwarfs. Efforts to comprehend magnetic SPI have led to extensive advancements in theoretical research and computational modeling. These efforts include investigations into the space weather environments of close-in giant exoplanets. Utilizing hydrodynamical (HD) and magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, researchers aim to provide both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of SPI. In this chapter, we first review notable SPI detections before summarizing the current understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms driving SPI.</description>

      <title>The Venusian Chronicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus' atmosphere -- specifically its clouds buoyed up 40 to 60 km above the surface -- has long been suspected to encompass a biosphere where Earth-like living organisms could grow and flourish. This idea has been recently rekindled by the observation (signal-to-noise ratio of about 15$\sigma$) of a phosphine (PH$_3$) absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. There is a chance that this observation could be a sign of life, because the PH$_3$ gas observed on Earth originates mostly in decaying organic material. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is no other natural process on Venus that could otherwise produce the observed PH$_3$ absorption line. On the other hand, cosmic rays and the particle cascades they produce in the Earth's atmosphere are hazardous to living organisms, because the ionizing radiation produced in air showers can blow apart chemical molecules and disrupt biochemical processes, causing cells to die or undergo dangerous mutations. Compared to Earth, the hypothesized biosphere of Venus could be exposed to substantially more ionizing radiation. This is because Venus has no protective intrinsic magnetic field, orbits closer to the Sun, and the entire eventual habitable region lies in the clouds high in the atmosphere. Thereby, if the clouds were sterilized there would be no reservoir of deeper life that can recolonize afterwards. In this communication we study the effects of particle cascades in the venusian atmosphere using the AIRES simulation package properly configured. We show that the effects of cosmic radiation in the habitable zone would be comparable to those on the Earth's surface and so would not have any hazardous effect on possible venusian microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Prediction for close approaches with terrestrial planets of asteroids from the main belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), a special subset of Near-Earth Objects, are both dangerous and scientifically valuable. PHAs that truly undergo close approaches with the Earth (dubbed CAPHAs) are of particular interest and extensively studied. The concept and study of CAPHA can be extended to other Solar system planets, which have significant implications for future planet-based observations and explorations. In this work, we conduct numerical simulations that incorporate the Yarkovsky effect to study the transformation of main belt asteroids into CAPHAs of terrestrial planets, using precise nominal timesteps, especially to ensure the reliability of the results for Mercury and Venus. Our simulations predict a total of 1893 Mercury-CAPHAs, 3014 Venus-CAPHAs, 3791 Earth-CAPHAs and 18066 Mars-CAPHAs, with an occurrence frequency of about 1, 9, 15 and 66 per year, respectively. The values for Mars-CAPHAs are consistent with our previous work, which were based on simulations with a larger nominal timestep. The predicted occurrence frequency and velocity distribution of Earth-CAPHAs are in reasonable agreement with the observed population of Earth-CAPHAs. We also find that certain asteroids can be caught in close approach with different planets at different times, raising an interesting possibility of using them as transportation between terrestrial planets in the future.</description>

      <title>HCN and C2H2 in the atmosphere of a T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Examining the Potential for Methyl Halide Accumulation and Detectability in Possible Hycean-Type Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some sub-Neptune planets may host habitable conditions; for example "Hycean" worlds with H2 envelopes over liquid water oceans can maintain potentially hospitable pressures and temperatures at their surface. Recent JWST observations of K2-18b and TOI-270d have shown that such worlds could be compelling targets for biosignature searches, given their extended scale heights and therefore large atmospheric signatures. Methylated biosignatures, a broad group of gases that can be generated by biological attachment of a CH3 group to an environmental substrate, have been proposed as candidate signs of life for Earth-like exoplanets. However, methyl halides (CH3 + halogen) have not yet been robustly examined with self-consistent photochemical and spectral models for planets with H2-dominated atmospheres. Here we demonstrate that methyl chloride (CH3Cl), predominantly produced by marine microbes, could be detected using JWST in tens of transits or fewer for Hycean planets, comparable to detection requirements for other potential atmospheric biosignatures. The threshold atmospheric mixing ratio for detectability is $\sim$10 ppm, which can accumulate with global fluxes comparable to moderately productive local environments on Earth.</description>

      <title>The T16 Project: Image Subtraction Light Curves from TESS Cycle 1 Full-Frame Images for Stars with T &lt; 16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 83,717,159 light curves for 56,401,549 stars with T &lt; 16 mag observed in the Full-Frame Images (FFIs) of Cycle 1 of the NASA TESS mission. These light curves were extracted from subtracted images produced by the Cluster Difference Imaging Survey (CDIPS; Bouma et al. 2019). We make public the raw image subtraction light curves, together with light curves detrended against instrumental systematics. We compare the light curves to other publicly available light curves from the TESS FFIs, finding that for a substantial fraction of stars with T &lt; 16, the T16 project provides the highest precision FFI light curves available. We demonstrate that the detrended T16 light curves are generally as good as, or better than, the light curves from other projects for the known TOIs. We also show that the un-detrended light curves can be used to study high amplitude variable stars. The light curves are being made available through the NASA Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). Light curve production is underway for additional TESS Cycles.</description>

      <title>Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high-resolution observations and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a general machine-learning methodology designed to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) according to their potential to contain biosignatures or bioindicators. To achieve this, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra (including stellar contamination) as containing methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained using $\sim10^7$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, generated with the package MultiREx. The trained algorithms correctly classified most of the test planets with transmission spectra having an SNR as low as 4, containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra, based on the current Earth's atmosphere, indicate that some of our models would classify most inhabited terrestrial planets observed with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs at distances similar to or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e as likely to contain bioindicators, using 4 to 10 transits. These results have significant implications for the design of observing programs and future campaigns. Machine-assisted strategies, such as the one presented here, could greatly optimize the use of JWST resources for biosignature and bioindicator searches, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery through dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Beta Pictoris planetary system and possibility of an additional planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\beta$ Pictoris system is characterized by a dusty debris disk, in addition to the presence of two already known planets. This makes it a particularly interesting case for studying the formation and evolution of planetary systems at a stage where giant planets have already formed, most of the protoplanetary gas has dissipated, and terrestrial planets could emerge. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of additional planets orbiting beyond the outermost known one, $\beta$ Pic b. More specifically, we aim to assess whether additional planets in the system could explain the discrepancy between the predicted cutoff of the disk inner cavity at $\sim$28 au with only two planets, and the observed one at $\sim$50 au. We performed an exhaustive dynamical modeling of the debris disk and the carving of its inner edge, by introducing one or two additional planets beyond $\beta$ Pic b, coplanar with the disk. Guided by theoretical predictions for the parameter space - mass, semi-major axis, eccentricity - allowed for additional planets, we further carried out a set of N-body simulations, using the symplectic integrator RMVS3. Our simulations indicate that an additional planet with a low eccentricity of 0.05, a mass between 0.15 and 1 $M_{Jup}$, and a semi-major axis between 30 and 36 au, would be consistent with the observations of an inner debris disk edge at 50 au. We have also explored the hypotheses of a higher eccentricity and the presence of two additional lower mass planets instead of one, which could also account for these observations. While we find that one or even two additional planets could explain the observed location of the disk inner edge, these hypothetical planets remain in most cases below the current observational limits of high contrast imaging. Future observational campaigns with improved sensitivity will help lowering these limits and perhaps detect that planet.</description>

      <title>Architecture Classification for Extrasolar Planetary Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a classification framework for the architectures of planetary systems based on a complete survey of the confirmed exoplanet population. With nearly 6000 confirmed exoplanets discovered, including more than 300 multiplanet systems with three or more planets, the current observational sample has reached the point where it is both feasible and useful to build a classification system that divides the observed population into meaningful categories. This framework provides a criterion to split planetary systems into inner and outer regimes, and then further divides inner systems into dynamical classes. The resulting categories include "peas-in-a-pod systems" with uniformly small planets and "warm Jupiter systems" with a mix of large and small planets, as well as "closely-spaced systems" and "gapped systems," with further subdivisions based on the locations of gaps and other features. These categories can classify nearly all of the confirmed systems with three or more planets with minimal ambiguity. We qualitatively examine the relative prevalence of each type of system, subject to observational selection effects, as well as other notable features such as the presence of hot Jupiters. A small number of outlier systems are also discussed. Potential additional classes of systems yet to be discovered are proposed.</description>

      <title>Magnetic disk winds in protoplanetary disks: Description of the model and impact on global disk evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canonically, a protoplanetary disk is thought to undergo (gravito-)viscous evolution, wherein the angular momentum of the accreting material is transported outwards. However, several lines of reasoning suggest that the turbulent viscosity in a typical protoplanetary disk is insufficient to drive the observed accretion rates. An emerging paradigm suggests that radially extended magnetic disk winds may play a crucial role in the disk evolution. We propose a global model of magnetic wind-driven accretion for evolution of protoplanetary disks, based on the insights gained from local shearing box simulations. Here we develop this model and constrain its parameters with the help of theoretical expectations and comparison with observations. The magnetic wind is characterized with the associated loss of angular momentum and mass, which depend on the local disk conditions and stellar properties. We incorporate the disk winds self-consistently in the code FEOSAD and study formation and long-term evolution of protoplanetary disks. We include disk self-gravity and an adaptive turbulent alpha, while the co-evolution of dust is also considered. Synthetic observations are obtained via radiation thermo-chemical code ProDiMo. The models with inclusion of disk winds satisfy general expectations from both theory and observations. The disk wind parameters can be guided by observational constraints and the synthetic observations resulting from such a model compare favorably with the selected ALMA survey data of Class II disks. The proposed magnetic disk wind model is a significant step forward in the direction of representing a more complete disk evolution, wherein the disk experiences concurrent torques from viscous, gravitational, and magnetic wind processes.</description>

Abstract: Expanding the number of hot giant planets with atmospheric characterisation can improve our understanding of their atmospheres as well as their formation and evolution mechanisms. In this work, we use high-resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared (NIR) to search for chemical signatures in the atmosphere of the two hot Jupiters KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab, and perform a first characterisation of their atmospheric properties. We measured the transmission spectrum of each target with the NIR high-resolution spectrograph GIANO-B at the TNG and searched for atmospheric signals by cross-correlating the data with synthetic transmission spectra. In order to characterise the chemical-physical properties of the two atmospheres, we ran two different atmospheric retrievals for each dataset: a retrieval assuming chemical equilibrium and a `free-chemistry' retrieval, in which the abundance of each molecule could vary freely. We detect H$_2$O in the atmospheres of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab with an S/N = 6.6 and S/N = 4.2, respectively. The two retrievals indicate a water-rich atmosphere for both targets. For KELT-8 b, we determine a water volume mixing ratio of log$_{10}$(VMR$_{\rm H_2O})=-2.07^{+0.53}_{-0.72}$, a metallicity of [M/H] $=0.77^{+0.61}_{-0.89}$ dex, and a sub-solar C/O ratio (C/O $\leq0.30$, at $2\,\sigma$). For KELT-23 Ab, we find log$_{10}$(VMR$_{\rm H_2O})=-2.26^{+0.75}_{-1.24}$, [M/H] $=-0.42^{+1.56}_{-1.35}$ dex, and C/O ratio $\leq0.78$ (at $2\,\sigma$). Comparing these chemical properties with those of the host stars, we suggest that, for both planets, the accretion of gaseous material occurred within the H$_2$O snowline in a pebble-rich disk enriched in oxygen due to sublimation of water ice from the inward-drifting pebbles. In conclusion, we measure the atmospheric signals of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab for the first time and place first constraints on their properties.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>

      <title>Orbital Dynamics of the Solar Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.</description>

      <title>Rate-induced biosphere collapse in the Daisyworld model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is much interest in the phenomenon of rate-induced tipping, where a system changes abruptly when forcings change faster than some critical rate. Here, we demonstrate and analyse rate-induced tipping in the classic "Daisyworld" model. The Daisyworld model considers a hypothetical planet inhabited only by two species of daisies with different reflectivities, and is notable because the daisies lead to an emergent "regulation" of the planet's temperature. The model serves as a useful thought experiment regarding the co-evolution of life and the global environment, and has been widely used in the teaching of Earth system science.
  We show that sufficiently fast changes in insolation (i.e. incoming sunlight) can cause life on Daisyworld to go extinct, even if life could in principle survive at any fixed insolation value among those encountered. Mathematically, this occurs due to the fact that the solution of the forced (nonautonomous) system crosses the stable manifold of a saddle point for the frozen (autonomous) system. The new discovery of rate-induced tipping in such a classic, simple, and well-studied model provides further supporting evidence that rate-induced tipping -- and indeed, rate-induced collapse -- may be common in a wide range of systems.</description>
