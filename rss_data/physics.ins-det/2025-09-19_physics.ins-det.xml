      <title>Intensified optical camera with Timepix4 readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

      <title>Performance evaluation of compact plastic scintillating fiber modules for muon tomography applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that exploits cosmic-ray muons from multiple directions. Its performance critically relies on stable, large-area, and high-resolution position-sensitive detectors. In this work, we report on the development of four compact scintillating fiber modules, each 100 cm long and composed of two staggered layers of 1 mm diameter fibers. The fibres are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc1A-based front-end electronics. The modules were characterised with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection efficiency above 97\% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with uniform response over different distances from the readout end. These results demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area systems in muon tomography applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of construction steels on PMTs detection efficiency at JUNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the carbon steel rebars and the steel TT bridge within the JUNO structure on the shielding effect of the coils. Our simulations demonstrate that despite the presence of carbon steel structures of the rebars of the water pool and the TT bridge within the central detector vicinity, the residual magnetic field experienced by the PMTs remains within the acceptable limit established by the JUNO experiment of 10% for CD-PMTs and 20% for Veto-PMTs, compared to the geomagnetic field. The maximum magnetic fields experienced by the CD-PMTs and Veto-PMTs are 9% and 18% of the geomagnetic field strength, respectively. These findings indicate that the residual magnetic field has minimal impacts on the PMTs detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Applying reinforcement learning to optical cavity locking tasks: considerations on actor-critic architectures and real-time hardware implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceedings contains our considerations made during and after fruitful discussions held at EuCAIFCon 2025. We explore the use of deep reinforcement learning for autonomous locking of Fabry-Perot optical cavities in non-linear regimes, with relevance to gravitational-wave detectors. A custom Gymnasium environment with a time-domain simulator enabled training of agents such as deep deterministic policy gradient, achieving reliable lock acquisition for both low- and high-finesse cavities, including Virgo-like parameters. We also discuss possible improvements with Twin Delayed DDPG, Soft Actor Critic and meta-reinforcement learning, as well as strategies for low-latency execution and off-line policy updates to address hardware limitations. These studies lay the groundwork for future deployment of reinforcement learning-based control in real optical setups.</description>

      <title>Probing the meV QCD Axion with the $\texttt{SQWARE}$ Quantum Semiconductor Haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Semiconductor-Quantum-Well Axion Radiometer Experiment ($\texttt{SQWARE}$) -- a new experimental platform for direct detection of axion dark matter in the meV mass range -- based on resonantly enhanced axion-photon conversion through the inverse Primakoff effect in engineered quantum semiconductor heterostructures. The core of the radiometer is a GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well structure forming a magnetoplasmonic cavity, containing an ultrahigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, which realizes a tunable epsilon-near-zero resonance in the terahertz frequency range. By controlling the orientation of the cavity within a strong external magnetic field, both the resonance frequency and the axion-induced current are optimized $\textit{in situ}$, enabling efficient scanning across a broad mass range without complex mechanical adjustment. The axion-induced electromagnetic signal radiatively emitted from the magnetoplasmonic cavity is detected by a state-of-the-art photodetector. We present the theoretical basis for resonant enhancement, detail the experimental design and benchmarks through extensive simulations, and project the sensitivity of $\texttt{SQWARE}$ for several realistic configurations. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{SQWARE}$ can probe the well-motivated quantum chromodynamics axion parameter space and close a critical gap in direct searches at meV masses.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Walk in Fast Timing: The Role of Dual Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preparation for HL-LHC operation, a number of new detector systems are being constructed with timing precision on physics objects of $\leq50$ picoseconds. These time stamps will reduce the level of pileup induced backgrounds as the number of interactions per crossing will reach of order 100-200\cite{Shiltsev}.
  In this report we note that this high pileup level will necessitate a new approach to calibration of these large timing arrays (typically with several $\times10^5$ channels) . Since the usual tools required for walk correction (a single t$_{0}$ reference and tracking) may not be readily available on Day-1, an initial calibration technique using only data internal to the timing array would be a benefit.
  We demonstrate that enhancing the usual pair of timing ASIC data (ie threshold time and amplitude or time-over-threshold) with a 2nd threshold time greatly simplifies the analysis of amplitude walk. Walk dependence on the slope at threshold (derived from the two thresholds) is quite generally given by a single linear expression. Furthermore the Amplitude Walk Coefficient (AWC) can usually be determined in advance, as we will show.
  While this technique results in calibration precision equivalent to the familiar brute force technique it should be emphasized that it is applicable when the tools required for the latter technique are not available.</description>

      <title>Efficient cosmic ray generator for particle detector simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional cosmic ray simulations make use of the Montecarlo method in a very naive way to randomise energy and direction for each simulated particle. The flux of cosmic rays is modelled as a rain coming from a plane above the object of interest (detectors in particle physics applications, planes in dosimetry studies, etc.) with an experimental angular and energy distributions. This strategy is very inefficient because many of the particles never touch the detector. Here a refined way of implementing the Montecarlo method is proposed in order to generate a sample of events that hit the target volume whose angular distribution coincides with the one from the naive implementation. It is based on the projection of a sphere containing the target volume onto a plane tangent to it with a fixed angle, we call it the secant method. This configuration allows to compute the probability of a cosmic particle hitting the sphere with this incoming angle as proportional to the area of the corresponding section of a cylinder. The performance of this method is faster in terms of computing time and identical physical results are achieved. It has been implemented in REST-for-Physics framework and it is tested with the geometry of a real detector, the IAXO-D0 Micromegas X-ray detector for the future axion helioscope BabyIAXO. Our method is 37 times more efficient than the traditional Montecarlo schema for the same accuracy, being more useful when the target volume departs from spherical shape</description>

      <title>Experimental search for neutron-antineutron oscillation with use of ultra-cold neutrons revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron-antineutron oscillation (nnbar-osc) is a baryon-number-violating process and a sensitive probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. Ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs) are attractive for nnbar-osc searches because of their long storage time, but earlier analyses indicated that phase shifts on wall reflection differ for neutron and antineutron, leading to severe decoherence and loss of sensitivity. Here we revisit this problem by numerically solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for the two-component n/nbar wave function, explicitly including wall interactions. We show that decoherence can be strongly suppressed by selecting a wall material whose neutron and antineutron optical potentials are nearly equal. Using coherent scattering length data and estimates for antineutrons, we identify a Ni-Al alloy composition that matches the potentials within a few percent while providing a high absolute value, enabling long UCN storage. With such a bottle and an improved UCN source, the sensitivity could reach an oscilla-tion period tau_nnbar of order 10^10 s, covering most of the range predicted by certain grand-unified models. This approach revives the feasibility of high-sensitivity nnbar-osc searches using stored UCNs and offers a clear path to probe baryon-number violation far beyond existing limits.</description>
