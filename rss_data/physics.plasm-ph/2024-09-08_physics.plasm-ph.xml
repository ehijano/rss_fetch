      <title>Spot size dependent shock wave, plume and ion expansion dynamics of laser produced YBCO plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion dynamics of laser produced plasma plumes in gaseous atmospheres exhibit information on plasma-ambient gas interactions which result in plume splitting, shock formation, sharpening and confinement. We investigate laser spot size variation on shock wave, plume, and ion dynamics from laser produced YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) plasmas using fast photography and Langmuir probe diagnosis. Changes in plume geometry are observed with varying focal spot size. At smaller spot sizes, lateral expansion of the plume is found to be larger, and plume expansion is spherical, while at larger spot sizes plume expansion is more cylindrical. Shock front formation time, relative intensity, spatial extent and total charge yield (TCY) are all dependent on laser spot size. Total charge yield (TCY) increases as the spot area increases, but decreases beyond a certain value. The width of the ion velocity distribution and the peak velocity decrease with increasing spot size, demonstrate that ions corresponding to larger spot sizes are somewhat more monoenergetic.</description>

      <title>Exploring the operational limits of Mirnov coil arrays in stellarators by means of a synthetic diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A synthetic Mirnov coils diagnostic is presented and used to study the capabilities of the poloidal array of single-axis coils and the two helical arrays of tri-axial coils installed in the TJ-II stellarator. This tool integrates the plasma currents induced by Alfv\'en-like perturbations of the electric potential inside the plasma and provides the induced magnetic field oscillations anywhere outside of it. The simulated signals can then be analyzed in the same manner as the experimental ones, and a scan on the radial position and width of the potential perturbation is conducted to find the limiting values that produce identifiable signals. We find, not surprisingly, that core-localized modes are indistinguishable from one another; and that the identification of low-n, low-m modes is often subject to off-by-one errors. We also determine the optimal polarization basis in which to analyze the tri-axial coils signals and address the diagnostic performance when resolving components of gap modes such as HAEs. Additionally, selected cases have been analyzed with a simplified plasma response model, showing that plasma shielding of the mode currents may further deteriorate the accuracy of the mode identification method. The code for this synthetic diagnostic, that can be easily used to conduct similar analysis for other devices, is publicly available in http://github.com/pponsv/synth_mirnov .</description>

      <title>Infra-red thermographic inversion in ST40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new tool for infra-red thermographic inversion on Tokamak Energy's spherical tokamak, ST40, is developed in-house and here presented. Functional Analysis of Heat Flux (FAHF) is written in Python, and configured for multi-2D thermographic inversions, solving the heat conduction equation within the divertor tiles via the finite difference method, and leveraging an explicit time-marching scheme. Using infra-red camera data of the highest effective spatial resolution available, FAHF ultimately outputs the plasma perpendicular heat flux on the divertor, crucial quantity in any edge plasma investigation. In the present work, the internal numerics of the tool is first successfully verified by formal time and space convergence analyses, and corroborated by an energy balance assessment. A significant sensitivity of the perpendicular heat flux computed by FAHF to the user-selected spatial resolution is then evidenced. However, a precise heat flux is proved to be recoverable by ensuring a sufficiently high resolution. Last, the appropriateness of the model/geometry simplifications adopted in FAHF is successfully confirmed, by means of comparison against COMSOL Multiphysics simulations. FAHF is hence conclusively proven to qualify as a precise and accurate tool for infra-red thermographic inversions.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of streamers is determined at their heads, for individual streamers as well as in collective phenomena, such as streamer trees or coronas or streamer bursts ahead of lighting leaders. Some properties of the streamer heads, such as velocity v and radius R now can be measured quite well, but this is very challenging for others such as the maximal electric field, the charge content at the streamer head and the degree of chemical excitation and ionization in the streamer channel. Here we develop, test and evaluate a macroscopic approximation for positive streamer heads in air that relates macroscopic streamer head properties to each other. In particular, we find that velocity v, radius R and background field E_bg determine the complete profile of streamer heads with photoionization, if they propagate steadily. We also revisit Naidis' approximate relation between v, R and the maximal field E_max. The approximate head model consists of three first-order ordinary differential equations along the streamer axis. It is derived from the classical fluid model for streamer discharges by assuming axisymmetry, steady streamer propagation (with constant velocity and shape), and a (semi-)spherical shape of the charge layer. The model shows good agreement with solutions of the classical fluid model, even when it is applied to accelerating streamers. Therefore the model can be used for evaluations of experiments, like measurements of the maximal electric field, and it could be a valuable tool in constructing reduced models for the collective dynamics of many streamer discharges.</description>

      <title>Empirically extending 1D Child-Langmuir theory to a finite temperature beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solutions to the 1D steady-state Vlasov-Poisson system are used to develop a straightforward empirical formula for the electric current density transmitted through a vacuum diode (voltage gap) as a function of gap distance, gap voltage, the injected current density, and the average velocity and temperature of injected particles, as well as their charge and mass. This formula generalizes the 1D cold beam Child-Langmuir law (which predicts the maximum transmitted current for mono-energetic particles in a planar diode as a function of gap voltage and distance) to the case where particles are injected with a finite velocity spread. Though this case is of practical importance, no analytical solution is known. Found by a best-fit to results from particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, the empirical formula characterizes the current transmitted across the diode for an injected velocity distribution of a drifting Maxwellian. It is not meant to yield a precise answer, but approximately characterizes the effect of space charge on transmitted current density over a large input space. The formula allows quick quantitative estimation of the effect of space charge in diode-like devices, such as gate-anode gaps in nanoscale vacuum channel transistors.</description>

      <title>Propagation of strong electromagnetic waves in tenuous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in tenuous plasmas, where the wave frequency, $\omega_0$, is much larger than the plasma frequency, $\omega_{\rm P}$. We show that in pair plasmas nonlinear effects are weak for $a_0 \ll \omega_0/\omega_{\rm P}$, where $a_0$ is the wave strength parameter. In electron-proton plasmas a more restrictive condition must be satisfied, namely either $a_0\ll 1/\omega_{\rm P}\tau_0$, where $\tau_0$ is the duration of the radiation pulse, or $a_0\ll 1$. We derive the equations that govern the evolution of the pulse in the weakly nonlinear regime. Our results have important implications for the modeling of fast radio bursts. We argue that: (i) Millisecond duration bursts with a smooth profile must be produced in a proton-free environment, where nonlinear effects are weaker. (ii) Propagation through an electron-proton plasma near the source can imprint a sub-microsecond variability on the burst profile.</description>

      <title>Buoyant crystals halt the cooling of white dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs are stellar remnants devoid of a nuclear energy source, gradually cooling over billions of years and eventually freezing into a solid state from the inside out. Recently, it was discovered that a population of freezing white dwarfs maintains a constant luminosity for a duration comparable to the age of the universe, signaling the presence of a powerful yet unknown energy source that inhibits the cooling. For certain core compositions, the freezing process is predicted to trigger a solid-liquid distillation mechanism, due to the solid phase being depleted in heavy impurities. The crystals thus formed are buoyant and float up, thereby displacing heavier liquid downward and releasing gravitational energy. Here we show that distillation interrupts the cooling for billions of years and explains all the observational properties of the unusual delayed population. With a steady luminosity surpassing that of some main-sequence stars, these white dwarfs defy their conventional portrayal as dead stars. Our results highlight the existence of peculiar merger remnants and have profound implications for the use of white dwarfs in dating stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Reduction or enhancement of stellarator turbulence by impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic study of the impact of impurities on the turbulent heat fluxes is presented for the stellarator Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) and, for comparison, the Large Helical Device and ITER. By means of nonlinear multispecies gyrokinetic simulations, it is shown that impurities, depending on the sign of their density gradient, can significantly enhance or reduce turbulent ion heat losses. For the relevant scenario of turbulence reduction, an optimal impurity concentration that minimizes the ion heat diffusivity emerges as a universal feature. This result demonstrates the potential of impurities for controlling turbulence and accessing enhanced confinement regimes in fusion plasmas and, in particular, in W7-X.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of MHD equilibria for generic adapted metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria on a Riemannian 3-manifold satisfy the stationary Euler equations for ideal fluids. A stationary solution $X$ admits a large set of ``adapted" metrics in $M$ for which $X$ solves the corresponding MHD equilibrium equations with the same pressure function. We prove different versions of the following statement: an MHD equilibrium with non-constant pressure on a compact three-manifold with or without boundary admits no continuous Killing symmetries for an open and dense set of adapted metrics. This contrasts with the classical conjecture of Grad which loosely states that an MHD equilibrium on a toroidal Euclidean domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with pressure function foliating the domain with nested toroidal surfaces must admit Euclidean symmetries.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensionality of three-dimensional, magnetically dominated, decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is important in various astrophysical contexts, including early universe magnetic fields, star formation, turbulence in galaxy clusters, magnetospheres and solar corona. Previously known in the nonhelical case of magnetically dominated decaying turbulence, we show that magnetic reconnection is important also in the fully helical case and is likely the agent responsible for the inverse transfer of energy. Again, in the fully helical case, we find that there is a similarity in power law decay exponents in both 2.5D and 3D simulations. To understand this intriguing similarity, we investigate the possible quasi-two-dimensionalization of the 3D system. We perform Minkowski functional analysis and find that the characteristic length scales of a typical magnetic structure in the system are widely different, suggesting the existence of local anisotropies. Finally, we provide a quasi-two-dimensional hierarchical merger model which recovers the relevant power law scalings. In the nonhelical case, we show that a helicity-based invariant cannot constrain the system, and the best candidate is still anastrophy or vector potential squared, which is consistent with the quasi-two-dimensionalization of the system.</description>
