      <title>Softly Symbolifying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.</description>

      <title>Single-Particle X-ray Scattering Reveals a High Local Supersaturation of Precursors as the Origin of CoO Assembly Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle small-angle X-ray scattering (SP-SAXS) enables quantitative morphological analysis by recording diffraction snapshots from isolated particles using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Learning of Anomalous Diffusion with Wavelet Representations: Enabling Direct Learning from Experimental Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a versatile tool for analyzing anomalous diffusion trajectories, yet most existing pipelines are trained on large collections of simulated data. In contrast, experimental trajectories, such as those from single-particle tracking (SPT), are typically scarce and may differ substantially from the idealized models used for simulation, leading to degradation or even breakdown of performance when ML methods are applied to real data. To address this mismatch, we introduce a wavelet-based representation of anomalous diffusion that enables data-efficient learning directly from experimental recordings. This representation is constructed by applying six complementary wavelet families to each trajectory and combining the resulting wavelet modulus scalograms. We first evaluate the wavelet representation on simulated trajectories from the andi-datasets benchmark, where it clearly outperforms both feature-based and trajectory-based methods with as few as 1000 training trajectories and still retains an advantage on large training sets. We then use this representation to learn directly from experimental SPT trajectories of fluorescent beads diffusing in F-actin networks, where the wavelet representation remains superior to existing alternatives for both diffusion-exponent regression and mesh-size classification. In particular, when predicting the diffusion exponents of experimental trajectories, a model trained on 1200 experimental tracks using the wavelet representation achieves significantly lower errors than state-of-the-art deep learning models trained purely on $10^6$ simulated trajectories. We associate this data efficiency with the emergence of distinct scale fingerprints disentangling underlying diffusion mechanisms in the wavelet spectra.</description>

      <title>Transcript-based estimators for characterizing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of transcripts was introduced in 2009 as a means to characterize various aspects of the functional relationship between time series of interacting systems. Based on this concept that utilizes algebraic relations between ordinal patterns derived from time series, estimators for the strength, direction, and complexity of interactions have been introduced. These estimators, however, have not yet found widespread application in studies of interactions between real-world systems. Here, we revisit the concept of transcripts and showcase the usage of transcript-based estimators for a time-series-based investigation of interactions between coupled paradigmatic dynamical systems of varying complexity. At the example of a time-resolved analysis of multichannel and multiday recordings of ongoing human brain dynamics, we demonstrate the potential of the methods to provide novel insights into the intricate spatial-temporal interactions in the human brain underlying different vigilance states.</description>

      <title>Inference of a time delay in stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</description>
