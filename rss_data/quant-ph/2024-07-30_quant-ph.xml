      <title>Enhancing Quantum Field Theory Simulations on NISQ Devices with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Routing and wavelength assignment in quantum key distribution networks: power control heuristics for quantum-classical multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution networks grow in size and complexity, resource assignment has become increasingly important. In passive optical networks without wavelength conversion, we need to assign a full route between origin and destination with the same wavelength from a finite set. This problem is computationally intensive and the common solution in classical optical networks is using heuristics. We adapt these heuristics to hybrid quantum networks where the quantum channel can share some of the optical links with classical channels. In this quantum-classical multiplexing, nonlinear effects can become the limiting factor in the range of the network. The signal in the classical channels can be subject to Raman Scattering or Four-Wave-Mixing and produce light in the quantum channels. While these effects are not efficient, even a single photon can ruin the quantum channel. We propose heuristics for the routing and wavelength assignment problem for hybrid quantum-classical networks with power control for the classical channels. By keeping the transmitted power to its bare functional minimum, we can reduce the interference to the quantum channels. We study their efficiency under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast, all-optical coherence of molecular electron spins in room-temperature, aqueous solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tunability and spatial precision of paramagnetic molecules makes them attractive for quantum sensing. However, usual microwave-based detection methods have poor temporal and spatial resolution, and optical methods compatible with room-temperature solutions have remained elusive. Here, we utilize pump-probe polarization spectroscopy to initialize and track electron spin coherence in a molecule. Designed to efficiently couple spins to light, aqueous $K_{2}IrCl_{6}$ enables detection of few-picosecond free induction decay at room temperature and micromolar concentrations. Viscosity is found to strongly vary decoherence lifetimes. This work redefines the meaning of room-temperature coherence by improving experimental time resolution by up to five orders of magnitude. Doing so unveils a new regime of electron spin coherence, opening the door to new synthetic design and applications of molecular quantum bits.</description>

      <title>Designing a Universal Quantum Switch for Arbitrary Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum switch is a superoperator that, in general, creates a superposition of various causal orders of two or more quantum dynamics that are all divisible in the complete positivity (CP) sense. We introduce a process that we term as the universal quantum switch (UQS), which unlike conventional quantum switches, allows for the construction of a quantum switch that can superpose different causal orders of any set of quantum dynamics, regardless of their CP-divisibility. Our approach also enables the construction of a quantum switch while considering a single environment connected with the system, in contrast to the traditional one. Moreover, we show the UQS provides more advantages in performance for a certain state discrimination task compared to traditional quantum switches. The next question that we address is the following: What is the CP-divisibility characteristic of a dynamics built by acting a quantum switch on CP-divisible or -indivisible dynamics? In this regard, an example is presented where the dynamics created by the action of the UQS on two CP-indivisible dynamics is CP-indivisible. Additionally, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the channel created by acting the traditional quantum switch on two CP-divisible dynamics to be CP-divisible. Furthermore, we present some examples of CP-divisible dynamics on which, when the usual quantum switch is operated, the resulting dynamics not only becomes CP-indivisible but also turns into P-indivisible. Our findings demonstrate that quantum switches can build CP-divisible, CP-indivisible, and even P-indivisible dynamics from CP-divisible dynamics, underscoring the versatility of this technique.</description>

      <title>A Relationship Between Nonphysical Quasi-probabilities and Nonlocality Objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19061v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states, covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Optical Entanglement from Pulse-pumped Electro-optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangling microwave and optical photons is one of the promising ways to realize quantum transduction through quantum teleportation. This paper investigates the entanglement of microwave-optical photon pairs generated from an electro-optomechanical system driven by a blue-detuned pulsed Gaussian pump. The photon pairs are obtained through weak parametric-down-conversion, and their temporal correlation is revealed by the second-order correlation function. We then study the discrete variable entanglement encoded in the time bin degree of freedom, where entanglement is identified by Bell inequality violation. Furthermore, we estimate the laser-induced heating and show that the pulse-pumped system features lower heating effects while maintaining a reasonable coincidence photon counting rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-phonon Fock state heralding with single-photon detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognized as a potential resource for quantum technologies and a possible testbed for fundamental physics, the control and preparation of nonclassical states of mechanical oscillators has been explored extensively. Within optomechanics, quantum state synthesis can be realized by entangling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom followed by optical detection. Single-photon detection enables one of the most powerful forms of such heralded quantum state preparation, permitting the creation of single phonon states when applied to conventional cavity optomechanical systems. As the complexity of optomechanical systems increases, single-photon detection may provide heralded access to a larger class of exotic quantum states. Here, we examine the quantum dynamics of optomechanical systems that permit forward Brillouin scattering, where a single phonon mode mediates transitions between a collection of equally spaced optical resonances. Solving both the Schrodinger equation and the Lindblad master equation for this system, we find that initial states comprised of single photons or weak laser pulses evolve into complex quantum states where the frequency of single photon states and the phonon occupation number are entangled. Physically, these interactions permit a single photon to scatter to lower frequencies, where phonon excitation occurs for each scattering event. Combining this result with frequency filtering, we show how single-photon detection can herald selected multi-phonon Fock states, even in the presence of optical losses. We also present an approach for quantum tomography of the heralded phonon states.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of the realtime protection for user privacy in practical quantum private query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum private query (QPQ) is the quantum version for symmetrically private retrieval. However, the user privacy in QPQ is generally guarded in the non-realtime and cheat sensitive way. That is, the dishonest database holder's cheating to elicit user privacy can only be discovered after the protocol is finished (when the user finds some errors in the retrieved database item). Such delayed detection may cause very unpleasant results for the user in real-life applications. Current efforts to protect user privacy in realtime in existing QPQ protocols mainly use two techniques, i.e., adding an honesty checking on the database or allowing the user to reorder the qubits. We reexamine these two kinds of QPQ protocols and find neither of them can work well. We give concrete cheating strategies for both participants and show that honesty checking of inner participant should be dealt more carefully in for example the choosing of checking qubits. We hope such discussion can supply new concerns when detection of dishonest participant is considered in quantum multi-party secure computations.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase diagram with the MBDL and delocalization states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase diagram. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL regime, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>

      <title>Resourcefulness vs indivisibility in quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum dynamics can be categorized in several ways, including according to their divisibility. For any quantum channel acting for any finite time period, we propose measures of P-indivisibility and CP-indivisibility, where P and CP stand for positivity and complete positivity respectively. Subsequently, we also propose two quantities to measure the resourcefulness - with respect to an arbitrary quantum resource - of any quantum channel within any finite time interval. Moreover, we find a bridge between these two classes of metrics, viz. those quantifying divisibilities of quantum channels and those gauging their resourcefulness, by identifying two separate relations between elements of one class with those of the other. Lastly, we verify the two relations using quantum non-Markovianity as a channel resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating complex many-body systems and finding their ground states, combining the use of tensor networks and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques. The algorithm is based on von Neumann's measurement prescription, which serves as a conceptual building block for quantum phase estimation. We describe the implementation and simulation of the algorithm, including the estimation of resources required and the use of matrix product operators (MPOs) to represent the Hamiltonian. We highlight the potential applications of the algorithm in simulating quantum spin systems and electronic structure problems.</description>

      <title>An Inequality for Entangled Qutrits in SU(3) basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known from the representation theory of particle physics that the tensor product of two fundamental representation of SU(2) and SU(3) group can be decomposed to obtain the desired spectrum of the physical states. In this paper, we apply this tenet in case of two {\it non-local} qubits and qutrits, which leads the complete spectrum of their entangled states in their respective basis. For qutrit system, the study of their properties reveals the existence of a new $\sqrt{2}$ inequality, in addition to usual Bell-CHSH type $2\sqrt{2}$ inequality, which is significant from the experimental point of view.</description>

      <title>General theory of cavity-mediated interactions between low-energy matter excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of low-energy matter properties such as superconductivity, ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity via cavity quantum electrodynamics engineering has been suggested as a way to enhance these many-body collective phenomena. In this work, we investigate the effective interactions between low-energy matter excitations induced by the off-resonant coupling with cavity electromagnetic modes. We extend previous work by going beyond the dipole approximation accounting for the full polarization and magnetization densities of matter. We further include the often neglected diamagnetic interaction and, for the cavity, we consider general linear absorbing media with possibly non-local and non-reciprocal response. We demonstrate that, even in this general scenario, the effective cavity-induced interactions between the matter degrees of freedom are of electrostatic and magnetostatic nature. This confirms the necessity of a multimode description for cavity engineering of matter systems where the low-energy assumption holds. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for studying the influence of general optical environments on extended low-energy matter excitations.</description>

      <title>Optimization for expectation value estimation with shallow quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating linear properties of quantum states, such as fidelities, molecular energies, and correlation functions, is a fundamental task in quantum information science. The classical shadow has emerged as a prevalent tool due to its efficiency in estimating many independent observables simultaneously. However, it does not utilize the information of the target observable and the constraints of quantum devices, making it inefficient in many practical scenarios where the focus is on estimating a select few observables. To address this inefficiency, we propose a framework that optimizes sample complexity for estimating the expectation value of any observable using a shallow parameterized quantum circuit. Within this framework, we introduce a greedy algorithm that decomposes the target observable into a linear combination of multiple observables, each of which can be diagonalized with the shallow circuit. Using this decomposition, we then apply an importance sampling algorithm to estimate the expectation value of the target observable. We numerically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by estimating the ground energy of a sparse Hamiltonian and the inner product of two pure states, highlighting the advantages compared to some conventional methods. Additionally, we derive the fundamental lower bound for the sample complexity required to estimate a target observable using a given shallow quantum circuit, thereby enhancing our understanding of the capabilities of shallow circuits in quantum learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a unitary operator in a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space, its unitary contraction to a subspace is defined. The application to quantum graphs is discussed. It is shown how the contraction allows to generate the scattering matrices of new quantum graphs from assembling of simpler graphs. The contraction of quantum channels is also defined. The implementation of the quantum gates corresponding to the contracted unitary operator is investigated, although no explicit construction is presented. The situation is different for the contraction of quantum channels for which explicit implementations are given.</description>

      <title>Anti-Concentration for the Unitary Haar Measure and Applications to Random Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Carbery-Wright style anti-concentration inequality for the unitary Haar measure, by showing that the probability of a polynomial in the entries of a random unitary falling into an $\varepsilon$ range is at most a polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum circuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at least exponentially small in depth, on any output qubit touched by its lightcone.
  We give three applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound that apply to random quantum circuits with Haar random gates:
  $\bullet$ An optimal $\Omega(\log \varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs;
  $\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a bounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit;
  $\bullet$ A polynomial-time algorithm that learns log-depth circuits up to polynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit.
  The first depth lower bound works against any architecture. The latter two algorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can be generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime) over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed scanning microscopy with dual-qubit spin sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning probe microscopy with multi-qubit sensors offers the potential to improve imaging speed and measure previously inaccessible quantities, such as two-point correlations. We develop a multiplexed quantum sensing approach with scanning probes containing two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at the tip apex. A shared optical channel is used for simultaneous qubit initialization and readout, while phase- and frequency-dependent microwave spin manipulations are leveraged for de-multiplexing the optical readout signal. Scanning dual-NV magnetometry is first demonstrated by simultaneously imaging multiple field projections of a ferrimagnetic racetrack device. Then, we record the two-point covariance of spatially correlated field fluctuations across a current-carrying wire. Our multiplex framework establishes a method to investigate a variety of spatio-temporal correlations, including phase transitions and electronic noise, with nanoscale resolution.</description>

      <title>Strength of statistical evidence for genuine tripartite nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in network nonlocality have led to the concept of local operations and shared randomness-based genuine multipartite nonlocality (LOSR-GMNL). In this paper, we consider two recent experimental demonstrations of LOSR-GMNL, focusing on a tripartite scenario where the goal is to exhibit correlations impossible in a network where each two-party subset shares bipartite resources and every party has access to unlimited shared randomness. Traditional statistical analyses measuring violations of witnessing inequalities by the number of experimental standard deviations do not account for subtleties such as memory effects. We demonstrate a more sound method based on the prediction-based ratio (PBR) protocol to analyse finite experimental data and quantify the strength of evidence in favour of genuine tripartite nonlocality in terms of a valid $p$-value. In our work, we propose an efficient modification of the test factor optimisation using an approximating polytope approach. By justifying a further restriction to a smaller polytope we enhance practical feasibility while maintaining statistical rigour.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics of a two qutrits system interacting with a spin environment. Using negativity as the entanglement measure, we study the entanglement dynamics of the system. The calculations show that in cases where the entanglement decays quickly, the environment will have a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Detection of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Two Electron Spins Using a Single NV Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interacting spin system is a great testbed for fundamental quantum physics and applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. For these investigations, detailed information of the interactions, e.g. the number of spins and their interaction strengths, is often required. In this study, we present the identification and characterization of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to two electron spins. In the experiment, we first identify a well isolated single NV center, and characterize its spin decoherence time. Then we perform NV-detected electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to detect surrounding electron spins. From the analysis of the NV-EPR signal, we determine the number of detected spins and their interaction strengths precisely. Moreover, the spectral analysis indicates candidates of the detected spins to be diamond surface spins. This study demonstrates a promising approach for the identification and characterization of an interacting spin system for realizing entangled sensing, using the electron spin as quantum reporters.</description>

      <title>Scalable High-Dimensional Multipartite Entanglement with Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for the preparation of generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of $N$ atoms each with $d=3$ or $4$ internal levels. We generalize the celebrated one-axis twisting (OAT) Hamiltonian for $N$ qubits to qudits by including OAT interactions of equal strengths between every pair of qudit levels, a protocol we call as balanced OAT (BOAT). Analogous to OAT for qubits, we find that starting from a product state of an arbitrary number of atoms $N$, dynamics under BOAT leads to the formation of GHZ states for qutrits ($d=3$) and ququarts ($d=4$). While BOAT could potentially be realized on several platforms where all-to-all coupling is possible, here we propose specific implementations using trapped ion systems. We show that preparing these states with a fidelity above a threshold value rules out lower dimensional entanglement than that of the generalized GHZ states. For qutrits, we also propose a protocol to bound the fidelity that requires only global addressing of the ion crystal and single-shot readout of one of the levels. Our results open a path for the scalable generation and certification of high-dimensional multipartite entanglement on current atom-based quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spans diverse fields from biology to quantum science. Employing NMR on a floating object could unveil novel possibilities beyond conventional operational paradigms. Here, we observe Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) within a levitating micro-diamond using the nuclear spins of nitrogen-14 atoms. By tightly confining the angular degrees of freedom of the diamond in a Paul trap, we achieve efficient hyperfine interaction between optically polarized electronic spins of nitrogen-vacancy centers and the $^{14}$N nuclear spin, enabling nuclear spin polarization and quantum state read-out revealing coherence times up to hundreds of microseconds. This represents the longest recorded spin coherence time in a levitated system, surpassing previous records by three orders of magnitude. Our results offer promise for various applications, including cooling macroscopic particles to their motional ground state and exploring geometric phases for gyroscopy.</description>

      <title>Anomalous symmetry protected blockade of skin effect in one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), an anomalous localization behavior of the bulk states, is an inherently non-Hermitian phenomenon, which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, the fragility of NHSE has been revealed recently, such as the boundary sensitivity, and it stimulates a lot of studies on discussing the fate of that. Here we present a theorem which shows that the combined spatial reflection symmetry can be considered as a criterion in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems to determine whether the NHSE can exist or not. Distinct from previous studies, our proposed criterion only relies on analyzing the symmetry of the system, freeing out other requirements, such as the information of the energy spectrum. Furthermore, by taking the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain as an example, we verify our theorem through both a mathematical proof via the non-Bloch band theory and the exact diagonalization numerical studies. Our results reveal a profound connection between the symmetry and the fate of NHSE.</description>

      <title>Twisted electron impact elastic cross sections of polyatomic molecules: All active electron multicentered approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absolute elastic differential and Integral (total) cross-sections of polyatomic molecules by plane and twisted electron beam (Bessel Beam) impact are presented with $CO_2$ and $N_2O$ as examples. The cross sections are computed theoretically in the First Born Approximation(FBA). The target molecules are modeled using multicentered wavefunctions with Gaussian Type Orbitals(GTOs) and optimized through Density Functional Theory. The electron density obtained as a function of spatial coordinates is used to calculate the elastic form factor while considering the active role of all electrons in the molecule. Coulomb direct potentials are used for the interactions of the incident beam with all electrons and nuclei. An orientation averaging of the differential cross-section is performed to mimic experimental situations. The Young's interference effects due to the nuclei are considered. The cross sections are calculated at intermediate energies ranging from 300eV to 1keV. The proposed methodology can certainly be applied to any polyatomic molecule. The interactions of Bessel beams (Twisted Electron Beam) with topological charges $m_l$ = 1, 2, and 3 are analyzed. The average over impact parameters of the differential cross-sections representing the beam's interaction with a large number of molecules is also studied and presented. Finally, the Integral elastic cross-section (ICS) of the molecules by plane wave and twisted beams is calculated and presented.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing combined with machine learning (ML) is an extremely promising research area, with numerous studies demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to solve scientific problems more effectively than classical ML. In this work, we successfully apply QML to drug discovery, showing that QML can significantly improve model performance and achieve faster convergence compared to classical ML. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model accuracy of the QML improves as the number of qubits increases. We also introduce noise to the QML model and find that it has little effect on our experimental conclusions, illustrating the high robustness of the QML model. This work highlights the potential application of quantum computing to yield significant benefits for scientific advancement as the qubit quantity increase and quality improvement in the future.</description>

      <title>PO-QA: A Framework for Portfolio Optimization using Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio Optimization (PO) is a financial problem aiming to maximize the net gains while minimizing the risks in a given investment portfolio. The novelty of Quantum algorithms lies in their acclaimed potential and capability to solve complex problems given the underlying Quantum Computing (QC) infrastructure. Utilizing QC's applicable strengths to the finance industry's problems, such as PO, allows us to solve these problems using quantum-based algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While the Quantum potential for finance is highly impactful, the architecture and composition of the quantum circuits have not yet been properly defined as robust financial frameworks/algorithms as state of the art in present literature for research and design development purposes. In this work, we propose a novel scalable framework, denoted PO-QA, to systematically investigate the variation of quantum parameters (such as rotation blocks, repetitions, and entanglement types) to observe their subtle effect on the overall performance. In our paper, the performance is measured and dictated by convergence to similar ground-state energy values for resultant optimal solutions by each algorithm variation set for QAOA and VQE to the exact eigensolver (classical solution). Our results provide effective insights into comprehending PO from the lens of Quantum Machine Learning in terms of convergence to the classical solution, which is used as a benchmark. This study paves the way for identifying efficient configurations of quantum circuits for solving PO and unveiling their inherent inter-relationships.</description>

      <title>Dimers and discrete breathers in Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a quasi-periodic potential created by two sub-lattices of comparable amplitudes and incommensurate periods is considered. Although the conventional tight-binding approximation is not applicable in this setting, the description can still be reduced to a discrete model that accounts for the modes below the mobility edge. In the respective discrete lattice, where no linear hopping exists, solutions and their dynamics are governed solely by nonlinear interactions. Families of nonlinear modes, including those with no linear limit, are described with a special focus on dimers, which correspond to breather solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a quasi-periodic potential. The breathers are found to be stable for negative scattering lengths. Localization and stable propagation of breathers are also observed for positive scattering lengths at relatively weak and moderate nonlinearities.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dynamic equation (QDE) of machine learning is obtained based on Schr\"odinger equation and potential energy equivalence relationship. Through Wick rotation, the relationship between quantum dynamics and thermodynamics is also established in this paper. This equation reformulates the iterative process of machine learning into a time-dependent partial differential equation with a clear mathematical structure, offering a theoretical framework for investigating machine learning iterations through quantum and mathematical theories. Within this framework, the fundamental iterative process, the diffusion model, and the Softmax and Sigmoid functions are examined, validating the proposed quantum dynamics equations. This approach not only presents a rigorous theoretical foundation for machine learning but also holds promise for supporting the implementation of machine learning algorithms on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Reverse Map Projections as Equivariant Quantum Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>

      <title>Uncertain Quantum Critical Metrology: From Single to Multi Parameter Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical quantum metrology relies on the extreme sensitivity of a system's eigenstates near the critical point of a quantum phase transition to Hamiltonian perturbations. This means that these eigenstates are extremely sensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In practical settings, there always exists a degree of experimental uncertainty in the control parameters - which are approximately known quantities. Despite such uncertainties representing the most relevant source of noise in critical metrology, their impact on the attainable precision has been largely overlooked. In this work we present a general framework, interpolating between the single and multi-parameter estimation settings, allowing for the proper bookkeeping of relevant errors. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic transverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly showing how uncertainty in control parameters impacts the sensitivity of critical sensors. For finite-size systems, we establish that there exists a trade-off between the amount of uncertainty a many-body probe can withstand while still maintaining a quantum advantage in parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Strong coherent ion-electron coupling using a wire data bus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion-ion coupling over long distances represents a highly useful resource for quantum technologies, for example, to sympathetically cool or interconnect qubits in ion-based quantum-computing architectures. In this respect, the recently demonstrated wire-mediated ion-ion coupling stands due to the simplification of its trap layout and its prospects for deterministic entanglement. However, the strength of such coherent ion-wire-ion coupling is typically weak, hindering its practical utilization. Here, we propose a wire-mediated scheme for coherent ion-electron coupling. The scheme not only enables the sympathetic cooling of electrons via advanced ion-cooling techniques, but also allows to promote the effective ion-ion coupling strength by orders of magnitudes via electron mediation. Our work thus paves a way toward quantum information processing in ion-electron hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Testing Graph Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing graph completeness is a critical problem in computer science and network theory. Leveraging quantum computation, we present an efficient algorithm using the Szegedy quantum walk and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our algorithm, which takes the number of nodes and the adjacency matrix as input, constructs a quantum walk operator and applies QPE to estimate its eigenvalues. These eigenvalues reveal the graph's structural properties, enabling us to determine its completeness. We establish a relationship between the number of nodes in a complete graph and the number of marked nodes, optimizing the success probability and running time. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\log^2n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. offering a clear quantum advantage over classical methods. This approach is useful in network structure analysis, evaluating classical routing algorithms, and assessing systems based on pairwise comparisons.</description>

      <title>Trainability maximization using estimation of distribution algorithms assisted by surrogate modelling for quantum architecture search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) involves optimizing both the quantum parametric circuit configuration but also its parameters for a variational quantum algorithm. Thus, the problem is known to be multi-level as the performance of a given architecture is unknown until its parameters are tuned using classical routines. Moreover, the task becomes even more complicated since well-known trainability issues, e.g., barren plateaus (BPs), can occur. In this paper, we aim to achieve two improvements in QAS: (1) to reduce the number of measurements by an online surrogate model of the evaluation process that aggressively discards architectures of poor performance; (2) to avoid training the circuits when BPs are present. To detect the presence of the BPs, we employed a recently developed metric, information content, which only requires measuring the energy values of a small set of parameters to estimate the magnitude of cost function's gradient. The main idea of this proposal is to leverage a recently developed metric which can be used to detect the onset of vanishing gradients to ensure the overall search avoids such unfavorable regions. We experimentally validate our proposal for the variational quantum eigensolver and showcase that our algorithm is able to find solutions that have been previously proposed in the literature for the Hamiltonians; but also to outperform the state of the art when initializing the method from the set of architectures proposed in the literature. The results suggest that the proposed methodology could be used in environments where it is desired to improve the trainability of known architectures while maintaining good performance.</description>

      <title>A single-photon microwave switch with recoverable control photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum technologies may be applied in prospective architectures employing traditional information processing elements, such as transistors, rectifiers, or switches modulated by low-power inputs. In this respect, recently developed quantum processors based, e.g., on superconducting circuits may alternatively be employed as the basic platform for ultra-low-power consumption classical processors, in addition to obvious applications in quantum information processing and quantum computing. Here we propose a single-photon microwave switch based on a circuit quantum electrodynamics setup, in which a single control photon in a transmission line is able to switch on/off the propagation of another single photon in a separate line. The performances of this single-photon switch are quantified in terms of the photon flux through the output channel, providing a direct comparison of our results with available data. Furthermore, we show how the design of this microwave switch enables the recovery of the single control photon after the switching process. This proposal may be readily realized in state-of-art superconducting circuit technology.</description>

      <title>Modular quantum processor with an all-to-all reconfigurable router</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits provide a promising approach to large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, qubit connectivity on a planar surface is typically restricted to only a few neighboring qubits. Achieving longer-range and more flexible connectivity, which is particularly appealing in light of recent developments in error-correcting codes, however usually involves complex multi-layer packaging and external cabling, which is resource-intensive and can impose fidelity limitations. Here, we propose and realize a high-speed on-chip quantum processor that supports reconfigurable all-to-all coupling with a large on-off ratio. We implement the design in a four-node quantum processor, built with a modular design comprising a wiring substrate coupled to two separate qubit-bearing substrates, each including two single-qubit nodes. We use this device to demonstrate reconfigurable controlled-Z gates across all qubit pairs, with a benchmarked average fidelity of $96.00\%\pm0.08\%$ and best fidelity of $97.14\%\pm0.07\%$, limited mainly by dephasing in the qubits. We also generate multi-qubit entanglement, distributed across the separate modules, demonstrating GHZ-3 and GHZ-4 states with fidelities of $88.15\%\pm0.24\%$ and $75.18\%\pm0.11\%$, respectively. This approach promises efficient scaling to larger-scale quantum circuits, and offers a pathway for implementing quantum algorithms and error correction schemes that benefit from enhanced qubit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state is the best probe for multiparameter estimation of independent local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that estimation of multiple independent field strengths of a local Hamiltonian, i.e., one formed by a sum of single-party terms, necessitates the utility of a highly symmetric genuine multiparty entangled state, viz. the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, as the input probe. This feature however depends on the choice of the weight matrix considered, to define a figure of merit in the multiparameter estimation. We obtain this result by providing a lower bound on the precision of multiparameter estimation, optimized over input probes, for an arbitrary weight matrix. We find that the bound can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues of the arbitrary multiparty local encoding Hamiltonian. We show that there exists a weight matrix for which this bound is attainable only when the probe is the GHZ state, up to a relative phase. In particular, no pure product state can achieve this lower bound. Indeed, the gap - in precision - between genuinely multiparty entangled and product states acting as probes, increases with increasing number of parties. Finally we also prove that using a probe that is in a mixed state provides a precision lower than that for the GHZ state. To emphasize the importance of the weight matrix considered, we also prove that the choice of identity operator as the same - thereby ignoring the covariances in the precision matrix - does not require the use of genuine multiparty entanglement in input probes for attaining the best precision, and the optimal probe can be a pure product.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning Architecture Search via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) has given rise to the burgeoning field of quantum machine learning (QML), aiming to capitalize on the strengths of quantum computing to propel ML forward. Despite its promise, crafting effective QML models necessitates profound expertise to strike a delicate balance between model intricacy and feasibility on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While complex models offer robust representation capabilities, their extensive circuit depth may impede seamless execution on extant noisy quantum platforms. In this paper, we address this quandary of QML model design by employing deep reinforcement learning to explore proficient QML model architectures tailored for designated supervised learning tasks. Specifically, our methodology involves training an RL agent to devise policies that facilitate the discovery of QML models without predetermined ansatz. Furthermore, we integrate an adaptive mechanism to dynamically adjust the learning objectives, fostering continuous improvement in the agent's learning process. Through extensive numerical simulations, we illustrate the efficacy of our approach within the realm of classification tasks. Our proposed method successfully identifies VQC architectures capable of achieving high classification accuracy while minimizing gate depth. This pioneering approach not only advances the study of AI-driven quantum circuit design but also holds significant promise for enhancing performance in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Impact of Parallel Gating on Gate Fidelities in Linear, Square, and Star Arrays of Noisy Flip-Flop Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successfully implementing a quantum algorithm involves maintaining a low logical error rate by ensuring the validity of the quantum fault-tolerance theorem. The required number of physical qubits arranged in an array depends on the chosen Quantum Error Correction code and the achievable physical qubit error rate. As the qubit count in the array increases, parallel gating - simultaneously manipulating many qubits - becomes a crucial ingredient for successful computation. In this study, small arrays of a type of donor- and quantum dot-based qubits, known as flip-flop qubits, are investigated. Simulation results of gate fidelities in linear, square and star arrays of four flip-flop qubits affected by realistic 1/f noise are presented to study the effect of parallel gating. The impact of two, three and four parallel one-qubit gates, as well as two parallel two-qubit gates, on fidelity is calculated by comparing different array geometries. Our findings can contribute to the optimized manipulation of small flip-flop qubit arrays and the design of larger ones.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based uncomputation of quantum circuits for modular arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-based uncomputation (MBU) is a technique used to perform probabilistic uncomputation of quantum circuits. We formalize this technique for the case of single-qubit registers, and we show applications to modular arithmetic. First, we present formal statements for several variations of quantum circuits performing non-modular addition: controlled addition, addition by a constant, and controlled addition by a constant. We do the same for subtraction and comparison circuits. This addresses gaps in the current literature, where some of these variants were previously unexplored. Then, we shift our attention to modular arithmetic, where again we present formal statements for modular addition, controlled modular addition, modular addition by a constant, and controlled modular addition by a constant, using different kinds of plain adders and combinations thereof. We introduce and prove a "MBU lemma" in the context of single-qubit registers, which we apply to all aforementioned modular arithmetic circuits. Using MBU, we reduce the Toffoli count and depth by $10\%$ to $15\%$ for modular adders based on the architecture of [VBE96], and by almost $25\%$ for modular adders based on the architecture of [Bea02]. Our results have the potential to improve other circuits for modular arithmetic, such as modular multiplication and modular exponentiation, and can find applications in quantum cryptanalysis.</description>

      <title>Purification and correction of quantum channels by commutation-derived quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducing the effect of errors is essential for reliable quantum computation. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) and quantum error correction (QEC) are two frameworks that have been proposed to address this task, each with its respective challenges: sampling costs and inability to recover the state for QEM, and qubit overheads for QEC. In this work, we combine ideas from these two frameworks and introduce an information-theoretic machinery called a quantum filter that can purify or correct quantum channels. We provide an explicit construction of a filter that can correct arbitrary types of noise in an $n$-qubit Clifford circuit using $2n$ ancillary qubits based on a commutation-derived error detection circuit. We also show that this filtering scheme can partially purify noise in non-Clifford gates (e.g. T and CCZ gates). In contrast to QEC, this scheme works in an error-reduction sense because it does not require prior encoding of the input state into a QEC code and requires only a single instance of the target channel. Under the assumptions of clean ancillary qubits, this scheme overcomes the exponential sampling overhead in QEM because it can deterministically correct the error channel without discarding any result. We further propose an ancilla-efficient Pauli filter which can remove nearly all the low-weight Pauli components of the error channel in a Clifford circuit using only 2 ancillary qubits similar to flag error correction codes. We prove that for local depolarising noise, this filter can achieve a quadratic reduction in the {average} infidelity of the channel. The Pauli filter can also be used to convert an unbiased error channel into a completely biased error channel and thus is compatible with biased-noise QEC codes which have high code capacity. These examples demonstrate the utility of the quantum filter as an efficient error-reduction technique.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and linear response modeling of high-fidelity Rydberg gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity of entangling operations is a key figure of merit in quantum information processing, especially in the context of quantum error correction. High-fidelity entangling gates in neutral atoms have seen remarkable advancement recently. A full understanding of error sources and their respective contributions to gate infidelity will enable the prediction of fundamental limits on quantum gates in neutral atom platforms with realistic experimental constraints. In this work, we implement the time-optimal Rydberg CZ gate, design a circuit to benchmark its fidelity, and achieve a fidelity, averaged over symmetric input states, of 0.9971(5), setting a new state-of-the-art for neutral atoms. The remaining infidelity is explained by an ab initio error model, consistent with our experimental results over a range of gate speeds, with varying contributions from different error sources. Further, we develop a linear response formalism to efficiently predict infidelity from laser noise with non-trivial power spectral densities and derive scaling laws of infidelity with gate speed. Besides its capability of predicting gate fidelity, we also utilize the linear response formalism to compare and optimize gate protocols, to learn laser frequency noise, and to study the noise response for quantum simulation tasks. Finally, we predict that a CZ gate fidelity of ${\gtrsim} 0.999$ is feasible with realistic experimental upgrades.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Coupled Cluster Theory with Approximate Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism of real-time (RT) methods has been well-established during recent years, while no inclusion beyond the double excitation has been discussed. In this article, we introduce an implementation of real-time coupled cluster singles, doubles and approximate triples (CC3) method to explore the potential of a high excitation level. The CC3 method is well-known for its advantages in calculating dynamic properties and combining with the response theory. It is a well-qualified candidate for handling the interaction between the system and the applied field, and therefore suitable for a RT implementation. The derivation and implementation are first demonstrated following applications on calculating frequency-dependent properties. Terms with triples are calculated and added upon the existing CCSD equations, giving the method a formally $N^{7}$ scaling. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated implementation is utilized to reduce the computational cost. It is been verified that the GPU implementation can speed up the calculation by up to a factor of 17 for water cluster test cases. Additionally, the single-precision arithmetic is used and compared to the conventional double-precision arithmetic. No significant difference is found in the polarizabilities and $G'$ tensor results, but a higher percentage error for the first hyperpolarizabilities is observed. Compared to the linear response (LR) CC3 results, the percentage errors of RT-CC3 polarizabilities and RT-CC3 first hyperpolarizabilities are under 0.1% and 1%, respectively for the $H_2O$/cc-pVDZ test case. Furthermore, a discussion on the calculation of polarizabilities is included, which compares RT-CC3 with RT-CCSD and time-dependent nonorthogonal orbital-optimized coupled cluster doubles (TDNOCCD), in order to examine the performance of RT-CC3 and the orbital-optimization effect using a group of ten-electron systems.</description>

Abstract: Immersing a mobile impurity in a quantum many-body environment can reveal fundamental properties of the background medium, hence providing a powerful probe of quantum matter. This approach is particularly intriguing when considering media with exotic properties, such as strongly-correlated phases and topological states of matter. In this work, we study the dressing of a mobile impurity interacting with a chiral mode, as provided by the edge of topological quantum matter. The resulting ''chiral polaron'' is characterized by an asymmetric spectral function, which reflects the chirality and group velocity of the topological edge mode and the drag experienced by the mobile impurity. We first build our theoretical understanding from an effective one-dimensional chiral model, which captures the hallmark signatures of the chiral polaron. We then demonstrate how this simple picture extends to realistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulator states, by adapting tensor-network methods to polaron spectroscopy. Injecting mobile impurities on the edge of topological quantum matter is shown to be a powerful tool to probe exotic edge properties, particularly suitable for cold-atom experiments.</description>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical tool in neuroscience and clinical practice for monitoring and analyzing brain activity. Traditional neural network models, such as EEGNet, have achieved considerable success in decoding EEG signals but often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of the data. Recent advances in quantum computing present new opportunities to enhance machine learning models through quantum machine learning (QML) techniques. In this paper, we introduce Quantum-EEGNet (QEEGNet), a novel hybrid neural network that integrates quantum computing with the classical EEGNet architecture to improve EEG encoding and analysis, as a forward-looking approach, acknowledging that the results might not always surpass traditional methods but it shows its potential. QEEGNet incorporates quantum layers within the neural network, allowing it to capture more intricate patterns in EEG data and potentially offering computational advantages. We evaluate QEEGNet on a benchmark EEG dataset, BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms traditional EEGNet on most of the subjects and other robustness to noise. Our results highlight the significant potential of quantum-enhanced neural networks in EEG analysis, suggesting new directions for both research and practical applications in the field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we explore the effects of a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we incorporate the effects of GUP into the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling process for Hawking radiation. To this effect, we observe that results obtained due to GUP correction resemble that of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{om} black hole, showing similarities to the nature of an electric charge. We also find that, within this framework, the emission is not purely thermal, thus addressing the information loss problem through the correlation function.</description>

      <title>A phase-space view of vibrational energies without the Born-Oppenheimer framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that following the standard mantra of quantum chemistry and diagonalizing the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Hamiltonian $\hat H_{\rm BO}(\bm R)$ is not the optimal means to construct potential energy surfaces. A better approach is to diagonalize a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian, $\hat H_{\rm PS}(\bm R,\bm P)$, which is parameterized by both nuclear position $\bm R$ and nuclear momentum $\bm P$. The foundation of such a non-perturbative phase-space electronic Hamiltonian can be made rigorous using a partial Wigner transform and the method has exactly the same cost as BO for a semiclassical calculation (and only a slight increase in cost for a quantum nuclear calculation). For a three-particle system, with two heavy particles and one light particle, numerical results show that a phase space electronic Hamiltonian produces not only meaningful electronic momenta (which are completely ignored by BO theory) but also far better vibrational energies. As such, for high level results and/or systems with degeneracies and spin degrees of freedom, we anticipate that future electronic structure and quantum chemistry packages will need to take as input not just the positions of the nuclei but also their momenta.</description>

      <title>Parachatnam-Berry Phase in Optics: Polarization Propagation in Helical Optical Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parachatnam-Berry phase (PBP) is a geometric phase associated with the polarization of light propagating in optical systems. Here, we investigate the physical principles underlying the occurrence of PBP for a single-mode light beam propagating in a single-mode optical fiber with no significant stress-induced birefringence wound into a circular helix configuration. We discuss the effects of curvature and torsion of the helical fiber on the rotation of the polarization vector and the associated PBP. We find the analytic solution for the polarization vector and Stokes parameters of the light for any initial polarization state of the light entering the helical fiber, the analytic expression for the PBP of the light for periodic transport of the light, the intensity of a superposition of the initial and final beams which depends on the PBP, and we discuss the effects of fluctuations of the parameters specifying the geometry and the material characteristics of the helical fiber on the PBP. We also discuss the relationship between the PBP and the solid angle subtended by the tangent vector of the helix plotted on the unit sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The curves of zero intensity of a complex optical field can form knots and links: optical vortex knots. Both theoretical constructions and experiments have so far been restricted to the very small families of torus knots or lemniscate knots. Here we describe a mathematical construction that presumably allows us to generate optical vortices in the shape of any given knot or link. We support this claim by producing for every knot $K$ in the knot table up to 8 crossings a complex field $\Psi:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies the paraxial wave equation and whose zeros have a connected component in the shape of $K$. These fields thus describe optical beams in the paraxial regime with knotted optical vortices that go far beyond previously known examples.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomenons when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Giant Purcell broadening and Lamb shift for DNA-assembled near-infrared quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the light emitted by individual molecules is instrumental to a number of novel nanotechnologies ranging from super-resolution bio-imaging and molecular sensing to quantum nanophotonics. Molecular emission can be tailored by modifying the local photonic environment, for example by precisely placing a single molecule inside a plasmonic nanocavity with the help of DNA origami. Here, using this scalable approach, we show that commercial fluorophores experience giant Purcell factors and Lamb shifts, reaching values on par with those recently reported in scanning tip experiments. Engineering of plasmonic modes enables cavity-mediated fluorescence far detuned from the zero-phonon-line (ZPL) - at detunings that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than the fluorescence linewidth of the bare emitter and reach into the near-infrared. Our results evidence a regime where the emission linewidth is dominated by the excited state lifetime, as required for indistinguishable photon emission, baring relevance to the development of nanoscale, ultrafast quantum light sources and to the quest toward single-molecule cavity-QED. In the future, this approach may also allow to design efficient quantum emitters at infrared wavelengths, where standard organic sources have a reduced performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients $-$ Towards High Throughput Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to create monopoles with half-integer magnetic charges in a spinful cold atom system. With a minimal monopole in the center, we derive the ground-state single-vortex wave function on the sphere and develop the vortex's kinematic equation in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. The vortex's trajectory is generally depicted by the precession of the system. We further formulate the inter-vortex interaction and build up a theory of multi-vortex dynamics in high-charge monopole systems. We predict the vortices'trajectory in the bi-vortex system and figure out stable vortex (line) patterns in multi-vortex systems. Our study provides deep insights into properties of magnetic monopoles and vortices and paves the way for experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Spin-self-organization in an optical cavity facilitated by inhomogeneous broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the onset of collective spin-self-organization in a thermal ensemble of driven two-level atoms confined in an optical cavity. The atoms spontaneously form a spin-pattern above a critical driving strength that sets a threshold and is determined by the cavity parameters, the initial temperature, and the transition frequency of the atomic spin. Remarkably, we find that inhomogeneous Doppler broadening facilitates the onset of spin-self-organization. In particular, the threshold is non-monotonic when increasing the spin transition frequency and reaches a minimum when the Doppler broadening is of similar magnitude. This feature emerges due to Doppler-induced resonances. Above the threshold, we find cooperative dynamics of spin, spatial, and momentum degrees of freedom leading to density modulations, fast reduction of kinetic energy, and the emergence of non-thermal states. More broadly, our work demonstrates how broadening can facilitate strong light-matter interactions in many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a direct axion dark matter (DM) search using superconducting transmon qubits as quantum sensors. With an external magnetic field applied, axion DM generates an oscillating electric field which causes the excitation of the qubit; such an excitation can be regarded as a signal of the axion DM. We provide a theoretical consideration of the excitation process of the qubits taking into account the effects of the shielding cavity surrounding the qubits and estimate the signal rate for the axion DM detection. We also discuss the enhancement of the DM signal by using cavity resonance and entangled quantum sensors realized by a quantum circuit. Combining these two effects, we can reach the parameter region suggested by QCD axion models.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networking is an emerging area with the potential to transform information processing and communications. In this paper, we present a brief introduction to quantum network control, an area in quantum networking dedicated to designing algorithms for distributing entanglement (i.e., entangled qubits). We start by explaining what qubits and entanglement are and how they furnish quantum network control operations such as entanglement swapping and teleportation. With those operations, we present a model for distributing entanglement in a multi-hop quantum network to enable applications such as quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. We conclude the paper by presenting open research problems in the field, including the characterization of the quantum network capacity region and the design of throughput-optimal policies.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the capacity of the quantum switch for two decoherence models: when link-level entanglements last (i) for a time slot, or (ii) until they are used to serve a request (i.e., there is no decoherence). The two models are important as they set lower and upper bounds on the capacity region for any other decoherence model. The paper's contributions are to characterize the switch capacity region for both decoherence models and to propose throughput-optimal policies based on gradient descent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce HOBOTAN, a new solver designed for Higher Order Binary Optimization (HOBO). HOBOTAN supports both CPU and GPU, with the GPU version developed based on PyTorch, offering a fast and scalable system. This solver utilizes tensor networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems, employing a HOBO tensor that maps the problem and performs tensor contractions as needed. Additionally, by combining techniques such as batch processing for tensor optimization and binary-based integer encoding, we significantly enhance the efficiency of combinatorial optimization. In the future, the utilization of increased GPU numbers is expected to harness greater computational power, enabling efficient collaboration between multiple GPUs for high scalability. Moreover, HOBOTAN is designed within the framework of quantum computing, thus providing insights for future quantum computer applications. This paper details the design, implementation, performance evaluation, and scalability of HOBOTAN, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the phase diagram of a parallel double-quantum-dot Andreev molecule, where the two quantum dots are coupled to a common superconducting lead. Using the numerical renormalization group method, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter space of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and inter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet, doublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being a distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum dots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including the atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex behavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe limitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution when extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective models except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation failed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false predictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on quantum-dot architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) are a promising platform for multiple different qubit implementations, all of which are voltage-controlled by programmable gate electrodes. However, as the QD arrays grow in size and complexity, tuning procedures that can fully autonomously handle the increasing number of control parameters are becoming essential for enabling scalability. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm for initializing a depletion mode QD device in preparation for subsequent phases of tuning. During bootstrapping, the QD device functionality is validated, all gates are characterized, and the QD charge sensor is made operational. We demonstrate the bootstrapping protocol in conjunction with a coarse tuning module, showing that the combined algorithm can efficiently and reliably take a cooled-down QD device to a desired global state configuration in under 8 minutes with a success rate of 96 %. Importantly, by following heuristic approaches to QD device initialization and combining the efficient ray-based measurement with the rapid radio-frequency reflectometry measurements, the proposed algorithm establishes a reference in terms of performance, reliability, and efficiency against which alternative algorithms can be benchmarked.</description>

      <title>Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phases of the Haldane model on the Sierpi\'nski gasket. As a consequence of the fractal geometry, multiple fractal gaps arise. Additionally, a flat band appears, and due to a complex next-nearest neighbour hopping, this band splits and multiple topological flux-induced gaps emerge. Owing to the fractal nature of the model, conventional momentum-space topological invariants cannot be used. Therefore, we characterise the system's topology in terms of a real-space Chern number. In addition, we verify the robustness of the topological states to disorder. Finally, we present phase diagrams for both a fractal gap and a flux-induced gap. Previous work on a similar system claims that fractality "squeezes" the well-known Haldane phase diagram. However, this result arises because a doubled system was considered with two Sierpi\'nski gaskets glued together. We consider only a single copy of the Sierpi\'nski gasket, keeping global self-similarity. In contrast with these previous results, we find intricate and complex patterns in the phase diagram of this single fractal. Our work shows that the fractality of the model greatly influences the phase space of these structures, and can drive topological phases in the multitude of fractal and flux-induced gaps, providing a richer platform than a conventional integer dimensional geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state phases of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder of unit filling via the density-matrix-renormalization-group method and, in particular, the effect of rung-hoppings. In contrast to a single-chain, a commensurate supersolid emerges, and based on the Luttinger parameter, we classify them into two types. The latter leads to a reentrant gapless behavior as the onsite interaction is increased while keeping all other parameters intact. A reentrant gapped transition is also found as a function of nearest-neighbor interactions. Further, we show that the string order characterizing the Haldane phase vanishes for a finite inter-chain hopping amplitude, however small it is. Finally, we propose two experimental platforms to observe our findings, using either dipolar atoms or polar molecules and Rydberg admixed atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum efficiency and vertical position of quantum emitters in hBN determined by Purcell effect in hybrid metal-dielectric planar photonic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) advantageously combine excellent photophysical properties with a potential for integration in highly compact devices. Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high quantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we compare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated by electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep track of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry transfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about their quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their vertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away from the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar structures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition to improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D materials or in planar photonic structures.</description>

      <title>Solving QUBOs with a quantum-amenable branch and bound method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the expected disparity in quantum vs. classical clock speeds, quantum advantage for branch and bound algorithms is more likely achievable in settings involving large search trees and low operator evaluation costs. Therefore, in this paper, we describe and experimentally validate an exact classical branch and bound solver for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems that matches these criteria. Our solver leverages cheap-to-implement bounds from the literature previously proposed for Ising models, including that of Hartwig, Daske, and Kobe from 1984. We detail a variety of techniques from high-performance computing and operations research used to boost solver performance, including a global variable reordering heuristic, a primal heuristic based on simulated annealing, and a truncated computation of the recursive bound. We also outline a number of simple and inexpensive bound extrapolation techniques. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of our solver, comparing its performance to state-of-the-art QUBO and MaxCut solvers, and discuss the challenges of a speedup via quantum branch and bound beyond those faced by any quadratic quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>Quantum copy-protection of compute-and-compare programs in the quantum random oracle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.13865v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Copy-protection allows a software distributor to encode a program in such a way that it can be evaluated on any input, yet it cannot be "pirated" - a notion that is impossible to achieve in a classical setting. Aaronson (CCC 2009) initiated the formal study of quantum copy-protection schemes, and speculated that quantum cryptography could offer a solution to the problem thanks to the quantum no-cloning theorem. In this work, we introduce a quantum copy-protection scheme for a large class of evasive functions known as "compute-and-compare programs" - a more expressive generalization of point functions. A compute-and-compare program $\mathsf{CC}[f,y]$ is specified by a function $f$ and a string $y$ within its range: on input $x$, $\mathsf{CC}[f,y]$ outputs $1$, if $f(x) = y$, and $0$ otherwise. We prove that our scheme achieves non-trivial security against fully malicious adversaries in the quantum random oracle model (QROM), which makes it the first copy-protection scheme to enjoy any level of provable security in a standard cryptographic model. As a complementary result, we show that the same scheme fulfils a weaker notion of software protection, called "secure software leasing", introduced very recently by Ananth and La Placa (eprint 2020), with a standard security bound in the QROM, i.e. guaranteeing negligible adversarial advantage. Finally, as a third contribution, we elucidate the relationship between unclonable encryption and copy-protection for multi-bit output point functions.</description>

Abstract: The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

Abstract: This work deals with the scattering entropy of quantum graphs in many different circumstances. We first consider the case of the Shannon entropy and then the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, which are more adequate to study distinct quantitative behavior such as entanglement and nonextensive behavior, respectively. We describe many results associated with different types of quantum graphs in the presence of several vertices, edges, and leads. In particular, we think the results may be used as quantifiers in models related to the transport in quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing precision of atomic clocks by tuning disorder in accessories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that a quantum device having an accessory involving precision measurement can have an enhancement of its metrological precision in estimating an unknown parameter of the quantum system by insertion of glassy disorder, accidental or engineered. We clearly mention how an unbiased estimator can also be identified in a disordered situation, and how the precision thereof can be bounded by the quantum Cr{\'a}mer-Rao inequality. We compare the Fisher information-based lower bound of the minimum standard deviation of an unbiased estimator, in presence of glassy disorder in the system, with the same of an ideal, viz. disorder-free, situation. The phenomenon can boost the efficiency of certain measuring devices, such as atomic clocks. The precision of these clocks, when measuring time, hinges on the precise determination of the frequency of a two-level atom. In cases where impurities are present in the atom, and can be modeled as a disorder parameter, it is possible for the measurement of frequency to be more accurate than in an ideal, disorder-free scenario. Moreover, disorder insertion can reduce the requirement of entanglement content of the initial probes, which are copies of two-qubit states, along with providing a disorder-induced enhancement.</description>

Abstract: There is a current interest in quantum thermodynamics in the context of open quantum systems. An important issue is the consistency of quantum thermodynamics, in particular the second law of thermodynamics, i.e., the flow of heat from a hot reservoir to a cold reservoir. Here recent emphasis has been on composite system and in particular the issue regarding the application of local or global master equations. In order to contribute to this discussion we discuss two cases, namely as an example a single qubit and as a simple composite system two coupled qubits driven by two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, respectively. Applying a global Lindblad master equation approach we present explicit expressions for the heat currents in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. The analysis is carried out in the Born-Markov approximation. We also discuss issues regarding the possible presence of coherences in the steady state.</description>

      <title>An Improved Classical Singular Value Transformation for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01492v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum speedups in quantum machine learning (QML) by analyzing the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) framework. QSVT, introduced by [GSLW, STOC'19, arXiv:1806.01838], unifies all major types of quantum speedup; in particular, a wide variety of QML proposals are applications of QSVT on low-rank classical data. We challenge these proposals by providing a classical algorithm that matches the performance of QSVT in this regime up to a small polynomial overhead.
  We show that, given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n}$, a vector $b \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, a bounded degree-$d$ polynomial $p$, and linear-time pre-processing, we can output a description of a vector $v$ such that $\|v - p(A) b\| \leq \varepsilon\|b\|$ in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{11} \|A\|_{\mathrm{F}}^4 / (\varepsilon^2 \|A\|^4 ))$ time. This improves upon the best known classical algorithm [CGLLTW, STOC'20, arXiv:1910.06151], which requires $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{22} \|A\|_{\mathrm{F}}^6 /(\varepsilon^6 \|A\|^6 ) )$ time, and narrows the gap with QSVT, which, after linear-time pre-processing to load input into a quantum-accessible memory, can estimate the magnitude of an entry $p(A)b$ to $\varepsilon\|b\|$ error in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\|A\|_{\mathrm{F}}/(\varepsilon \|A\|))$ time.
  Our key insight is to combine the Clenshaw recurrence, an iterative method for computing matrix polynomials, with sketching techniques to simulate QSVT classically. We introduce several new classical techniques in this work, including (a) a non-oblivious matrix sketch for approximately preserving bi-linear forms, (b) a new stability analysis for the Clenshaw recurrence, and (c) a new technique to bound arithmetic progressions of the coefficients appearing in the Chebyshev series expansion of bounded functions, each of which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Estimate distillable entanglement and quantum capacity by squeezing useless entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07228v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Internet relies on quantum entanglement as a fundamental resource for secure and efficient quantum communication, reshaping data transmission. In this context, entanglement distillation emerges as a crucial process that plays a pivotal role in realizing the full potential of the quantum internet. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the distillable entanglement and its closely related essential quantity, the quantum capacity. In this work, we consider a general resource measure known as the reverse divergence of resources which quantifies the minimum divergence between a target state and the set of free states. Leveraging this measure, we propose efficiently computable upper bounds for both quantities based on the idea that the useless entanglement within a state or a quantum channel does not contribute to the distillable entanglement or the quantum capacity, respectively. Our bounds can be computed via semidefinite programming and have practical applications for purifying maximally entangled states under practical noises, such as depolarizing and amplitude damping noises, leading to improvements in estimating the one-way distillable entanglement. Furthermore, we provide valuable benchmarks for evaluating the quantum capacities of qubit quantum channels, including the Pauli channels and the random mixed unitary channels, which are of great interest for the development of a quantum internet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalization is the ability of machine learning models to make accurate predictions on new data by learning from training data. However, understanding generalization of quantum machine learning models has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce the data quantum Fisher information metric (DQFIM). It describes the capacity of variational quantum algorithms depending on variational ansatz, training data and their symmetries. We apply the DQFIM to quantify circuit parameters and training data needed to successfully train and generalize. Using the dynamical Lie algebra, we explain how to generalize using a low number of training states. Counter-intuitively, breaking symmetries of the training data can help to improve generalization. Finally, we find that out-of-distribution generalization, where training and testing data are drawn from different data distributions, can be better than using the same distribution. Our work provides a useful framework to explore the power of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate circuit complexity of unitaries generated by time evolution of randomly chosen strongly interacting Hamiltonians in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we focus on two ensembles of random generators -- the so called Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) and the ensemble of diagonal Gaussian matrices conjugated by Haar random unitary transformations. In both scenarios we prove that the complexity of $\exp(-it H)$ exhibits a surprising behaviour -- with high probability it reaches the maximal allowed value on the same time scale as needed to escape the neighborhood of the identity consisting of unitaries with trivial (zero) complexity. We furthermore observe similar behaviour for quantum states originating from time evolutions generated by above ensembles and for diagonal unitaries generated from the ensemble of diagonal Gaussian Hamiltonians. To establish these results we rely heavily on structural properties of the above ensembles (such as unitary invariance) and concentration of measure techniques. This gives us a much finer control over the time evolution of complexity compared to techniques previously employed in this context: high-degree moments and frame potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range entangled states are vital for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Preparing such states by combining measurements with unitary gates opened new possibilities for efficient protocols with finite-depth quantum circuits. The complexity of these algorithms is crucial for the resource requirements on a large-scale noisy quantum device, while their stability to perturbations decides the fate of their implementation. In this work, we consider stochastic quantum circuits in one and two dimensions comprising randomly applied unitary gates and local measurements. These operations preserve a class of discrete local symmetries, which are broken due to the stochasticity arising from timing and gate imperfections. In the absence of randomness, the protocol generates a symmetry-protected long-range entangled state in a finite-depth circuit. In the general case, by studying the time evolution under this hybrid circuit, we analyze the time to reach the target entangled state. We find two important time scales that we associate with the emergence of certain symmetry generators. The quantum trajectories embody the local symmetry with a time scaling logarithmically with system size, while global symmetries require exponentially long times. We devise error-mitigation protocols that significantly lower both time scales and investigate the stability of the algorithm to perturbations that naturally arise in experiments. We also generalize the protocol to realize toric code and Xu-Moore states in two dimensions, opening avenues for future studies of anyonic excitations. Our results unveil a fundamental relationship between symmetries and dynamics across a range of lattice geometries, which contributes to a broad understanding of the stability of preparation algorithms in terms of phase transitions. Our work paves the way for efficient error correction for quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Measurement-based Quantum Computation towards Physically-driven Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are considered one of the most promising methods for obtaining near-term quantum advantages; however, most of these algorithms are only expressed in the conventional quantum circuit scheme. The roadblock to developing quantum algorithms with the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) scheme is resource cost. Recently, we discovered that the realization of multi-qubit rotation operations requires a constant number of single-qubit measurements with the MBQC scheme, providing a potential advantage in terms of resource cost. The structure of the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA) aligns well with this characteristic. Thus, we propose an efficient measurement-based quantum algorithm for quantum many-body system simulation tasks, called measurement-based Hamiltonian variational ansatz (MBHVA). We then demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and advantages of the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and the Fermi-Hubbard chain. Numerical experiments show that MBHVA is expected to reduce resource overhead compared to quantum circuits, especially in the presence of large multi-qubit rotation operations. Furthermore, when compared to Measurement-based Hardware Efficient Ansatz (MBHEA), MBHVA also demonstrates superior performance. We conclude that the MBQC scheme is potentially feasible for achieving near-term quantum advantages in terms of both resource efficiency and error mitigation, particularly for photonic platforms.</description>

Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing with superconducting circuits is expected to advance from individual processors located in single dilution refrigerators to more powerful distributed quantum computing systems. The realization of hardware platforms for quantum local area networks (QLANs) compatible with superconducting technology is of high importance in order to achieve a practical quantum advantage. Here, we present a fundamental prototype platform for a microwave QLAN based on a cryogenic link connecting two separate dilution cryostats over a distance of $6.6$ m with a base temperature of $52$ mK in the center. Superconducting microwave coaxial cables are employed to form a quantum communication channel between the distributed network nodes. We demonstrate the continuous-variable entanglement distribution between the remote dilution refrigerators in the form of two-mode squeezed microwave states, reaching squeezing of $2.10 \pm 0.02$ dB and negativity of $0.501 \pm 0.011$. Furthermore, we show that quantum entanglement is preserved at channel center temperatures up to $1$ K, paving the way towards microwave quantum communication at elevated temperatures. Consequently, such a QLAN system can form the backbone for future distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel rapid, high-fidelity, and noise-resistant scheme to generate many-body entanglement between multiple qubits stabilized by dissipation into a 1D bath. Using a carefully designed time-dependent drive, our scheme achieves a provably exponential speedup over state-of-the-art dissipative stabilization schemes in 1D baths, which require a timescale that diverges as the target fidelity approaches unity and scales exponentially with the number of qubits. To prepare quantum dimer pairs, our scheme only requires local 2-qubit control Hamiltonians, with a protocol time that is independent of system size. This provides a scalable and robust protocol for generating a large number of entangled dimer pairs on-demand, serving as a fundamental resource for many quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding equilibration and thermalization in isolated many-body quantum systems is a central challenge in quantum physics. The traditional approach focuses on the study of the full state of the quantum system which, at equilibrium, is best described by the Diagonal Ensemble. Here, we present Observable Statistical Mechanics, a novel paradigm that shifts attention from the full quantum state to the statistics of measurement outcomes. This approach is grounded in the Maximum Observable Entropy Principle, positing that equilibrium measurement statistics tend to maximize observable entropy under conserved average energy. By focusing on accessible measurements, the theory accurately predicts equilibrium probability distributions without needing detailed microscopic information like the energy eigenstates. Extensive numerical experiments on 7 spin-1/2 Hamiltonians demonstrate the broad applicability and robustness of this framework.</description>

Abstract: Quantum illumination (QI) and quantum radar have emerged as potentially groundbreaking technologies, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to revolutionise the field of remote sensing and target detection. The protocol, particularly in the context of quantum radar, has been subject to a great deal of aspirational conjecture as well as criticism with respect to its realistic potential. In this review, we present a broad overview of the field of quantum target detection focusing on QI and its potential as an underlying scheme for a quantum radar operating at microwave frequencies. We provide context for the field by considering its historical development and fundamental principles. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion on the state of theoretical and experimental progress towards realising a working QI-based quantum radar, and draw conclusions about its current outlook and future directions.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-Oriented Qubit Mapping for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms implemented on near-term devices require qubit mapping due to noise and limited qubit connectivity. In this paper we propose a strategy called algorithm-oriented qubit mapping (AOQMAP) that aims to bridge the gap between exact and scalable mapping methods by utilizing the inherent structure of algorithms. While exact methods provide optimal solutions, they become intractable for large circuits. Scalable methods, like SWAP networks, offer fast solutions but lack optimality. AOQMAP bridges this gap by leveraging algorithmic features and their association with specific device substructures to achieve optimal and scalable solutions. The proposed strategy follows a two stage approach. First, it maps circuits to subtopologies to meet connectivity constraints. Second, it identifies the optimal qubits for execution using a cost function. Notably, AOQMAP provides both scalable and optimal solutions for variational quantum algorithms with fully connected two qubit interactions on common subtopologies including linear, T-, and H-shaped, minimizing circuit depth. Benchmarking experiments conducted on IBM quantum devices demonstrate significant reductions in gate count and circuit depth compared to Qiskit, Tket, and SWAP network. Specifically, AOQMAP achieves up to an 82% reduction in circuit depth and an average 138% increase in success probability. This scalable and algorithm-specific approach holds the potential to optimize a wider range of quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing, stabilizer operations play a pivotal role, characterized by their remarkable efficiency in classical simulation. This efficiency sets them apart from non-stabilizer operations within the quantum computational theory. In this Letter, we investigate the limitations of classically-simulable measurements in distinguishing quantum states. We demonstrate that any pure magic state and its orthogonal complement of odd prime dimensions cannot be unambiguously distinguished by stabilizer operations, regardless of how many copies of the states are supplied. We also reveal intrinsic similarities and distinctions between the quantum resource theories of magic states and entanglement in quantum state discrimination. The results emphasize the inherent limitations of classically-simulable measurements and contribute to a deeper understanding of the quantum-classical boundary.</description>

      <title>Practical Trainable Temporal Postprocessor for Multistate Quantum Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and demonstrate a trainable temporal post-processor (TPP) harnessing a simple but versatile machine learning algorithm to provide optimal processing of quantum measurement data subject to arbitrary noise processes, for the readout of an arbitrary number of quantum states. We demonstrate the TPP on the essential task of qubit state readout, which has historically relied on temporal processing via matched filters in spite of their applicability only for specific noise conditions. Our results show that the TPP can reliably outperform standard filtering approaches under complex readout conditions, such as high power readout. Using simulations of quantum measurement noise sources, we show that this advantage relies on the TPP's ability to learn optimal linear filters that account for general quantum noise correlations in data, such as those due to quantum jumps, or correlated noise added by a phase-preserving quantum amplifier. Furthermore, we derive an exact analytic form for the optimal TPP weights: this positions the TPP as a linearly-scaling generalization of matched filtering, valid for an arbitrary number of states under the most general readout noise conditions, all while preserving a training complexity that is essentially negligible in comparison to that of training neural networks for processing temporal quantum measurement data. The TPP can be autonomously and reliably trained on measurement data and requires only linear operations, making it ideal for FPGA implementations in cQED for real-time processing of measurement data from general quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Adopting general frameworks for quantum-classical dynamics, we analyze the interaction between quantum matter and a classical gravitational field. We point out that, assuming conservation of momentum or energy, and assuming that the dynamics obeys Hamiltonian formalism or a particular decomposition property set out in the paper, the classical gravitational field cannot change the momentum or energy of the quantum system, whereas the quantum gravitational field can do so. Drawing upon the fundamental relationship between conservation laws and the quantum properties of objects, our analysis offers new perspectives for the study of quantum gravity and provides a novel interpretation of existing experimental observations, such as free fall.</description>

Abstract: Robust control of quantum systems is an increasingly relevant field of study amidst the second quantum revolution, but there remains a gap between taming quantum physics and robust control in its modern analytical form that culminated in fundamental performance bounds. With certain exceptions such as quantum optical systems that can be modeled as linear stochastic differential equations, quantum systems are not amenable to linear, time-invariant, measurement-based robust control techniques, and thus novel gap-bridging techniques must be developed. This survey is written for control theorists to provide a review of the current state of quantum control and outline the challenges faced in trying to apply modern robust control to quantum systems. We present issues that arise when applying classical robust control theory to quantum systems, typical methods used by quantum physicists to explore such systems and their robustness, as well as a discussion of open problems to be addressed in the field. We focus on general, practical applications and recent work to enable control researchers to contribute to advancing this burgeoning field.</description>

Abstract: The estimation of quantum entropies and distance measures, such as von Neumann entropy, R\'enyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, trace distance, and fidelity-induced distances like Bures distance, has been a key area of research. This paper introduces a unified approach using Disentangling Quantum Neural Networks (DEQNN) for estimating these quantities, leveraging continuity bounds and disentanglement in the cost function design. Our mathematical proof demonstrates that DEQNN can preserve quantum entropies and distances in smaller partial states, making them suitable for further estimation. This method is scalable to an arbitrary number of quantum states and is particularly effective for less complex quantum systems. Numerical simulations validate our approach, and we also discuss strategies to enhance trainability and avoid barren plateaus.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, anticipated to drive breakthroughs in computational tasks. This paper discusses the question which security concerns and strengths are connected to QML by means of a systematic literature review. We categorize and review the security of QML models, their vulnerabilities inherent to quantum architectures, and the mitigation strategies proposed. The survey reveals that while QML possesses unique strengths, it also introduces novel attack vectors not seen in classical systems. We point out specific risks, such as cross-talk in superconducting systems and forced repeated shuttle operations in ion-trap systems, which threaten QML's reliability. However, approaches like adversarial training, quantum noise exploitation, and quantum differential privacy have shown potential in enhancing QML robustness. Our review discuss the need for continued and rigorous research to ensure the secure deployment of QML in real-world applications. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to navigate the security aspects of QML.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML), taken individually or combined into quantum-assisted ML (QML), are ascending computing paradigms whose calculations come with huge potential for speedup, increase in precision, and resource reductions. Likely improvements for numerical simulations in engineering imply the possibility of a strong economic impact on the manufacturing industry. In this project report, we propose a framework for a quantum computing-enhanced service ecosystem for simulation in manufacturing, consisting of various layers ranging from hardware to algorithms to service and organizational layers. In addition, we give insight into the current state of the art of applications research based on QC and QML, both from a scientific and an industrial point of view. We further analyse two high-value use cases with the aim of a quantitative evaluation of these new computing paradigms for industrially-relevant settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in a double well potential produces solutions that break the symmetry of the underlying non-interacting Hamiltonian, i.e., asymmetric solutions. The GPE is derived from the more general second-quantized Fock Schroedinger equation (FSE). We investigate whether such solutions appear in the more general case or are artifacts of the GPE. We use two-mode analyses for a variational treatment of the GPE and to treat the Fock equation. An exact diagonalization of the FSE in dual-condensates yields degenerate ground states that are very accurately fitted by phase-state representations of the degenerate asymmetric states found in the GPE. The superposition of degenerate asymmetrical states forms a cat state. An alternative form of cat state results from a change of the two-mode basis set.</description>

Abstract: We present two realizations of an Otto cycle with a quantum planar rotor as the working medium controlled by means of external fields. By comparing the quantum and the classical description of the working medium, we single out genuine quantum effects with regards to the performance and the engine and refrigerator modes of the Otto cycle. The first example is a rotating electric dipole subjected to a controlled electric field, equivalent to a quantum pendulum. Here we find a systematic disadvantage of the quantum rotor compared to its classical counterpart. In contrast, a genuine quantum advantage can be observed with a charged rotor generating a magnetic moment that is subjected to a controlled magnetic field. Here, we prove that the classical rotor is inoperable as a working medium for any choice of parameters, whereas the quantum rotor supports an engine and a refrigerator mode, exploiting the quantum statistics during the cold strokes of the cycle.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold great promise for efficiently simulating Fermionic systems, benefiting fields like quantum chemistry and materials science. To achieve this, algorithms typically begin by choosing a Fermion-to-qubit mapping to encode the Fermioinc problem in the qubits of a quantum computer. In this work, we introduce "treespilation," a technique for efficiently mapping Fermionic systems using a large family of favourable tree-based mappings previously introduced by some of the authors. We use this technique to minimise the number of CNOT gates required to simulate chemical groundstates found numerically using the ADAPT-VQE algorithm. We observe significant reductions, up to $74\%$, in CNOT counts on full connectivity and for limited qubit connectivity-type devices such as IBM Eagle and Google Sycamore, we observe similar reductions in CNOT counts. In many instances, the reductions achieved on these limited connectivity devices even surpass the initial full connectivity CNOT count. Additionally, we find our method improves the CNOT and parameter efficiency of QEB- and qubit-ADAPT-VQE, which are, to our knowledge, the most CNOT-efficient VQE protocols for molecular state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation for Probability Distributions with Mirror Symmetry Using Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuits for loading probability distributions into quantum states are essential subroutines in quantum algorithms used in physics, finance engineering, and machine learning. The ability to implement these with high accuracy in shallow quantum circuits is a critical issue. We propose a novel quantum state preparation method for probability distribution with mirror symmetry using matrix product states. By considering mirror symmetry, our method reduces the entanglement of probability distributions and improves the accuracy of approximations by matrix product states. As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by a shallow quantum circuit primarily comprising nearest-neighbor qubit gates and linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices. Also, our experimental findings reveal that the approximation accuracy in tensor networks depends heavily on the bond dimension, with minimal reliance on the number of qubits. Our method is experimentally demonstrated for a normal distribution encoded into 10 and 20 qubits on a real quantum processor.</description>

      <title>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce state-of-the-art protocols to distill indistinguishable photons, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, while using a modest amount of resources scaling only linearly in $n$. Our resource requirements are both significantly lower and have fewer hardware requirements than previous works, making large-scale distillation experimentally feasible for the first time. This efficient reduction of distinguishability error rates has direct applications to fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computation, potentially leading to improved thresholds for photon loss errors and allowing smaller code distances, thus reducing overall resource costs. Our protocols are based on Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, special cases of which include the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard matrices. This general perspective allows us to unify previous results on distillation protocols and introduce a large family of efficient schemes. We utilize the rich mathematical structure of Fourier transforms, including symmetries and related suppression laws, to quantify the performance of these distillation protocols both analytically and numerically. Finally, our work resolves an open question concerning suppression laws for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform: the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Photon distillation schemes with reduced resource costs based on multiphoton Fourier interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scalable scheme to achieve photon distillation, i.e. the preparation of a single photon with reduced indistinguishability error out of multiple imperfect photons, based on multiphoton interference in Fourier matrices. Our scheme achieves arbitrary error reduction in a single step, removing the need to concatenate multiple rounds of the protocol. Our scheme has resource costs linear in the error reduction, and a constant probability of success for arbitrary error reductions. We find that the scheme both raises the threshold of error correcting codes in photonic quantum computers, as well as reduces the resources required to construct a photonic quantum computer, making it highly promising for implementation in such devices.</description>

      <title>A generalization of quantum pair state transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $s$-pair state in a graph is a quantum state of the form $\mathbf{e}_u+s\mathbf{e}_v$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices in the graph and $s$ is a non-zero complex number. If $s=-1$ (resp., $s=1$), then such a state is called a pair state (resp. plus state). In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect $s$-pair state transfer in continuous quantum walks, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be the adjacency, Laplacian or signless Laplacian matrix of the graph. We characterize perfect $s$-pair state transfer in complete graphs, cycles and antipodal distance-regular graphs admitting vertex perfect state transfer. We construct infinite families of graphs with perfect $s$-pair state transfer using quotient graphs and graphs that admit fractional revival. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions such that perfect state transfer between vertices in the line graph relative to the adjacency matrix is equivalent to perfect state transfer between the plus states formed by corresponding edges in the graph relative to the signless Laplacian matrix. Finally, we characterize perfect state transfer between vertices in the line graphs of Cartesian products relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Structure learning of Hamiltonians from real-time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of Hamiltonian structure learning from real-time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-\mathrm{i} Ht}$ for an unknown local Hamiltonian $H = \sum_{a = 1}^m \lambda_a E_a$ on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover $H$. This problem is already well-understood under the assumption that the interaction terms, $E_a$, are given, and only the interaction strengths, $\lambda_a$, are unknown. But how efficiently can we learn a local Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of its interaction structure?
  We present a new, general approach to Hamiltonian learning that not only solves the challenging structure learning variant, but also resolves other open questions in the area, all while achieving the gold standard of Heisenberg-limited scaling. In particular, our algorithm recovers the Hamiltonian to $\varepsilon$ error with total evolution time $O(\log (n)/\varepsilon)$, and has the following appealing properties: (1) it does not need to know the Hamiltonian terms; (2) it works beyond the short-range setting, extending to any Hamiltonian $H$ where the sum of terms interacting with a qubit has bounded norm; (3) it evolves according to $H$ in constant time $t$ increments, thus achieving constant time resolution. As an application, we can also learn Hamiltonians exhibiting power-law decay up to accuracy $\varepsilon$ with total evolution time beating the standard limit of $1/\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum prepare-and-measure scenario has been studied under various physical assumptions on the emitted states. Here, we first discuss how different assumptions are conceptually and formally related. We then identify one that can serve as a relaxation of all others, corresponding to a limitation on the one-shot accessible information of the state ensemble. This motivates us to study the optimal state discrimination probability of a source subject to these various physical assumptions. We derive general and tight bounds for states restricted by their quantum dimension, their vacuum component, an arbitrary uniform overlap, the magnitude of higher-dimensional signals and the experimenter's trust in their device. Our results constitute a first step towards a more unified picture of semi-device-independent quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>An Abstract Model and Efficient Routing for Logical Entangling Gates on Zoned Neutral Atom Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental achievements have demonstrated the potential of neutral atom architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing. These architectures feature the dynamic rearrangement of atoms during computation, enabling nearly arbitrary two-dimensional rearrangements. Additionally, they employ a zoned layout with dedicated regions for entangling, storage, and readout. This architecture requires design automation software that efficiently compiles quantum circuits to this hardware and takes care that atoms are in the right place at the right time. In this paper, we initiate this line of work by providing, (1) an abstract model of the novel architecture and, (2) an efficient solution to the routing problem of entangling gates. By this, we aim to maximize the parallelism of entangling gates and minimize the overhead caused by the routing of atoms between zones. In addition to that, we keep the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing in mind and consider logical qubit arrays, each of which encodes one logical qubit. We implemented the proposed idea as a tool called NALAC and demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency by showing that it can significantly reduce the routing overhead of logical entangling gates compared to the naive approach. As part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), NALAC is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap.</description>

Abstract: The Gottesman-Knill theorem asserts that quantum circuits composed solely of Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated classically. This theorem hinges on the fact that Clifford gates map Pauli strings to other Pauli strings, thereby allowing for a structured simulation process using classical computations. In this work, we break down the step-by-step procedure of the Gottesman-Knill theorem in a beginner-friendly manner, leveraging concepts such as matrix products, tensor products, commutation, anti-commutation, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors of quantum mechanical operators. Through detailed examples illustrating superposition and entanglement phenomena, we aim to provide a clear understanding of the classical simulation of Clifford gate-based quantum circuits. While we do not provide a formal proof of the theorem, we offer intuitive physical insights at each stage where necessary, empowering readers to grasp the fundamental principles underpinning this intriguing aspect of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Qudit-Generalization of the Qubit Echo and Its Application to a Qutrit-Based Toffoli Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fidelity of certain gates on noisy quantum computers may be improved when they are implemented using more than two levels of the involved transmons. The main impediments to achieving this potential are the dynamic gate phase errors that cannot be corrected via calibration. The standard tool for countering such phase errors in two-level qubits is the echo protocol, often referred to as the dynamical decoupling sequence, where the evolution of a qubit is punctuated by an even number of X gates. We introduce basis cycling, which is a direct generalization of the qubit echo to general qudits, and provide an analytic framework for designing gate sequences to produce desired effects using this technique. We then apply basis cycling to a Toffoli gate decomposition incorporating a qutrit and obtain CCZ gate fidelity values up to 93.8$\pm$0.1%, measured by quantum process tomography, on IBM quantum computers. The gate fidelity remains stable without recalibration even while the resonant frequency of the qutrit fluctuates, highlighting the dynamical nature of phase error cancellation through basis cycling. Our results demonstrate that one of the biggest difficulties in implementing qudit-based gate decompositions on superconducting quantum computers can be systematically overcome when certain conditions are met, and thus open a path toward fulfilling the promise of qudits as circuit optimization agents.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged in recent years as a promise to obtain quantum advantage. These task-oriented algorithms work in a hybrid loop combining a quantum processor and classical optimization. Using a specific class of VQA named variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs), we choose some parameterized quantum circuits to benchmark them at entanglement witnessing and entangled ground state detection for many-body systems described by Heisenberg Hamiltonian, varying the number of qubits and shots. Quantum circuits whose structure is inspired by the Hamiltonian interactions presented better results on cost function estimation than problem-agnostic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. Highly accurate and low-time-complexity decoding algorithms play an indispensable role in making sure quantum error correction works. Among existing decoding algorithms, belief propagation (BP) is notable for its nearly linear time complexity and general applicability to stabilizer codes. However, BP's decoding accuracy without post-processing is unsatisfactory in most situations. This article focuses on improving the decoding accuracy of BP over GF(4) for surface codes. We first propose Momentum-BP and AdaGrad-BP, inspired by machine learning optimization techniques, to reduce oscillation in message updating and break the symmetric trapping sets. We further propose EWAInit-BP, which adaptively updates initial probabilities and provides a 1 to 3 orders of magnitude improvement over traditional BP for planar surface code, toric code, and XZZX surface code without any post-processing method, showing high decoding accuracy even under parallel scheduling. The theoretical $O(1)$ time complexity under parallel scheduling and high accuracy of EWAInit-BP make it a promising candidate for high-precision real-time decoders. Meanwhile, the ideas of the Momentum-BP, AdaGrad-BP and EWAInit-BP provide promising approaches to improve the decoding accuracy of BP to get rid of its reliance on post-processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent investigations have demonstrated that multi-phonon scattering processes substantially influence the thermal conductivity of materials, posing significant computational challenges for classical simulations as the complexity of phonon modes escalates. This study examines the potential of quantum simulations to address these challenges, utilizing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era (NISQ) quantum computational capabilities and quantum error mitigation techniques to optimize thermal conductivity calculations. Employing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we simulate phonon-phonon contributions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). Our methodology involves mapping multi-phonon scattering systems to fermionic spin operators, necessitating the creation of a customized ansatz to balance circuit accuracy and depth. We construct the system within Fock space using bosonic operators and transform the Hamiltonian into the sum of Pauli operators suitable for quantum computation. By addressing the impact of depolarization and non-unitary noise effects, we benchmark the noise influence and implement error mitigation strategies to develop a more efficient model for quantum simulations in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a major source of quantum decoherence in three-dimensional superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) resonators and two-dimensional transmon qubits composed of oxidized niobium: oxygen vacancies in the niobium pentoxide which drive two-level system (TLS) losses. By probing the effect of sequential \textit{in situ} vacuum baking treatments on the RF performance of bulk Nb SRF resonators and on the oxide structure of a representative Nb sample using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), we find a non-monotonic evolution of cavity quality factor $Q_0$ which correlates with the interplay of Nb\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{5} vacancy generation and oxide thickness reduction. We localize this effect to the oxide itself and present the insignificant role of diffused interstitial oxygen in the underlying Nb by regrowing a new oxide \textit{via} wet oxidation which reveals a mitigation of aggravated TLS losses. We hypothesize that such vacancies in the pentoxide serve as magnetic impurities and are a source of TLS-driven RF loss.</description>

      <title>Duality between open systems and closed bilayer systems, and thermofield double states as quantum many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a duality between open many-body systems governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation and satisfying the detailed balance condition on the one side, and closed bilayer systems with a self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the other side. Under this duality, the identity operator on the open system side maps to the thermofield double state which turns out to be a quantum many-body scar of the dual Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$. A remarkable feature of this thermofield scar is a tunable entanglement entropy controlled by the reservoir temperature on the open system side. Further, we identify broad classes of many-body open systems with nontrivial explicit eigen operators $Q$ of the Lindbladian superoperator. The expectation values of the corresponding observables exhibit a simple exponential decay, $\langle Q\rangle_t=e^{-\Gamma t} \langle Q \rangle_0$, irrespectively of the initial state. Under the above duality, these eigen operators give rise to additional (towers of) scars. Finally, we point out that more general superoperators (not necessarily of the GKSL form) can be mapped to self-adjoint Hamiltonians of bilayer systems harbouring scars, and provide an example thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markovian open many-body quantum systems display complicated relaxation dynamics. The spectral gap of the Liouvillian characterizes the asymptotic decay rate towards the stationary state, but it has recently been pointed out that the spectral gap does not necessarily determine the overall relaxation time. Our understanding on the relaxation process before the asymptotically long-time regime is still limited. We here present a collective relaxation dynamics of autocorrelation functions in the stationary state. As a key quantity in the analysis, we introduce the instantaneous decay rate, which characterizes the transient relaxation and converges to the conventional asymptotic decay rate in the long-time limit. Our theory predicts that a bulk-dissipated system generically shows an accelerated decay before the asymptotic regime due to the scrambling of quantum information associated with the operator spreading.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. So far, the transduction efficiency $\eta$ via the magneto-optic Faraday effect (i.e., the light-magnon interaction) in the ferromagnet YIG has been demonstrated to be small as $\eta\sim 10^{-8} \mathrm{-} 10^{-15}$ due to the weak magneto-optic coupling. Here, we take advantage of the fact that three-dimensional topological insulator thin films exhibit a topological Faraday effect that is independent of the sample thickness in the terahertz regime. This leads to a large Faraday rotation angle and therefore enhanced light-magnon interaction in the thin film limit. We show theoretically that the transduction efficiency between microwave and terahertz photons can be greatly improved to $\eta\sim10^{-4}$ by utilizing the heterostructures consisting of topological insulator thin films such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and ferromagnetic insulator thin films such as YIG.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of reacting flows via Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the quantum computing of reacting flows by simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics. The scalar transport equation for reacting flows is transformed into a Hamiltonian system, mapping the dissipative and non-Hermitian problem in physical space to a Hermitian one in a higher-dimensional space. Using this approach, we develop the quantum spectral and finite difference methods for simulating reacting flows in periodic and general conditions, respectively. The present quantum computing algorithms offer a ``one-shot'' solution for a given time without temporal discretization, avoiding iterative quantum state preparation and measurement. We compare computational complexities of the quantum and classical algorithms. The quantum spectral method exhibits exponential acceleration relative to its classical counterpart, and the quantum finite difference method can achieve exponential speedup in high-dimensional problems. The quantum algorithms are validated on quantum computing simulators with the Qiskit package. The validation cases cover one- and two-dimensional reacting flows with a linear source term and periodic or inlet-outlet boundary conditions. The results obtained from the quantum spectral and finite difference methods agree with analytical and classical simulation results. They accurately capture the convection, diffusion, and reaction processes. This demonstrates the potential of quantum computing as an efficient tool for the simulation of reactive flows in combustion.</description>

      <title>Final States in Quantum Cosmology: Cosmic Acceleration as a Quantum Post-Selection Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard quantum theory admits naturally statistical ensembles that are both pre-selected and post-selected, i.e., they involve both an initial and a final state. We argue that there is no compelling physical reason to preclude a probability assignment with a final quantum state at the cosmological level. We therefore analyze the implications of a final state in the probability assignment for quantum cosmology. To this end, we derive effective classical equations of motion for systems subject to both initial and final conditions. Remarkably, these effective equations do not depend on the details of the quantum theory, but only on the geometric features of the classical state space. When applied to Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, these effective equations generically describe cosmic acceleration in the absence of a cosmological constant, dark energy, or modified gravitational dynamics. Therefore, cosmic acceleration emerges as a quantum post-selection effect, that is, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong coupling polarons in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bose polaron is a quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between impurities and Bogoliubov excitation in Bose-Einstein condensates, analogous to the polaron formed by electrons and phonons in solid-state physics. In this paper, we investigate the effect of phase separation on weakly coupled and strongly coupled Bose polarons. Our findings reveal that phase separation induces a remarkable alteration in the properties of weakly coupled Bose polarons. However, in the case of strong coupling, phase separation cannot destroy the highly self-trapping state of Bose polarons.</description>

      <title>Concolic Testing of Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first concolic testing framework specifically designed for quantum programs. The framework defines quantum conditional statements that quantify quantum states and presents a symbolization method for quantum variables. Utilizing this framework, we generate path constraints for each concrete execution path of a quantum program. These constraints guide the exploration of new paths, with a quantum constraint solver determining the outcomes to generate novel input samples and enhance branch coverage. We implemented this framework in Python and integrated it with Qiskit for practical evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our concolic testing framework significantly improves branch coverage and the quality of quantum input samples, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in quantum software testing.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effects in open nonequilibrium quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classical thermal Mpemba effect (where an initially hot system relaxes faster to the final equilibrium state than a cold one) to open quantum systems coupled to several reservoirs. We show that, in general, two different types of quantum Mpemba effects are possible. They may be distinguished by quantum state tomography. However, the existence of a quantum Mpemba effect (without determining the type) can already be established by measuring simpler observables such as currents or energies. We illustrate our general results for the experimentally feasible case of an interacting two-site Kitaev model coupled to two metallic leads.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians for Quantum Systems with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of constructing self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians for a system of $n&gt;2$ non-relativistic quantum particles in dimension three with contact (or zero-range or $\delta$) interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. Following the line of recent works appeared in the literature, we introduce a boundary condition slightly modified with respect to usual boundary condition one has in the one-body problem. With such new boundary condition we can show that the instability property due to the fall to the center phenomenon described by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 is avoided. Then one obtains a physically reasonable Hamiltonian for the system. We apply the method to the case of a gas of $N$ interacting bosons and to the case of $N$ distinguishable particles of equal mass $M$ interacting with a different particle. In the latter case we also discuss the limit of the model for $M \longrightarrow +\infty$. We show that in the limit one obtains the one-body Hamiltonian for the light particle subject to $N$ (non-local) point interactions placed at fixed positions. We will verify that such non-local point interactions do not exhibit the ultraviolet pathologies that are present in the case of standard local point interactions.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Subspaces, The No Synchronization Law, and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a "semi-classical subspace" is introduced. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <title>Study of Topological Phenomena Through Berry Phase in Classical Nonlinear Elastic Granules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometric of Berry phase concept, traditionally rooted in quantum mechanics, has been found to be increasingly significant in classical mechanics, particularly for understanding the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. In this study, we demonstrate the controlled accumulation of the Berry phase in a classical system using a two-level time-dependent elastic bit, analogous to a quantum bit, within a nonlinear environment generated by a two-granular network. The nonlinearity of the granular beads is modulated through the frequency and amplitude of external harmonic excitation, along with static preloading. By employing the orthonormal basis of the nonlinear responses and mapping the displacement coefficients in Bloch states, we reveal how time influences the manipulation of the elastic bit and its states. Our analytical and experimental investigations uncover the Berry phase's role in exposing the various topological characteristics of the classical granular network. This research establishes a crucial link between classical and quantum realms via the Berry phase of an elastic bit, with significant implications for decoherence-free and robust data transfer and information processing.</description>
