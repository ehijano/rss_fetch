      <title>Improved learning rates in multi-unit uniform price auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the strategic participation of electricity producers in electricity day-ahead market, we study the problem of online learning in repeated multi-unit uniform price auctions focusing on the adversarial opposing bid setting. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new modeling of the bid space. Indeed, we prove that a learning algorithm leveraging the structure of this problem achieves a regret of $\tilde{O}(K^{4/3}T^{2/3})$ under bandit feedback, improving over the bound of $\tilde{O}(K^{7/4}T^{3/4})$ previously obtained in the literature. This improved regret rate is tight up to logarithmic terms. Inspired by electricity reserve markets, we further introduce a different feedback model under which all winning bids are revealed. This feedback interpolates between the full-information and bandit scenarios depending on the auctions' results. We prove that, under this feedback, the algorithm that we propose achieves regret $\tilde{O}(K^{5/2}\sqrt{T})$.</description>

      <title>Strategic Network Creation for Enabling Greedy Routing</title>

Abstract: Today we rely on networks that are created and maintained by smart devices. For such networks, there is no governing central authority but instead the network structure is shaped by the decisions of selfish intelligent agents. A key property of such communication networks is that they should be easy to navigate for routing data. For this, a common approach is greedy routing, where every device simply routes data to a neighbor that is closer to the respective destination.
  Networks of intelligent agents can be analyzed via a game-theoretic approach and in the last decades many variants of network creation games have been proposed and analyzed. In this paper we present the first game-theoretic network creation model that incorporates greedy routing, i.e., the strategic agents in our model are embedded in some metric space and strive for creating a network among themselves where all-pairs greedy routing is enabled. Besides this, the agents optimize their connection quality within the created network by aiming for greedy routing paths with low stretch.
  For our model, we analyze the existence of (approximate)-equilibria and the computational hardness in different underlying metric spaces. E.g., we characterize the set of equilibria in 1-2-metrics and tree metrics and show that Nash equilibria always exist. For Euclidean space, the setting which is most relevant in practice, we prove that equilibria are not guaranteed to exist but that the well-known $\Theta$-graph construction yields networks having a low stretch that are game-theoretically almost stable. For general metric spaces, we show that approximate equilibria exist where the approximation factor depends on the cost of maintaining any link.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Strategic Behavior from Large-Population Observational Data Applied to Game Mode Prediction on a Team-Based Video Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the strategic behavior of agents in a real-world multi-agent system using existing state-of-the-art computational game-theoretic tools can be a daunting task, especially when only the actions taken by the agents can be observed. Before attempting such a task, it would be useful to gain insight into whether or not agents are in fact acting strategically at all, from a game-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we present an initial step toward addressing this problem by proposing a general approach based on machine learning fundamentals for detecting potentially strategic behavior. We instantiate the approach by applying state-of-the-art machine learning tools for model selection and performance evaluation of prediction models in the context of detecting the strategic behavior of players for game mode selection in the multiplayer online video game Heroes of the Storm. Specifically, as a baseline, we first train neural networks to predict players' game mode selections using only information about the state of the player themselves. Then, we train a new set of neural networks using the same architectures, this time incorporating "historical co-play" features that encode players' past interactions with other players. We find that including these new features led to statistically significant improvements in game mode prediction accuracy, providing a sufficiently strong signal that players indeed make decisions strategically, which justifies the development of more complex computational game-theoretic tools in the hope of improving modeling and predictive power. We discuss remaining research work about potential approaches to validate the effectiveness of this initial step to detect strategic behavior.</description>
