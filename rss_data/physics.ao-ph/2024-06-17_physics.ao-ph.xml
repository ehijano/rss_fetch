      <title>Lightning-Fast Thunderstorm Warnings: Predicting Severe Convective Environments with Global Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently released suite of AI weather models can produce multi-day, medium-range forecasts within seconds, with a skill on par with state-of-the-art operational forecasts. Traditional AI model evaluation predominantly targets global scores on single levels. Specific prediction tasks, such as severe convective environments, require much more precision on a local scale and with the correct vertical gradients between levels. With a focus on the convective season of global hotspots in 2020, we assess the skill of three top-performing AI models (Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, FourCastNet) for Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and Deep Layer Shear (DLS) at lead-times of up to 10 days against the ERA-5 reanalysis and the IFS operational numerical weather prediction model. Looking at the example of a US tornado outbreak on April 12 and 13, 2020, all models predict elevated CAPE and DLS values multiple days in advance. The spatial structures in the AI models are smoothed in comparison to IFS and ERA-5. The models show differing biases in the prediction of CAPE values, with GraphCast capturing the value distribution the most accurately and FourCastNet showing a consistent underestimation. In seasonal analyses around the globe, we generally see the highest performance by GraphCast and Pangu-Weather, which match or even exceed the performance of IFS. CAPE derived from vertically coarse pressure levels of neural weather models lacks the precision of the vertically fine resolution of numerical models. The promising results here indicate that a direct prediction of CAPE in AI models is likely to be skillful. This would open unprecedented opportunities for fast and inexpensive predictions of severe weather phenomena. By advancing the assessment of AI models towards process-based evaluations we lay the foundation for hazard-driven applications of AI-based weather forecasts.</description>

      <title>Embedding machine-learnt sub-grid variability improves climate model biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The under-representation of cloud formation is a long-standing bias associated with climate simulations. Parameterisation schemes are required to capture cloud processes within current climate models but have known biases. We overcome these biases by embedding a Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) trained on high resolution Unified Model simulations to represent the variability of temperature and specific humidity within a climate model. A trained MOGP model is coupled in-situ with a simplified Atmospheric General Circulation Model named SPEEDY. The temperature and specific humidity profiles of SPEEDY are perturbed at fixed intervals according to the variability predicted from the MOGP. Ten-year predictions are generated for both control and ML-hybrid models. The hybrid model reduces the global precipitation bias by 18\% and over the tropics by 22\%. To further understand the drivers of these improvements, physical quantities of interest are explored, such as the distribution of lifted index values and the alteration of the Hadley cell. The control and hybrid set-ups are also run in a plus 4K sea-surface temperature experiment to explore the effects of the approach on patterns relating to cloud cover and precipitation in a warmed climate setting.</description>

      <title>Centennial-scale variability of the Atlantic Meridional Circulation in CMIP6 models shaped by Arctic-North Atlantic interactions and sea ice biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate variability on centennial timescales has often been linked to internal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). However, due to the scarceness of suitable paleoclimate proxies and long climate model simulations, large uncertainties remain on the magnitude and physical mechanisms driving centennial-scale AMOC variability. For these reasons, we perform, for the first time, a systematic multi-model comparison of centennial-scale AMOC variability in pre-industrial control simulations of state-of-the-art global climate models. Six out of nine models in this study exhibit a statistically significant mode of centennial-scale AMOC variability. Our results show that freshwater exchanges between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic provide a plausible driving mechanism in a subset of models, and that AMOC variability can be amplified by ocean-sea ice feedbacks in the Labrador Sea. The amplifying mechanism is linked to sea ice cover biases, which could provide an observational constraint for centennial-scale AMOC variability.</description>
