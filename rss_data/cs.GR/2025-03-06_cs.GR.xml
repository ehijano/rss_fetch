      <title>Multi-View Depth Consistent Image Generation Using Generative AI Models: Application on Architectural Design of University Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early stages of architectural design, shoebox models are typically used as a simplified representation of building structures but require extensive operations to transform them into detailed designs. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising solution to automate this transformation, but ensuring multi-view consistency remains a significant challenge. To solve this issue, we propose a novel three-stage consistent image generation framework using generative AI models to generate architectural designs from shoebox model representations. The proposed method enhances state-of-the-art image generation diffusion models to generate multi-view consistent architectural images. We employ ControlNet as the backbone and optimize it to accommodate multi-view inputs of architectural shoebox models captured from predefined perspectives. To ensure stylistic and structural consistency across multi-view images, we propose an image space loss module that incorporates style loss, structural loss and angle alignment loss. We then use depth estimation method to extract depth maps from the generated multi-view images. Finally, we use the paired data of the architectural images and depth maps as inputs to improve the multi-view consistency via the depth-aware 3D attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate multi-view architectural images with consistent style and structural coherence from shoebox model inputs.</description>

      <title>From Architectural Sketch to Conceptual Representation: Using Structure-Aware Diffusion Model to Generate Renderings of School Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced rapidly, enabling the generation of renderings from architectural sketches. This progress has significantly improved the efficiency of communication and conceptual expression during the early stage of architectural design. However, generated images often lack the structural details from architects' sketches. While sketches typically emphasize the overall structure, crucial components such as windows and doors are often represented by simple lines or omitted entirely. For school buildings, it is essential to control architectural components, such as the shape and proportion of windows, as these factors directly influence the accuracy of the generated images in reflecting the architect's design intentions. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware diffusion model for architectural image generation to refine expressing design intentions through retrieval augmentation. Our framework utilizes architectural components to enhance the generation process, addressing the details that may be lacking in the sketches. These components provide clear spatial and structural details, improving the model's ability to interpret and generate architectural details. The refined sketches, combined with text prompts, are fed into the proposed structure-aware diffusion model to generate detailed and realistic school building images. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating architectural designs.</description>

      <title>Arc Blanc: a real time ocean simulation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oceans cover the vast majority of the Earth. Therefore, their simulation has many scientific, industrial and military interests, including computer graphics domain. By fully exploiting the multi-threading power of GPU and CPU, current state-of-the-art tools can achieve real-time ocean simulation, even if it is sometimes needed to reduce the physical realism for large scenes. Although most of the building blocks for implementing an ocean simulator are described in the literature, a clear explanation of how they interconnect is lacking. Hence, this paper proposes to bring all these components together, detailing all their interactions, in a comprehensive and fully described real-time framework that simulates the free ocean surface and the coupling between solids and fluid. This article also presents several improvements to enhance the physical realism of our model. The two main ones are: calculating the real-time velocity of ocean fluids at any depth; computing the input of the fluid to solid coupling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Gaussian highpass guided image filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guided image filtering (GIF) is a popular smoothing technique, in which an additional image is used as a structure guidance for noise removal with edge preservation. The original GIF and some of its subsequent improvements are derived from a two-parameter local affine model (LAM), where the filtering output is a local affine transformation of the guidance image, but the input image is not taken into account in the LAM formulation. In this paper, we first introduce a single-parameter Prior Model based on Gaussian (highpass/lowpass) Filtering (PM-GF), in which the filtering output is the sum of a weighted portion of Gaussian highpass filtering of the guidance image and Gaussian smoothing of the input image. In the PM-GF, the guidance structure determined by Gaussian highpass filtering is obviously transferred to the filtering output, thereby better revealing the structure transfer mechanism of guided filtering. Then we propose several Gaussian highpass GIFs (GH-GIFs) based on the PM-GF by emulating the original GIF and some improvements, i.e., using PM-GF instead of LAM in these GIFs. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed GIFs outperform their counterparts in several image processing applications.</description>

      <title>GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos. Check out our webpage! https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/GEN3C/</description>

      <title>Corotational Hinge-based Thin Plates/Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present six thin plate/shell models, derived from three distinct types of curvature operators formulated within the corotational frame, for simulating both rest-flat and rest-curved triangular meshes. Each curvature operator derives a curvature expression corresponding to both a plate model and a shell model. The corotational edge-based hinge model uses an edge-based stencil to compute directional curvature, while the corotational FVM hinge model utilizes a triangle-centered stencil, applying the finite volume method (FVM) to superposition directional curvatures across edges, yielding a generalized curvature. The corotational smoothed hinge model also employs a triangle-centered stencil but transforms directional curvatures into a generalized curvature based on a quadratic surface fit. All models assume small strain and small curvature, leading to constant bending energy Hessians, which benefit implicit integrators. Through quantitative benchmarks and qualitative elastodynamic simulations with large time steps, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of these models. Our contributions enhance the thin plate/shell library for use in both computer graphics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>ArcPro: Architectural Programs for Structured 3D Abstraction of Sparse Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce ArcPro, a novel learning framework built on architectural programs to recover structured 3D abstractions from highly sparse and low-quality point clouds. Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods. We further explore its potential to work with multi-view image and natural language inputs.</description>
