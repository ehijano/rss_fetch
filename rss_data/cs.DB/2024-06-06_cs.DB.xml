      <title>Applications of Information Inequalities to Database Theory Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper describes several applications of information inequalities to problems in database theory. The problems discussed include: upper bounds of a query's output, worst-case optimal join algorithms, the query domination problem, and the implication problem for approximate integrity constraints. The paper is self-contained: all required concepts and results from information inequalities are introduced here, gradually, and motivated by database problems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Technique for Query Plan Representation Based on Graph Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning representations for query plans play a pivotal role in machine learning-based query optimizers of database management systems. To this end, particular model architectures are proposed in the literature to transform the tree-structured query plans into representations with formats learnable by downstream machine learning models. However, existing research rarely compares and analyzes the query plan representation capabilities of these tree models and their direct impact on the performance of the overall optimizer. To address this problem, we perform a comparative study to explore the effect of using different state-of-the-art tree models on the optimizer's cost estimation and plan selection performance in relatively complex workloads. Additionally, we explore the possibility of using graph neural networks (GNNs) in the query plan representation task. We propose a novel tree model BiGG employing Bidirectional GNN aggregated by Gated recurrent units (GRUs) and demonstrate experimentally that BiGG provides significant improvements to cost estimation tasks and relatively excellent plan selection performance compared to the state-of-the-art tree models.</description>

      <title>A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Answering Graph Pattern Queries in Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of answering graph queries over incomplete knowledge graphs is gaining significant attention in the machine learning community. Neuro-symbolic models have emerged as a promising approach, combining good performance with high interpretability. These models utilize trained architectures to execute atomic queries and integrate modules that mimic symbolic query operators. However, most neuro-symbolic query processors are constrained to tree-like graph pattern queries. These queries admit a bottom-up execution with constant values or anchors at the leaves and the target variable at the root. While expressive, tree-like queries fail to capture critical properties in knowledge graphs, such as the existence of multiple edges between entities or the presence of triangles. We introduce a framework for answering arbitrary graph pattern queries over incomplete knowledge graphs, encompassing both cyclic queries and tree-like queries with existentially quantified leaves. These classes of queries are vital for practical applications but are beyond the scope of most current neuro-symbolic models. Our approach employs an approximation scheme that facilitates acyclic traversals for cyclic patterns, thereby embedding additional symbolic bias into the query execution process. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our framework performs competitively on three datasets, effectively handling cyclic queries through our approximation strategy. Additionally, it maintains the performance of existing neuro-symbolic models on anchored tree-like queries and extends their capabilities to queries with existentially quantified variables.</description>
