      <title>Universal Superconductivity in FeTe and All-Iron-Based Ferromagnetic Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetism (FM) and superconductivity (SC) are two of the most famous macroscopic quantum phenomena. However, nature normally does not allow SC and FM to coexist without significant degradation. Here, we introduce the first fully iron-based SC/FM heterostructures, composed of Fe(Te,Se) and Fe3GeTe2, and show that in this platform strong FM and high-temperature SC robustly coexist. We subsequently discover that chemical proximity effect from neighboring layers can universally drive the otherwise non-superconducting FeTe films into a SC state. This suggests that the ground state of FeTe is so close to the SC state that it could be driven in and out of the SC state with various other perturbations. Altogether, this shows that Fe-Te-based heterostructures provide a unique opportunity to manipulate magnetism, superconductivity and topological physics, paving the way toward new superconducting technologies.</description>

      <title>Creation, stabilization, and study at ambient pressure of pressure-induced superconductivity in Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of breakthroughs in superconductivity under high pressure, and considering that record critical temperatures (T$_c$s) across various systems have been achieved under high pressure, the primary challenge for higher Tc should no longer solely be to increase T$_c$ under extreme conditions but also to reduce, or ideally eliminate, the need for applied pressure in retaining pressure-induced or -enhanced superconductivity. The topological semiconductor Bi$_{0.5}$Sb$_{1.5}$Te$_3$ (BST) was chosen to demonstrate our approach to addressing this challenge and exploring its intriguing physics. Under pressures up to ~ 50 GPa, three superconducting phases (BST-I, -II, and -III) were observed. A superconducting phase in BST-I appears at ~ 4 GPa, without a structural transition, suggesting the possible topological nature of this phase. Using the pressure-quench protocol (PQP) recently developed by us, we successfully retained this pressure-induced phase at ambient pressure and revealed the bulk nature of the state. Significantly, this demonstrates recovery of a pressure-quenched sample from a diamond anvil cell at room temperature with the pressure-induced phase retained at ambient pressure. Other superconducting phases were retained in BST-II and -III at ambient pressure and subjected to thermal and temporal stability testing. Superconductivity was also found in BST with T$_c$ up to 10.2 K, the record for this compound series. While PQP maintains superconducting phases in BST at ambient pressure, both depressurization and PQP enhance its T$_c$, possibly due to microstructures formed during these processes, offering an added avenue to raise T$_c$. These findings are supported by our density-functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced structural and superconducting transitions in black arsenic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high-pressure Raman spectra and resistance measurements of black arsenic (b-As) up to 58 GPa, along with phonon density of states (DOS) and enthalpy calculations for four reported arsenic phases up to 50 GPa. It is found that metastable b-As transforms into gray arsenic (g-As) phase at a critical pressure of 1.51 GPa, followed by subsequent transitions to simple cubic arsenic (c-As) and incommensurate host-guest arsenic (hg-As) phases at 25.9 and 44.8 GPa, respectively. Superconductivity emerges above 25 GPa in the c-As phase, with the superconducting transition temperature ($T$$\rm_c$) remaining nearly a constant of 3 K. Upon further compression, $T$$\rm_c$ steeply increases to a higher value around 4.5 K in the incommensurate hg-As phase above 43 GPa. We use our results to update the structural and superconducting phase diagrams under pressure for the novel semiconductor, black arsenic.</description>

      <title>Majorana flat bands and anomalous proximity effects in $p$-wave magnet--superconductor hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band Majorana bound states of nodal $p$-wave superconductors give rise to striking electromagnetic anomalies, reflecting their high degree of degeneracy at the Fermi level. However, experimental investigations of these states have been hindered by the scarcity of materials exhibiting intrinsic $p$-wave superconductivity. In this Letter, we show that Majorana flat bands can emerge in a hybrid system consisting of a conventional superconductor and a $p$-wave magnet, a recently proposed class of unconventional magnets that possess a unique composite symmetry known as the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry. The degeneracy of the flat-band Majorana bound states is protected by chiral symmetry from the BDI symmetry class, which originates from the $[C_{2\perp}||\boldsymbol{t}]$ symmetry of the $p$-wave magnet. Furthermore, we predict the robust appearance of a zero-bias conductance peak in a dirty normal-metal--superconductor junction containing a $p$-wave magnet, which serves as an unambiguous signature of anomalous proximity effects associated with the Majorana flat bands.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows stepwise resistance dependencies on an applied magnetic field. These resistance steps result from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, exhibit unusual dependence on the magnitude of uniaxial strain $\epsilon$. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal -- strong topological insulator -- trivial dielectric and proves the appearance of the surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1\%$.</description>

      <title>Topological Josephson vortices at finite voltage bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of finite voltage bias on Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states in topological Josephson junctions with a vortex lattice. The voltage drives vortices into steady motion, squeezing the CdGM spectrum due to quasi-relativistic dispersion. A finite voltage range allows well-defined states, but beyond a critical breakdown voltage, the states collapse to zero energy and become sharply localized, marking a dynamical transition. Additionally, finite bias modifies selection rules for CdGM state transitions. Notably, in the steady-state regime, the time-averaged current vanishes, revealing a novel interplay between vortex dynamics and quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>From superconductivity to non-superconductivity in LiPdH: a first principle approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered structure of LiPdH was theoretically suggested to be a superconductor as a result of its larger electron-phonon coupling constant compared to that of PdH. However, the experimental results reported contrary findings, with no trace of superconductivity. We study the electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of the ambient pressure tetragonal phase of LiPdH ($P4/mmm$) within first principles density functional theory methods, both in the harmonic and anharmonic approximations for the lattice dynamics, and conclude that it does not show any superconducting behavior. High-pressure crystal structure prediction calculations indicate that no structural transition is expected to occur under pressure up to 100 GPa in LiPdH. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that increasing pressure reduces the density of states at the Fermi surface and consequently weakens electron-phonon interactions, leading to a further suppression of the superconducting critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection from chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating mirrors with magnetic components is crucial for constructing chiral optical cavities, which provide tunable platforms for time-reversal-asymmetric light-matter interactions. Here, we introduce single-crystal circular-polarization-selective mirrors based on chiral superconductors, which break time-reversal symmetry by themselves eliminating the need for additional components. We show that a circular-polarization-selective perfect reflection (CSPR) occurs for strong-coupling superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover regime or beyond if the optical Hall conductivity is significant in the unit of conductivity quantum per unit layer, $e^2/ha_z$, where $a_z$ is the lattice constant along the surface normal. While the optical Hall conductivity in chiral superconductors is typically tiny, we classify three routes to obtain a large value. We demonstrate the significant optical Hall conductivity and the resulting CSPR with two examples: (1) superconductivity in doped quantum Hall insulators and (2) chiral pairing that preserves the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the weak-pairing limit. We also discuss the application of our theory to the recently discovered chiral superconducting phase in rhombohedral graphene. Our theory reveals the potential of these classes of chiral superconductors as promising elements for building high-quality-factor terahertz chiral cavities.</description>

      <title>Superconducting-insulating phase transition in pressurized Ba1-xKxBiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first observation of a pressure-induced transition from a superconducting (SC) to an insulating (I) phase in single-crystal Ba1-xKxBiO3 (x = 0.4, 0.43, 0.52, and 0.58) superconductors. X-ray diffraction measurements conducted at 20 K reveal a direct relationship between this SC-I transition and a pressure-induced distortion of crystal structure. With increasing pressure, the lattice parameters a and c of the ambient-pressure superconducting tetragonal (T) phase are compressed continuously below a critical pressure (Pc1), wherein the pressure (P) dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) displays a small variation. However, upon further compression, the lattice of the compressed T phase displays an anisotropic change, and Tc shows a monotonous decrease. When the pressure reaches Pc2 (Pc2 &gt; Pc1), the compressed T phase collapses along the c axis, followed by the disappearance of superconductivity and the appearance of the insulating phase. This SC-I transition is fully reversible, with the critical pressure increasing alongside K doping concentration. These findings are strikingly similar to the SC-I transition observed in hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors under pressure. Identifying their commonalities could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie high- Tc superconductivity in these two oxide superconductors with a perovskite structure.</description>

      <title>Investigations of key issues on the reproducibility of high-Tc superconductivity emerging from compressed La3Ni2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12361v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the signatures of superconductivity near 80 K have been discovered in the single crystal of La3Ni2O7 under pressure, which makes it a new candidate of the high-temperature superconductors dominated by 3d transition elements after the cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors. However, there are several critical questions that have been perplexing the scientific community. These questions include (1) what factors contribute to the inconsistent reproducibility of the experimental results? (2) what is the fundamental nature of pressure-induced superconductivity: bulk or non-bulk (filamentary-like)? (3) where does the superconducting phase locate within the sample if it is filamentary-like? (4) is the oxygen content important for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity? In this study, we employ comprehensive high-pressure techniques to address these crucial issues. Through our modulated ac susceptibility measurements, we are the first to find that the superconductivity in this nickelate is filamentary-like. Our scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations suggest that the filamentary-like superconductivity most likely emerges at the interface between the La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 phases. By tuning the oxygen content on the polycrystalline La3Ni2O7, we also find that the oxygen content plays vital role for developing and stabilizing its superconductivity. The upper and lower bounds of the oxygen content are 7.35 and 6.89, respectively. Our results provide not only new insights into understanding the puzzling issues in this material, but also significant information for achieving a better understanding on the superconductivity of this material.</description>

      <title>Unconventional p-wave and finite-momentum superconductivity induced by altermagnetism through the formation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnet is an exotic class of magnetic materials wherein the Fermi surface exhibits a momentum-dependent spin-splitting while maintaining a net zero magnetization. Previous studies have shown that this distinctive spin-splitting can induce chiral p-wave superconductors or Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconducting states carrying finite momentum. However, the underlying mechanisms of such unconventional superconductivities remain elusive. Here, we propose that the formation of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) through the exchange field can play a significant role in such phenomena. Through a systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with the d-wave spin-splitting induced by the exchange field, as observed in RuO2, we demonstrate that the formation of the BFS suppresses conventional spin-singlet superconducting states with s-wave characteristics. In contrast, the chiral p-wave state maintains a fully gapped spectrum without the Fermi surface, thereby becoming the ground state in the strong field regime. In the intermediate regime, we find that the FF state becomes the predominant state through the optimization of available channels for Cooper pairing. Moreover, we illustrate how the prevalence of the chiral p-wave and FF states over the s-wave state changes under the variation of the field strength or chemical potential. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential pathways for realizing sought-after topological p-wave superconductivity and finite momentum pairing facilitated by altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Phases of three-dimensional $d$-wave superconductors with two attractive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional $d$-wave ($j=2$) superconducting state may result from Cooper pairing in channels with different angular momenta and spin, such as $(l=0, s=2)$ or $(l=2, s=0)$. We consider spin-3/2 Luttinger fermions in the limit of small spin-orbit coupling parameter and with weak attractive interactions in both of these channels, and demonstrate that the stable $d$-wave superconducting phase of the system below critical temperature depends critically on the ratio of two interactions. When a weak inversion-breaking term in the kinetic energy is included, all three of the real, ferromagnetic, and cyclic phases can be realized within a narrow range around unit ratio. The result shows how models of multicomponent superconductors can be surprisingly sensitive to precise values of some of its parameters and display radically different superconducting ground states with their variation.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Instability of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under Zeeman Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the evolution and instability of the Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS) in the spherical $j=3/2$ model under a Zeeman field. The applied field induces a pronounced expansion in the BFS with $j_z = \pm 3/2$ component. Such behavior can be detected by spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Interestingly, the Pauli susceptibility exhibits behavior that appears discontinuous just below the transition temperature at zero field, even though it is a second-order transition. This is due to spontaneous magnetization. Furthermore, the analysis of the bogolon correlations in the superconducting phase suggests the possibility of the chiral $p$- or $f$-wave bogolon pairing instabilities rather than the Pomeranchuk instability. These chiral states coexist with the chiral $d$-wave superconducting state, spontaneously break inversion symmetry, and lead to the disappearance of the torus-shaped BFS structure.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fr\"ohlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</description>
