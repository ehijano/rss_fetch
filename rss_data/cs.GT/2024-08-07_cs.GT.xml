      <title>Nash Equilibrium in Games on Graphs with Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games with incomplete preferences are an important model for studying rational decision-making in scenarios where players face incomplete information about their preferences and must contend with incomparable outcomes. We study the problem of computing Nash equilibrium in a subclass of two-player games played on graphs where each player seeks to maximally satisfy their (possibly incomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We characterize the Nash equilibrium and prove its existence in scenarios where player preferences are fully aligned, partially aligned, and completely opposite, in terms of the well-known solution concepts of sure winning and Pareto efficiency. When preferences are partially aligned, we derive conditions under which a player needs cooperation and demonstrate that the Nash equilibria depend not only on the preference alignment but also on whether the players need cooperation to achieve a better outcome and whether they are willing to cooperate.We illustrate the theoretical results by solving a mechanism design problem for a drone delivery scenario.</description>

      <title>Centralization in Attester-Proposer Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Execution Tickets and Execution Auctions dramatically increase centralization in the market for block proposals, even without multi-block MEV concerns. Previous analyses have insufficiently or incorrectly modeled the interaction between ahead-of-time auctions and just-in-time (JIT) auctions. We study a model where bidders compete in an execution auction ahead of time, and then the winner holds a JIT auction to resell the proposal rights when the slot arrives. During the execution auction, bidders only know the distribution of their valuations. Bidders then draw values from their distributions and compete in the JIT auction. We show that a bidder who wins the execution auction is substantially advantaged in the JIT auction since they can set a reserve price higher than their own realized value for the slot to increase their revenue. As a result, there is a strong centralizing force in the execution auction, which allows the ex-ante strongest bidder to win the execution auction every time, and similarly gives them the strongest incentive to buy up all the tickets. Similar results trivially apply if the resale market is imperfect, since that only reinforces the advantages of the ex-ante strong buyer. To reiterate, these results do not require the bidders to employ multi-block MEV strategies, although if they did, it would likely amplify the centralizing effects.</description>

      <title>Cooperation and Control in Delegation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many settings of interest involving humans and machines -- from virtual personal assistants to autonomous vehicles -- can naturally be modelled as principals (humans) delegating to agents (machines), which then interact with each other on their principals' behalf. We refer to these multi-principal, multi-agent scenarios as delegation games. In such games, there are two important failure modes: problems of control (where an agent fails to act in line their principal's preferences) and problems of cooperation (where the agents fail to work well together). In this paper we formalise and analyse these problems, further breaking them down into issues of alignment (do the players have similar preferences?) and capabilities (how competent are the players at satisfying those preferences?). We show -- theoretically and empirically -- how these measures determine the principals' welfare, how they can be estimated using limited observations, and thus how they might be used to help us design more aligned and cooperative AI systems.</description>

      <title>On Connected Strongly-Proportional Cake-Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly dividing a divisible heterogeneous resource, also known as a cake, among a set of agents who may have different entitlements. We characterize the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation -- one in which every agent receives a contiguous piece worth strictly more than their proportional share. The characterization is supplemented with an algorithm that determines its existence using O(n * 2^n) queries. We devise a simpler characterization for agents with strictly positive valuations and with equal entitlements, and present an algorithm to determine the existence of such an allocation using O(n^2) queries. We provide matching lower bounds in the number of queries for both algorithms. When a connected strongly-proportional allocation exists, we show that it can also be computed using a similar number of queries. We also consider the problem of deciding the existence of a connected allocation of a cake in which each agent receives a piece worth a small fixed value more than their proportional share, and the problem of deciding the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation of a pie.</description>
