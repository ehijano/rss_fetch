      <title>On the Efficacy of Shorting Corporate Bonds as a Tail Risk Hedging Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: United States (US) IG bonds typically trade at modest spreads over US Treasuries, reflecting the credit risk tied to a corporation's default potential. During market crises, IG spreads often widen and liquidity tends to decrease, likely due to increased credit risk (evidenced by higher IG Credit Default Index spreads) and the necessity for asset holders like mutual funds to liquidate assets, including IG credits, to manage margin calls, bolster cash reserves, or meet redemptions. These credit and liquidity premia occur during market drawdowns and tend to move non-linearly with the market. The research herein refers to this non-linearity (during periods of drawdown) as downside convexity, and shows that this market behavior can effectively be captured through a short position established in IG Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
  The following document details the construction of three signals: Momentum, Liquidity, and Credit, that can be used in combination to signal entries and exits into short IG positions to hedge a typical active bond portfolio (such as PIMIX). A dynamic hedge initiates the short when signals jointly correlate and point to significant future hedged return. The dynamic hedge removes when the short position's predicted hedged return begins to mean revert. This systematic hedge largely avoids IG Credit drawdowns, lowers absolute and downside risk, increases annualised returns and achieves higher Sortino ratios compared to the benchmark funds. The method is best suited to high carry, high active risk funds like PIMIX, though it also generalises to more conservative funds similar to DODIX.</description>

      <title>Causal Portfolio Optimization: Principles and Sensitivity-Based Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05743</link>

Abstract: Fundamental and necessary principles for achieving efficient portfolio optimization based on asset and diversification dynamics are presented. The Commonality Principle is a necessary and sufficient condition for identifying optimal drivers of a portfolio in terms of its diversification dynamics. The proof relies on the Reichenbach Common Cause Principle, along with the fact that the sensitivities of portfolio constituents with respect to the common causal drivers are themselves causal. A conformal map preserves idiosyncratic diversification from the unconditional setting while optimizing systematic diversification on an embedded space of these sensitivities. Causal methodologies for combinatorial driver selection are presented, such as the use of Bayesian networks and correlation-based algorithms from Reichenbach's principle. Limitations of linear models in capturing causality are discussed, and included for completeness alongside more advanced models such as neural networks. Portfolio optimization methods are presented that map risk from the sensitivity space to other risk measures of interest. Finally, the work introduces a novel risk management framework based on Common Causal Manifolds, including both theoretical development and experimental validation. The sensitivity space is predicted along the common causal manifold, which is modeled as a causal time system. Sensitivities are forecasted using SDEs calibrated to data previously extracted from neural networks to move along the manifold via its tangent bundles. An optimization method is then proposed that accumulates information across future predicted tangent bundles on the common causal time system manifold. It aggregates sensitivity-based distance metrics along the trajectory to build a comprehensive sensitivity distance matrix. This matrix enables trajectory-wide optimal diversification, taking into account future dynamics.</description>
