      <title>The Shifting Landscape of Vaccine Discourse: Insights From a Decade of Pre- to Post-COVID-19 Vaccine Posts on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study English-language vaccine discourse in social media posts, specifically posts on X (formerly Twitter), in seven years before the COVID-19 outbreak (2013 to 2019) and three years after the outbreak was first reported (2020 to 2022). Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.</description>

      <title>From Toxicity to Conformity: Adaptive user behavior to social norms in Telegram communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Toxic and antisocial user behavior on social media platforms has received considerable scholarly attention due to its detrimental effects on society. This study takes a holistic perspective on the phenomenon of online toxicity by investigating the impact of local community norms on toxic expression. By using six large-scale datasets, comprising over 500 million Telegram messages collected between 2015 and 2024, we analyze toxic user behavior across multiple chats and languages. We introduce a methodological framework that models user adaptation through a conformity index, capturing conformist, anti-conformist, and independent behavioral tendencies. Our findings show that most users tend to conform to local normative environments, adjusting their toxicity to match the toxicity levels of the chats in which they participate. These patterns are consistent across datasets and languages, suggesting that community norms and social influence play a decisive role in shaping user behavior online. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to these norms, in terms of increased user participation in chats, is associated with a stronger tendency toward conformity with the surrounding social contexts. Collectively, these findings contribute to a deeper understanding of toxic online behavior and highlight the importance of contextualized approaches to content moderation.</description>

      <title>Modeling memory in time-respecting paths on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human close-range proximity interactions are the key determinant for spreading processes like knowledge diffusion, norm adoption, and infectious disease transmission. These dynamical processes can be modeled with time-respecting paths on temporal networks. Here, we propose a framework to quantify memory in time-respecting paths and evaluate it on several empirical datasets encoding proximity between humans collected in different settings. Our results show strong memory effects, robust across settings, model parameters, and statistically significant when compared to memoryless null models. We further propose a generative model to create synthetic temporal graphs with memory and use it to show that memory in time-respecting paths decreases the diffusion speed, affecting the dynamics of spreading processes on temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics are associated with misinformation sharing activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics-average daily tweet count, and account age-can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects differ depending on the number of accounts a user follows. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sentiment Discrepancy for Multimodal Sentiment Detection via Semantics Completion and Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of social media posts in recent years, the need to detect sentiments in multimodal (image-text) content has grown rapidly. Since posts are user-generated, the image and text from the same post can express different or even contradictory sentiments, leading to potential \textbf{sentiment discrepancy}. However, existing works mainly adopt a single-branch fusion structure that primarily captures the consistent sentiment between image and text. The ignorance or implicit modeling of discrepant sentiment results in compromised unimodal encoding and limited performance. In this paper, we propose a semantics Completion and Decomposition (CoDe) network to resolve the above issue. In the semantics completion module, we complement image and text representations with the semantics of the in-image text, helping bridge the sentiment gap. In the semantics decomposition module, we decompose image and text representations with exclusive projection and contrastive learning, thereby explicitly capturing the discrepant sentiment between modalities. Finally, we fuse image and text representations by cross-attention and combine them with the learned discrepant sentiment for final classification. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoDe and the effectiveness of each proposed module.</description>

      <title>Testing Hypotheses from the Social Approval Theory of Online Hate: An Analysis of 110 Million Messages from Parler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examined how online hate is motivated by receiving social approval via Walther's (2024) social approval theory of online hate, which argues (H1a) more signals of social approval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as social approval increases, hate speech becomes more extreme. Using 110 million messages from Parler (2018-2021), we observed the number of upvotes received on a hate speech post was unassociated with hate speech in one's next post and during the next month, three-months, and six-months. The number of upvotes received on (extreme) hate speech comments, however, was positively associated with (extreme) hate speech during the next week, month, three-months, and six-months. Between-person effects revealed an average positive relationship between social approval and hate speech production at all time intervals. For comments, social approval linked more strongly to online hate than social disapproval. Social approval is a critical mechanism facilitating online hate propagation.</description>
