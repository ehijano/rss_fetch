      <title>Residual-Weighted Decomposition of Positive Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an iterative rank-one decomposition scheme for positive operators on a Hilbert space based on a residual-weighted congruence update. At each step the operator is compressed along a chosen unit vector while remaining inside the positive cone, and the resulting map defines a monotone dynamical system on the cone of positive operators. We prove that the associated residuals admit a canonical telescoping decomposition into rank-one terms and a limiting positive operator, and we identify this limit together with an exact energy identity expressing the defect between the initial and limiting operators as a convergent series of rank-one contributions. In the case where the iteration exhausts the operator, the residual directions form a Parseval frame for the natural range space, yielding a constructive procedure that produces Parseval frames without spectral calculus. We further solve the inverse problem by characterizing those decreasing chains with rank-one steps that arise from such dynamics via an intrinsic normalization condition involving the Moore-Penrose inverse. For trace-class operators we obtain a scalar energy identity and show that mild greedy or density conditions on the chosen directions guarantee exhaustion. An application to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces illustrates the abstract results.</description>

      <title>Semi-inner product and angles in Schatten ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schatten $p$-class ideals for $p &gt;1$ as semi-inner product spaces in the sense of Giles and Lumer. Within this framework, we explore several geometric and analytic notions such as Birkhoff-James orthogonality, $p$-parallelism, and related properties that naturally arise when these structures are interpreted through the lens of the associated semi-inner product. Furthermore, we introduce a novel notion of angle adapted to this context, which generalizes and unifies existing angle definitions in normed spaces. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the geometry of the $p$-Schatten class and offer new perspectives on operator behavior in semi-inner product spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering questions raised in \cite{Leonetti, Uzcategui} we characterize ideals $\mathcal I\subseteq \mathcal P(\omega)$ such that $c_{0,\mathcal I}$ is complemented in $\ell_\infty$ as exactly those ideals for which the space $K_{\mathcal I}= \mathsf{Stone}(\mathcal P(\omega)/\mathcal I)$ is approximable, i.e., the unit ball of the space $M(K_{\mathcal I})$ of signed Radon measures on $K_\mathcal I$ is separable in the weak* topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the essential criteria for the hyponormality and quasinormality of the unbounded Toeplitz operator $T_{\varphi}$ with non-harmonic symbol, acting on the Fock-Sobolev space $F^{2, m}(\mathbb{C})$. The study shows that quasinormality does not inherently imply hyponormality of unbounded Toeplitz operator with non-harmonic symbols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we improve Besov's recent result about upper estimates for the entropy numbers of Sobolev classes on a H\"{o}lder domain (in the case when the definition of the Sobolev class involves all partial derivatives of order $r$). We also obtain upper estimates for the Kolmogorov, linear and the Gelfand widths.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and nonlinear geometries of Banach spaces and their interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book discusses the interactions between the (nonlinear) metric structure of Banach spaces and their linear asymptotic behavior. The overarching problem is to understand how the various linear structures of a Banach space are preserved under certain nonlinear maps. The first chapters contain what are by now classical results to study the most basic and fundamental rigidity problems: the Lipschitz or uniform classification of Banach spaces. The other chapters form the main contribution of this book. The intended goal is to cover the work of many researchers, in particular their discoveries from the past 25 years, trying to understand how asymptotic properties of Banach spaces are preserved under several essential notions of nonlinear (bi-Lipschitz, coarse-Lipschitz, coarse or uniform) embeddings. This is part of a broader program called the Kalton program. This program, inspired by the Ribe program, seeks to uncover purely metric characterizations of asymptotic properties of Banach spaces. Many of these charaterizations are closely connected to the geometry of families of metric graphs (trees, Hamming graphs, diamond graphs, interlacing graphs) thus this book is also about the geometric structure of those graphs.</description>

      <title>Effros' theorem on transitive group actions with a glimpse into descriptive set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this note is to prove a version of a celebrated theorem of Effros about transitive group actions in a non-metrizable setting, these parts have been formalized and verified with Lean by Lara Toledano. We do not claim any originality since the given proof is in fact very close to one of van Mill. Our presentation is however completely self-contained and may serve as an appetizer to descriptive set theory. It also contains a few results about Suslin spaces (continuous images of separable completely metrizable spaces, which are often called analytic) which are extremely useful in measure theory.</description>

      <title>A Beginner-Friendly Note on Maximal Monotone Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self-contained and introductory account of some basic functional analytic tools needed to understand maximal monotone operators in Hilbert spaces. We review domains of (possibly unbounded) operators, closed sets and closed operators, and provide concrete examples of bounded and unbounded operators in both finite and infinite dimensions. We then explain in detail a fundamental result of Br\'ezis: if $A$ is a maximal monotone linear operator, then its domain is dense, $A$ is closed, and $(I+\lambda A)^{-1}$ is a non-expansive mapping for every $\lambda&gt;0$. The Banach fixed point theorem (contraction mapping principle) is stated and used as a key ingredient in the analysis. The presentation is aimed at beginning graduate students and readers seeing these notions for the first time.</description>

Abstract: In analogy to a recent result by V. Fonf, M. Lin, and P. Wojtaszczyk, we prove the following characterizations of a Banach space $X$ with a basis. (i) $X$ is finite-dimensional if and only if every bounded, uniformly continuous, mean ergodic semigroup on $X$ is uniformly mean ergodic. (ii) $X$ is reflexive if and only if every bounded strongly continuous semigroup is mean ergodic if and only if every bounded uniformly continuous semigroup on $X$ is mean ergodic.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Proof Of The Josefson-Nissenzweig Theorem For Banach Spaces C(KxL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [8] probabilistic methods, in particular a variant of the Weak Law of Large Numbers related to the Bernoulli distribution, have been used to show that for every infinite compact spaces K and L there exists a sequence $(\mu_n)$ of normalized signed measures on $K\times L$ with finite supports which converges to $0$ with respect to the weak topology of the dual Banach space $C(K\times L).$ In this paper, we return to this construction, limiting ourselves only to elementary combinatorial calculus. The main efects of this construction are additional information about the measures $\mu_n$, this is particularly clearly seen (among the others) in the resulting inequalities
  $$\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} &lt;\sup_{A\times B\subset X\times Y} |\mu_n(A\times B)|&lt;\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},$$
  $n\in\mathbb{N}$, with $\mu_n(f) \to_n 0$ for every $f\in C(X \times Y);$ where X and Y are arbitrary Tychonoff spaces containing infinite compact subsets, respectively. As an application we explicitly describe for Banach spaces $C(X\times Y)$ some complemented subspaces isomorphic to $c_0$. This result generalizes the classical theorem of Cembranos and Freniche, which states that for every infinite compact spaces K and L, the Banach space $C(K\times L)$ contains a complemented copy of the Banach space $c_0.$</description>

      <title>Wetterich's Equation and its Boundary Conditions for Radon Measures on Locally Convex Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wetterich's equation and corresponding flows of effective average actions are used frequently in theoretical physics to study the properties of quantum field theories. Under appropriate conditions, Wetterich's equation also holds for Radon measures on locally convex spaces and the domain of the effective average action is the Lusin affine kernel of the measure. The resulting flow interpolates between the convex conjugate of the cumulant-generating function of the measure in question and its (generalised) Onsager-Machlup function. The underlying metric of the latter is induced by a family of measurable bilinear functionals that can be understood as bilinear versions of Lusin measurable linear functionals.</description>

      <title>Upper Approximation Bounds for Neural Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural oscillators, originating from the second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs), have demonstrated competitive performance in stably learning causal mappings between long-term sequences or continuous temporal functions. However, theoretically quantifying the capacities of their neural network architectures remains a significant challenge. In this study, the neural oscillator consisting of a second-order ODE followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) is considered. Its upper approximation bound for approximating causal and uniformly continuous operators between continuous temporal function spaces and that for approximating uniformly asymptotically incrementally stable second-order dynamical systems are derived. The established proof method of the approximation bound for approximating the causal continuous operators can also be directly applied to state-space models consisting of a linear time-continuous complex recurrent neural network followed by an MLP. Theoretical results reveal that the approximation error of the neural oscillator for approximating the second-order dynamical systems scales polynomially with the reciprocals of the widths of two utilized MLPs, thus mitigating the curse of parametric complexity. The decay rates of two established approximation error bounds are validated through two numerical cases. These results provide a robust theoretical foundation for the effective application of the neural oscillator in science and engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every nearly spherical manifold can be realized as the volume-preserving image of a round sphere, via the Brenier-McCann optimal transport map. This theorem extends Caffarelli's contraction theorem to nearly spherical manifolds and yields, as a corollary, a proof of a perturbative form of Milman's conjecture. The proof is based on a novel stability result for optimal transport maps on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Fran\c{c}a [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.</description>

      <title>Solutions to Sobolev Supercritical Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations on an Annulus via a Hopf Reduction Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of positive solutions with a prescribed mass for nonlinear Schrodinger equations on an annulus, possibly in the Sobolev supercritical regime. A reduction method based on the Hopf fibration is used to transform the problem into a lower-dimensional one. We obtain a new mass critical threshold and we show that in the new mass subcritical or critical regimes there exists a positive solution which corresponds to a global minimizer, while in the mass supercritical regime, there exists two positive solutions which correspond to a local minimizer and a mountain pass solution respectively. Some other problems are also discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>The Lebesgue constant for uniform approximation of differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we address the problem of uniform approximation of differential forms starting from weak data defined by integration on rectifiable sets. We study approximation schemes defined by the projection operator L given by either generalized weighted least squares or interpolation. We show that, under a natural measure theoretic condition, the norm of such operator equals the Lebesgue constant of the problem. We finally estimate how the Lebesgue constant varies under the action of smooth mappings from the reference domain to a physical one, as is customarily done e.g. in finite element method.</description>

      <title>The sharp constants in the real anisotropic Littlewood's $\boldsymbol{4 / 3}$ inequality and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real anisotropic Littlewood's $4 / 3$ inequality is an extension of a famous result obtained in 1930 by J. E. Littlewood. It asserts that, for $a , b \in ( 0 , \infty )$, the following conditions are equivalent:
  $\bullet$ There is an optimal constant $\mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{R} } \in [ 1 , \infty )$ such that \[ \Biggl ( \, \sum_{ k = 1 }^{ \infty } \biggl ( \, \sum_{ j = 1 }^{ \infty } \bigl \lvert A \bigl ( \boldsymbol{e}^{ (k) } , \boldsymbol{e}^{ (j) } \bigr ) \bigr \rvert^a \biggr )^{ \frac{b}{a} } \Biggr )^{ \frac{1}{b} } \leq \mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{R} } \cdot \lVert A \rVert \]
  for every continuous bilinear form $A \colon c_0 \times c_0 \to \mathbb{R}$.
  $\bullet$ The values $a , b$ satisfy $a , b \geq 1$ and $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} \leq \frac{3}{2}$.
  Several authors have obtained the values of $\mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{R} }$ for diverse pairs $( a , b )$. In this paper we provide the complete list of such optimal values, as well as new estimates for $\mathsf{L}_{ a , b }^{ \mathbb{C} }$ (the analog for continuous $\mathbb{C}$-bilinear forms), which are exact in several cases. As an application we prove, in terms of the values $\mathsf{L}_{ 1 , r }^{ \mathbb{C} }$, a variant of Khinchin's inequality for Steinhaus variables, and we provide estimates for the optimal $( q , s )$-cotype constants of the spaces $\ell_1 ( \mathbb{K} )$ (with $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) in terms of the values $\mathsf{L}_{ 1 , q }^{ \mathbb{R} }$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent discovery of Eldan and Gross states that there exists a universal $C&gt;0$ such that for all Boolean functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$,
  $$
  \int_{\{-1,1\}^n}\sqrt{s_f(x)}d\mu(x) \ge C\text{Var}(f)\sqrt{\log \left(1+\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Inf}_j(f)^2}\right)}
  $$
  where $s_f(x)$ is the sensitivity of $f$ at $x$, $\text{Var}(f)$ is the variance of $f$, $\text{Inf}_j(f)$ is the influence of $f$ along the $j$-th variable, and $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure. In this note, we give an alternative proof that applies to biased discrete hypercube, and spaces having positive Ricci curvature lower bounds in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For time-frequency localization operators, related to the short-time Fourier transform, with symbol $R\Omega$, we work out the exact large $R$ eigenvalue behavior for rotationally invariant $\Omega$ and conjecture that the same relation holds for all scaled symbols $R \Omega$ as long as the window is the standard Gaussian. Specifically, we conjecture that the $k$-th eigenvalue of the localization operator with symbol $R\Omega$ converges to $\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc}\big( \sqrt{2\pi}\frac{k-R^2|\Omega|}{R|\partial \Omega|} \big)$ as $R \to \infty$. To support the conjecture, we compute the eigenvalues of discrete frame multipliers with various symbols using LTFAT and find that they agree with the behavior of the conjecture to a large degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1941, G. Gr\"unwald proved the convergence of a sequence of operators constructed using classical Lagrange interpolation at Chebyshev nodes. In this work, we establish a perturbed version of Gr\"unwald's result, thereby extending the class of admissible nodal points. Specifically, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence when the interpolation nodes are of the form {cos eta_k} for k = 1, ..., n, where {eta_k} is a general sequence. We refer to these operators as Gr\"unwald operators. In particular, we prove a convergence result when {eta_k} is equidistant and uniformly distributed. We establish a Voronovskaja-type estimate for the convergence of these operators and derive quantitative results using modulus of continuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the Krein-Rutman theory for semigroups of positive operators in a Banach lattice framework and we provide some very general, efficient and handy results with constructive estimates about: the existence of a solution to the first eigentriplet problem; the geometry of the principal eigenvalue problem; the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector with possible constructive rate of convergence. This abstract theory is motivated and illustrated by several examples of differential, integro-differential and integral operators. In particular, we revisit the first eigenvalue problem and the asymptotic stability of the first eigenvector for: some parabolic equations in a bounded domain and in the whole space; some transport equations in a bounded or unbounded domain, including some growth-fragmentation models and some kinetic models; the kinetic Fokker-Planck equation in the torus and in the whole space; some mutation-selection models.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetEDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetEDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also investigate the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of an extended Koopman operator within a framework of a rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetEDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $p\in[1,\infty)$ and a bounded open set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ with Lipschitz boundary, we study the $\Gamma$-convergence of the weighted fractional seminorm \[ [u]_{s,p,f}^p = \int_{\mathbb R^d} \int_{\mathbb R^d} \frac{|\tilde{u}(x)- \tilde{u}(y)|^p}{\|x-y\|^{d+sp}}\,f(x)\,f(y)\,\mathrm{d} x\,\mathrm{d} y \] as $s\to1^-$ for $u\in L^p(\Omega)$, where $\tilde{u}=u$ on $\Omega$ and $\tilde{u}=0$ on $\mathbb R^d\setminus\Omega$. Assuming that $(f_s)_{s\in(0,1)}\subset L^\infty(\mathbb R^d;[0,\infty))$ and $f\in\mathrm{Lip}_b(\mathbb R^d;(0,\infty))$ are such that $f_s\to f$ in $L^\infty(\mathbb R^d)$ as $s\to1^-$, we show that $(1-s)[u]_{s,p,f_s}$ $\Gamma$-converges to the Dirichlet $p$-energy weighted by $f^2$. In the case $p=2$, we also prove the convergence of the corresponding gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Infinite Interacting Brownian Motions and EVI Gradient Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition under which the time-marginal law of $\mu$-reversible infinite interacting Brownian motions is characterised as the steepest gradient descent of the relative entropy in the Wasserstein space in the sense of evolution variational inequality (EVI). This is an infinite-dimensional generalisation of Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto/Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e theory. Consequently, the configuration space (the space of locally finite point measures) endowed with the reversible measure $\mu$ is an RCD space and the time-marginal law is identified to the heat flow on this space. Our result covers the infinite-dimensional Dyson Brownian motion with bulk and soft-edge limits; the latter yields Airy line ensemble as its stationary process, a central object in KPZ universality. Our result therefore provides an optimal transport characterisation of these models as Wasserstein gradient flows, and establishes a range of new functional inequalities (HWI, distorted Brunn-Minkowski, dimension-free Harnack and many others) as a corollary. As an application, we discover the new phenomena, dynamical number rigidity and dynamical tail triviality, that the time-marginal law possesses number rigidity and tail triviality for every time $t&gt;0$, revealing a propagation of random crystal and extremal structures by the Dyson Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>The Fourth-Moment Theorem on Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish conditions ensuring convergence in distribution of a sequence admitting a Wiener-It\^o chaos representation to a nondegenerate Gaussian measure on a separable Hilbert space. Our first main result shows that, assuming convergence of the associated covariance operators in the trace-class norm, a sequence lying in a fixed Wiener-It\^o chaos converges in distribution if and only if its fourth weak moments converge to the corresponding Gaussian moments. For general sequences with infinite chaos expansions, we derive analogous sufficient conditions for convergence in distribution. A key ingredient in our approach is a Stein-Malliavin bound formulated with respect to a distance that metrizes weak convergence of probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. The results are infinite-dimensional extensions of the classical real-valued Fourth-Moment Theorem of Nualart and Peccati [Ann. Probab. 33, 177-193 (2005)]. Our work builds upon the work by Bourguin and Campese [Electron. J. Probab. 25, 1-30 (2020)] who claimed a Fourth-Moment Theorem in separable Hilbert spaces. However, a recent work by Bassetti, Bourguin, Campese, and Peccati [arXiv:2509.13427 (2025)] showed that the distance employed in the former article does not metrize weak convergence of probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. Consequently, the conditions stated in Bourguin and Campese are not sufficient to recover a valid Fourth-Moment Theorem in the Hilbert-space setting.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for Isoperimetry and Its Equivalence to Nonlinear Log-Sobolev Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviations principle (which concerns sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on product Riemannian manifolds $M^{n}$ equipped with product probability measures $\nu^{\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying curvature-dimension bound $\mathrm{CD}(0,\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics for the isoperimetric profile, which shows a precise equivalence between these asymptotic isoperimetric inequalities and nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities. It is observed that the product of two relative entropy typical sets (or empirically typical sets) forms an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. The proofs in this paper integrate tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.</description>

      <title>Detecting the real line among one-parametric topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a topological group is isomorphic to the real line if and only if it is a one-parameteric, metrizable, and not monothetic. This result is used in the authors' other paper to prove that one-parametric groups in strictly convex metric group all are topologically isomorphic to the real line. The example of the Bohr topology on the real line demonstrates that metrizability is an essential assumption in our first claim. This motivates further study to characterize the Bohr group topology as well as detect a monothetic one-parametric topological groups in a non-metrizable setting. Both issues are addressed and resolved in the present paper.</description>

      <title>The Sobolev space $W_2^{1/2}$: Simultaneous improvement of functions by a homeomorphism of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that for every continuous real-valued function $f$ on the circle $\mathbb T=\mathbb R/2\pi\mathbb Z$ there exists a change of variable, i.e., a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$, such that the superposition $f\circ h$ is in the Sobolev space $W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. We obtain new results on simultaneous improvement of functions by a single change of variable in relation to the space $W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. The main result is as follows: there does not exist a self-homeomorphism $h$ of $\mathbb T$ such that $f\circ h\in W_2^{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ for every $f\in \mathrm{Lip}_{1/2}(\mathbb T)$. Here $\mathrm{Lip}_{1/2}(\mathbb T)$ is the class of all functions on $\mathbb T$ satisfying the Lipschitz condition of order $1/2$.</description>

      <title>A nontrivial uniform algebra regular on the Cantor set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a nontrivial uniform algebra that is logmodular and regular on the Cantor set. As a consequence, we obtain that for every compact metrizable space X without isolated points there exists a nontrivial essential uniform algebra that is logmodular and regular on X. In particular, there exists a nontrivial essential uniform algebra that is logmodular and regular on the closed unit interval. Our algebras seem to be the first known uniform algebras that are regular on a metrizable space but are not normal.</description>
