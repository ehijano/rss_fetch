      <title>On feedback stabilisation for the Cahn-Hilliard equation and its numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stabilisation of solutions to the Cahn-Hilliard equation towards a given trajectory by means of a finite-dimensional static output feedback mechanism. Exponential stabilisation of the controlled state around the target trajectory is proven using careful energy estimates and a spectral condition which characterizes the strength of the feedback. The analysis is general enough to allow for pointwise and distributed measurements and actuation. The main results are derived via arguments that carry over to appropriate discretisation schemes which allows us to establish corresponding exponential stabilisation results also on the discrete level. The validity of our results and the importance of some of our assumptions are illustrated by numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Two-Degree-of-Freedom PID Controller Design for Unknown LTI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the set-point tracking problem in MIMO LTI systems with unknown model parameters. The proposed method integrates (i) the feedforward design and (ii) the PID gain tuning. We also establish a unified theoretical analysis for both components. For the feedforward design, we develop an algorithm that constructs the feedforward controller directly from the input/output data, and provide a theoretical analysis on the time horizon of the data. For the PID gain tuning, we formulate an optimization problem and solve it by employing a model-free policy gradient method combined with a variance reduction method. We further provide theoretical analyses on the required time horizon and the sample complexity of the input/output data. These analyses incorporate the result of the feedforward design into that of the PID gain tuning. In the numerical experiments, the proposed method successfully designs a 2DOF PID controller in the model-free setting.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Gaussian Processes for Model Predictive Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel linear model predictive control algorithm based on a physics-informed Gaussian Process has been introduced, whose realizations strictly follow a system of underlying linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. The control task is formulated as an inference problem by conditioning the Gaussian process prior on the setpoints and incorporating pointwise soft-constraints as further virtual setpoints. We apply this method to systems of nonlinear differential equations, obtaining a local approximation through the linearization around an equilibrium point. In the case of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point convergence is given through the Bayesian inference schema of the Gaussian Process. Results for this are demonstrated in a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Systematic Review of Smart Factories Production in Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technology plays an undeniable role in today's industrial world, especially in manufacturing and smart factories. Unlike previous industrial revolutions, humans are at the core of the fifth generation of the Industrial Revolution. One of the critical aspects of Industry 5.0 (I 5.0) is its emphasis on human-centricity. The integration of modern technologies can be clearly observed in smart factories, which offer enhanced comfort and professionalism. This study highlights the significance of I 5.0 and smart factory production (SFP). A total of 36 articles are reviewed and systematically categorized using the meta-synthesis methodology. The research emphasizes the influence of I 5.0 on SFP through the use of modern technologies and comprehensive policy frameworks. This new paradigm has the potential to streamline people's lives and bring a transformative shift to smart factory production lines. Enhancing the structure of factories appears feasible under this optimistic perspective.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Randomized Gradient-Free optimization with Compressed Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two fundamental challenges in distributed online convex optimization: communication efficiency and optimization under limited feedback. We propose Online Compressed Gradient Tracking with one-point Bandit Feedback (OCGT-BF), a novel algorithm that harness data compression and gradient-free optimization techniques in distributed networks. Our algorithm incorporates a compression scheme with error compensation mechanisms to reduce communication overhead while maintaining convergence guarantees. Unlike traditional approaches that assume perfect communication and full gradient access, OCGT-BF operates effectively under practical constraints by combining gradient-like tracking with one-point feedback estimation. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the dynamic regret bounds under both bandit feedback and stochastic gradient scenarios. Finally, extensive experiments validate that OCGT-BF achieves low dynamic regret while significantly reducing communication requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews discounting approaches for modeling multi-year energy investments, focusing on total versus annualised cost formulations. We discuss how time value of money is handled, and how salvage value and milestone-year weighting can address mismatches between asset lifetimes and model horizons. These methods are implemented in the open-source TulipaEnergyModel to support transparent and tractable long-term energy system planning.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Discrete-Time Mixed Policies and Continuous-Time Relaxed Controls in Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is currently one of the most popular methods, with breakthrough results in a variety of fields. The framework relies on the concept of Markov decision process (MDP), which corresponds to a discrete time optimal control problem. In the RL literature, such problems are usually formulated with mixed policies, from which a random action is sampled at each time step. Recently, the optimal control community has studied continuous-time versions of RL algorithms, replacing MDPs with mixed policies by continuous time stochastic processes with relaxed controls. In this work, we rigorously connect the two problems: we prove the strong convergence of the former towards the latter when the time discretization goes to $0$.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the ``Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Stochastic Studies on Additional Food Provided Prey-Predator Systems with Group Defence among Prey and Mutual Interference among Predators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of competition and additional food on prey-predator dynamics has attracted considerable interest from mathematical biology researchers in recent times. In this study, we consider an additional food provided prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-IV functional response among mutually interferring predators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the proposed model. We study the existence and stability of equilibrium points and further explored bifurcations with respect to the additional food and competition. We further study the global dynamics of the system and discuss the consequences of providing additional food. Later, we do the time-optimal control studies with respect to the quality and quantity of additional food as control variables by transforming the independent variable in the control system. Making use of the Pontraygin maximum principle, we characterize the optimal quality of additional food and optimal quantity of additional food. We further enhanced the model by incorpoating both continuous and discrete noise. We further characterized and numerically simulated the stochastic optimal controls through Sufficient Stochastic Maximum Principle. We show that the findings of these dynamics and control studies have the potential to be applied to a variety of problems in pest management.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the ground state energy of the three-dimensional magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the shape optimization problem of minimizing the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field among three-dimensional domains of fixed volume. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, a generalized ''magnetic'' Faber-Krahn inequality does not hold and the minimizers are not expected to be balls when the magnetic field is turned on. An analysis of the problem among cylindrical domains reveals geometric constraints for general minimizers. In particular, minimizers must elongate with a certain rate along the direction of the magnetic field as the field strength increases. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we present numerical minimizers which confirm this prediction and give rise to further conjectures.</description>

      <title>On spatial systems of cities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are there multiple equilibria in the spatial economy? This paper develops a unified framework that integrates systems of cities and regional models to address this question within a general geographic space. A key feature is the endogenous formation of commuting areas linking a continuum of residential locations to a finite set of potential business districts. Using tools from computational geometry and shape optimization, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of spatial equilibria. For plausible parameter values, urban location is indeterminate, but, conditional on an urban system, city sizes are uniquely determined. The framework reconciles seemingly conflicting empirical findings on the role of geography and scale economies in shaping the spatial economy.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Finding Small Subgradients in Nonsmooth Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the oracle complexity of producing $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points of Lipschitz functions, in the sense proposed by Zhang et al. [2020]. While there exist dimension-free randomized algorithms for producing such points within $\widetilde{O}(1/\delta\epsilon^3)$ first-order oracle calls, we show that no dimension-free rate can be achieved by a deterministic algorithm. On the other hand, we point out that this rate can be derandomized for smooth functions with merely a logarithmic dependence on the smoothness parameter. Moreover, we establish several lower bounds for this task which hold for any randomized algorithm, with or without convexity. Finally, we show how the convergence rate of finding $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points can be improved in case the function is convex, a setting which we motivate by proving that in general no finite time algorithm can produce points with small subgradients even for convex functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing convergence rates for infinite dimensional linear programming problems (LPs) within the context of the moment-sum-of-squares hierarchy. Our primary focus is on extending the existing convergence rate analysis, initially developed for static polynomial optimization, to the more general and challenging domain of the generalized moment problem. We establish an easy-to-follow procedure for obtaining convergence rates. Our methodology is based on, firstly, a state-of-the-art degree bound for Putinar's Positivstellensatz, secondly, quantitative polynomial approximation bounds, and, thirdly, a geometric Slater condition on the infinite dimensional LP. We address a broad problem formulation that encompasses various applications, such as optimal control, volume computation, and exit location of stochastic processes. We illustrate the procedure at these three problems and, using a recent improvement on effective versions of Putinar's Positivstellensatz, we improve existing convergence rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the tilt stability for the minimization of the sum of a twice continuously differentiable matrix-valued function and the Ky-Fan $\kappa$-norm. To achieve this goal, we first provide a sufficient and necessary condition for a local minimizer of the composite $f=\varphi+g$ to be tilt-stable with the second subderivative of $g$, where $g$ is a closed proper convex function, and $\varphi$ is a twice continuously differentiable function that is locally convex at the local minimizer. Then, we apply the sufficient and necessary condition to the concerned Ky-Fan $\kappa$-norm composite problem, and employ the expression of second subderivative of the Ky-Fan $\kappa$-norm to derive a verifiable criterion to identify the tilt stability of a local minimum for this class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems. As a byproduct, a practical criterion is obtained for identifying the tilt stablity of solutions to the nuclear-norm and spectral norm regularized minimization problems.</description>

      <title>Partial classification of spectrum maximizing products for pairs of $2\times2$ matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments suggest that typical finite sets of square matrices admit spectrum maximizing products (SMPs): that is, products that attain the joint spectral radius (JSR). Furthermore, those SMPs are often combinatorially "simple." In this paper, we consider pairs of real $2 \times 2$ matrices. We identify regions in the space of such pairs where SMPs are guaranteed to exist and to have a simple structure. We also identify another region where SMPs may fail to exist (in fact, this region includes all known counterexamples to the finiteness conjecture), but nevertheless a Sturmian maximizing measure exists. Though our results apply to a large chunk of the space of pairs of $2 \times 2$ matrices, including for instance all pairs of non-negative matrices, they leave out certain "wild" regions where more complicated behavior is possible.</description>

      <title>Contextual Stochastic Optimization for Omnichannel Multi-Courier Order Fulfillment Under Delivery Time Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies a large-scale order fulfillment problem for a leading e-commerce company in the United States. The challenge involves selecting fulfillment centers and shipping carriers with observational data only to efficiently process orders from a vast network of physical stores and warehouses. The company's current practice relies on heuristic rules that choose the cheapest fulfillment and shipping options for each unit, without considering opportunities for batching items or the reliability of carriers in meeting expected delivery dates. The paper develops a data-driven Contextual Stochastic Optimization (CSO) framework that integrates distributional forecasts of delivery time deviations with stochastic and robust order fulfillment optimization models. The framework optimizes the selection of fulfillment centers and carriers, accounting for item consolidation and delivery time uncertainty. Validated on a real-world data set containing tens of thousands of products, each with hundreds to thousands of fulfillment options, the proposed CSO framework significantly enhances the accuracy of meeting customer-expected delivery dates compared to current practices. It provides a flexible balance between reducing fulfillment costs and managing delivery time deviation risks, emphasizing the importance of contextual information and distributional forecasts in order fulfillment. This is the first paper that studies the omnichannel multi-courier order fulfillment problem with delivery time uncertainty through the lens of contextual optimization, fusing machine learning and optimization.</description>

      <title>Examining Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport and Sinkhorn Divergences for Spatial Forecast Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optimal transport (OT) problem seeks to find the cheapest mapping between two distributions with equal total density, given the cost of transporting density from one place to another. Unbalanced OT allows for different total density in each distribution. This is the typical setting for precipitation forecast and observation data, when considering the densities as accumulated rainfall, or intensity. In this work, entropic unbalanced OT and its associated Sinkhorn divergence are examined as a spatial forecast verification method for precipitation data. It offers many attractive features, such as morphing one field into another, defining a distance between fields and providing feature based optimal assignment. It is found that the Sinkhorn divergence is robust against the common double penalty problem (a form of phase error), on average aligns with expert assessments of model performance, and allows for a variety of novel pictorial illustrations of error. It provides informative summary scores, and has few limitations to its application. Combined, these findings place unbalanced entropy regularised optimal transport and the Sinkhorn divergence as an informative method which follows geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories is presented. In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a Chain of Three Hyperbolic PDEs using a Time-Delay Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stabilization of a chain system consisting of three hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The system is reformulated into a pure transport system of equations via an invertible backstepping transformation. Using the method of characteristics and exploiting the inherent cascade structure of the chain, the stabilization problem is reduced to that of an associated Integral Difference Equation (IDE). A dynamic controller is designed for the IDE, whose gains are computed by solving a system of Fredholm-type integral equations. This approach provides a systematic framework for achieving exponential stabilization of the chain of hyperbolic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time mean field games: a primal-dual characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a primal-dual formulation for continuous-time mean field games (MFGs) and provides a complete analytical characterization of the set of all Nash equilibria (NEs). We first show that for any given mean field flow, the representative player's control problem with {\it measurable coefficients} is equivalent to a linear program over the space of occupation measures. We then establish the dual formulation of this linear program as a maximization problem over smooth subsolutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which plays a fundamental role in characterizing NEs of MFGs. Finally, a complete characterization of \emph{all NEs for MFGs} is established by the strong duality between the linear program and its dual problem. This strong duality is obtained by studying the solvability of the dual problem, and in particular through analyzing the regularity of the associated HJB equation.
  Compared with existing approaches for MFGs, the primal-dual formulation and its NE characterization do not require the convexity of the associated Hamiltonian or the uniqueness of its optimizer, and remain applicable when the HJB equation lacks classical or even continuous solutions.</description>

      <title>Model Consistency of the Iterative Regularization of Dual Ascent for Low-Complexity Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularization is a core component of modern inverse problems as it allows to establish well-posedness to the solution of interests. Popular regularization approaches include variational regularization and iterative regularization. The former one can be tackled by solving a variational optimization problem, which is the sum of a regularization term and a data-fidelity term balanced by a proper weight, while the latter one chooses a proper stopping time to avoid overfitting to the noise. In the study of regularization, an important topic is the relation between the solution obtained by regularization and the original ground truth. When the ground truth has low-complexity structure which is encoded as the "model", a sensitivity property shows that the solution obtained from proper regularization that promotes the same structure is robust to small perturbations, this is called "model consistency". For variational regularization, model consistency of linear inverse problem is studied in [1]. While, for iterative regularization, the existence of model consistency is an open problem. In this paper, based on a recent development of partial smoothness which is also considered in [1], we show that if the noise level is sufficiently small and a proper stopping time is chosen, the solution by iterative regularization also achieves model consistency and more exhibit local linear convergence behavior. Numerical simulations are provided to verify our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Centrality of shortest paths: Algorithms and complexity results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree centrality of a node, defined as the number of nodes adjacent to it, is often used as a measure of importance of a node to the structure of a network. This metric can be extended to paths in a network, where the degree centrality of a path is defined as the number of nodes adjacent to it. In this paper, we reconsider the problem of finding the most degree-central shortest path in an unweighted network. We propose a polynomial algorithm with the worst-case running time of $O(|E||V|^2\Delta(G))$, where $|V|$ is the number of vertices in the network, $|E|$ is the number of edges in the network, and $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of the graph. We conduct a numerical study of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world networks and compare our results to the existing literature. In addition, we show that the same problem is NP-hard when a weighted graph is considered. Furthermore, we consider other centrality measures, such as the betweenness and closeness centrality, showing that the problem of finding the most betweenness-central shortest path is solvable in polynomial time and finding the most closeness-central shortest path is NP-hard, regardless of whether the graph is weighted or not.</description>

      <title>Observability of complex systems via conserved quantities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many systems in biology, physics, and engineering are modeled by nonlinear dynamical systems where the states are usually unknown and only a subset of the state variables can be physically measured. Can we understand the full system from what we measure? In the mathematics literature, this question is framed as the observability problem. It has to do with recovering information about the state variables from the observed states (the measurements). In this paper, we relate the observability problem to another structural feature of many models relevant in the physical and biological sciences: the conserved quantity. For models based on systems of differential equations, conserved quantities offer desirable properties such as dimension reduction which simplifies model analysis. Here, we use differential embeddings to show that conserved quantities involving a set of special variables provide more flexibility in what can be measured to address the observability problem for systems of interest in biology. Specifically, we provide conditions under which a collection of conserved quantities make the system observable. We apply our methods to provide alternate measurable variables in models where conserved quantities have been used for model analysis historically in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Extended convexity and smoothness and their applications in deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical assumptions like strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness often fail to capture the nature of deep learning optimization problems, which are typically non-convex and non-smooth, making traditional analyses less applicable. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning by extending the conventional notions of strong convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. By leveraging these concepts, we prove that, under the established constraints, the empirical risk minimization problem is equivalent to optimizing the local gradient norm and structural error, which together constitute the upper and lower bounds of the empirical risk. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm can effectively minimize the local gradient norm. Additionally, techniques like skip connections, over-parameterization, and random parameter initialization are shown to help control the structural error. Ultimately, we validate the core conclusions of this paper through extensive experiments. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of non-convex optimization in deep learning.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Dual ADMM for Huber Regression with Fused Lasso Penalty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ordinary least squares estimate in linear regression is sensitive to the influence of errors with large variance, which reduces its robustness, especially when dealing with heavy-tailed errors or outliers frequently encountered in real-world scenarios. To address this issue and accommodate the sparsity of coefficients along with their sequential disparities, we combine the adaptive robust Huber loss function with a fused lasso penalty. This combination yields a robust estimator capable of simultaneously achieving estimation and variable selection. Furthermore, we utilize an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers to solve this regression model from a dual perspective. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments carried out on both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Adversarially-Robust Gossip Algorithms for Approximate Quantile and Mean Computations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents gossip algorithms for aggregation tasks that demonstrate both robustness to adversarial corruptions of any order of magnitude and optimality across a substantial range of these corruption levels. Gossip algorithms distribute information in a scalable and efficient way by having random pairs of nodes exchange small messages. Value aggregation problems are of particular interest in this setting as they occur frequently in practice and many elegant algorithms have been proposed for computing aggregates and statistics such as averages and quantiles. An important and well-studied advantage of gossip algorithms is their robustness to message delays, network churn, and unreliable message transmissions. These crucial robustness guarantees however only hold if all nodes follow the protocol and no messages are corrupted. In this paper, we remedy this by providing a framework to model both adversarial participants and message corruptions in gossip-style communications by allowing an adversary to control a small fraction of the nodes or corrupt messages arbitrarily. Despite this very powerful and general corruption model, we show that one can design robust gossip algorithms for many important aggregation problems. Our algorithms guarantee that almost all nodes converge to an approximately correct answer with optimal efficiency and essentially as fast as without corruptions. The design of adversarially-robust gossip algorithms poses completely new challenges. Despite this, our algorithms remain very simple variations of known non-robust algorithms with often only subtle changes to avoid non-compliant nodes gaining too much influence over outcomes. While our algorithms remain simple, their analysis is much more complex and often requires a completely different approach than the non-adversarial setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design offset-free nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for surrogate models based on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). The model used for prediction in MPC is augmented with a disturbance term, that is estimated by an observer. If the full information about the equilibrium of the real system is not available, a reference calculator is introduced in the algorithm to compute the MPC state and input references. The control algorithm guarantees offset-free tracking of the controlled output under the assumption that the modeling errors are asymptotically constant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is showcased with numerical simulations for two popular benchmark systems: the van-der-Pol oscillator and the four-tanks process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantitative trading risk management purposes, we present a novel idea: the realized local volatility surface. Concisely, it stands for the conditional expected volatility when sudden market behaviors of the underlying occur. One is able to explore risk management usages by following the orthotical Delta-Gamma dynamic hedging framework. The realized local volatility surface is, mathematically, a generalized Wiener measure from historical prices. It is reconstructed via employing high-frequency trading market data. A Stick-Breaking Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, producing a local volatility surface with 95% credible intervals. A practically validated Bayesian nonparametric estimation workflow. Empirical results on TSLA high-frequency data illustrate its ability to capture counterfactual volatility. We also discuss its application in improving volatility-based risk management.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{i+2}{2}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has a frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has a frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 1.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>
