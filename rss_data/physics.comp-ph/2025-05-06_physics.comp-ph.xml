      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are A-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.</description>

      <title>Polar Interpolants for Thin-Shell Microstructure Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new formulation for material homogenization of thin-shell microstructures. It addresses important challenges that limit the quality of previous approaches: methods that fit the energy response neglect visual impact, methods that fit the stress response are not conservative, and all of them are limited to a low-dimensional interplay between deformation modes. The new formulation is rooted on the following design principles: the material energy functions are conservative by definition, they are formulated on the high-dimensional membrane and bending domain to capture the complex interplay of the different deformation modes, the material function domain is maximally aligned with the training data, and the material parameters and the optimization are formulated on stress instead of energy for better correlation with visual impact. The key novelty of our formulation is a new type of high-order RBF interpolant for polar coordinates, which allows us to fulfill all the design principles. We design a material function using this novel interpolant, as well as an overall homogenization workflow. Our results demonstrate very accurate fitting of diverse microstructure behaviors, both quantitatively and qualitatively superior to previous work.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Integration of Stiff Reactive Systems Using Gradient-Informed Autoencoder and Neural Ordinary Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combined autoencoder (AE) and neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) framework has been used as a data-driven reduced-order model for time integration of a stiff reacting system. In this study, a new loss term using a latent variable gradient is proposed, and its impact on model performance is analyzed in terms of robustness, accuracy, and computational efficiency. A data set was generated by a chemical reacting solver, Cantera, for the ignition of homogeneous hydrogen-air and ammonia/hydrogen-air mixtures in homogeneous constant pressure reactors over a range of initial temperatures and equivalence ratios. The AE-NODE network was trained with the data set using two different loss functions based on the latent variable mapping and the latent gradient. The results show that the model trained using the latent gradient loss significantly improves the predictions at conditions outside the range of the trained data. The study demonstrates the importance of incorporating time derivatives in the loss function. Upon proper design of the latent space and training method, the AE+NODE architecture is found to predict the reaction dynamics at high fidelity at substantially reduced computational cost by the reduction of the dimensionality and temporal stiffness.</description>

      <title>Hyper Boris integrators for kinetic plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a family of numerical solvers for the nonrelativistic Newton--Lorentz equation in kinetic plasma simulations. The new solvers extend the standard 4-step Boris procedure, which has second-order accuracy in time, in three ways. First, we repeat the 4-step procedure multiple times, using an $n$-times smaller timestep ($\Delta t/n$). We derive a formula for the arbitrary subcycling number $n$, so that we obtain the result without repeating the same calculations. Second, prior to the 4-step procedure, we apply Boris-type gyrophase corrections to the electromagnetic field. In addition to a well-known correction to the magnetic field, we correct the electric field in an anisotropic manner to achieve higher-order ($N=2,4,6 \dots$th order) accuracy. Third, combining these two methods, we propose a family of high-accuracy particle solvers, the hyper Boris solvers, which have two hyperparameters of the subcycling number $n$ and the order of accuracy, $N$. The $n$-cycle $N$th-order solver gives a numerical error of $\sim (\Delta t/n)^{N}$ at affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Velocity-Inferred Hamiltonian Neural Networks: Learning Energy-Conserving Dynamics from Position-Only Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of physical systems often relies on learning both positions and momenta to accurately capture Hamiltonian dynamics. However, in many practical scenarios, only position measurements are readily available. In this work, we introduce a method to train a standard Hamiltonian Neural Network (HNN) using only position data, enabled by a theoretical result that permits transforming the Hamiltonian $H(q,p)$ into a form $H(q, v)$. Under certain assumptions, namely, an invertible relationship between momentum and velocity, we formally prove the validity of this substitution and demonstrate how it allows us to infer momentum from position alone. We apply our approach to canonical examples including the spring-mass system, pendulum, two-body, and three-body problems. Our results show that using only position data is sufficient for stable and energy-consistent long-term predictions, suggesting a promising pathway for data-driven discovery of Hamiltonian systems when momentum measurements are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Node pruning reveals compact and optimal substructures within large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural complexity of reservoir networks poses a significant challenge, often leading to excessive computational costs and suboptimal performance. In this study, we introduce a systematic, task specific node pruning framework that enhances both the efficiency and adaptability of reservoir networks. By identifying and eliminating redundant nodes, we demonstrate that large networks can be compressed while preserving or even improving performance on key computational tasks. Our findings reveal the emergence of optimal subnetwork structures from larger Erdos Renyi random networks, indicating that efficiency is governed not merely by size but by topological organization. A detailed analysis of network structure at both global and node levels uncovers the role of density distributions, special-radius and asymmetric input-output node distributions, among other graph-theoretic measures that enhance the computational capacity of pruned compact networks. We show that pruning leads to non-uniform network refinements, where specific nodes and connectivity patterns become critical for information flow and memory retention. This work offers fundamental insights into how structural optimization influences reservoir dynamics, providing a pathway toward designing more efficient, scalable, and interpretable machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Simulations from a Reinforcement-Learned Exponential Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving for the many-body wavefunction represents a significant challenge on both classical and quantum devices because of the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space with system size. While the complexity of the wavefunction can be reduced through conventional ans\"{a}tze (e.g., the coupled cluster ansatz), it can still grow rapidly with system size even on quantum devices. An exact, universal two-body exponential ansatz for the many-body wavefunction has been shown to be generated from the solution of the contracted Schr\"odinger equation (CSE), and recently, this ansatz has been implemented without classical approximation on quantum simulators and devices for the scalable simulation of many-body quantum systems. Here we combine the solution of the CSE with a form of artificial intelligence known as reinforcement learning (RL) to generate highly compact circuits that implement this ansatz without sacrificing accuracy. As a natural extension of CSE, we reformulate the wavefunction update as a Markovian decision process and train the agent to select the optimal actions at each iteration based upon only the current CSE residual. Compact circuits with high accuracy are achieved for H3 and H4 molecules over a range of molecular geometries.</description>

      <title>Inverse Modeling of Dielectric Response in Time Domain using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric response (DR) of insulating materials is key input information for designing electrical insulation systems and defining safe operating conditions of various HV devices. In dielectric materials, different polarization and conduction processes occur at different time scales, making it challenging to physically interpret raw measured data. To analyze DR measurement results, equivalent circuit models (ECMs) are commonly used, reducing the complexity of the physical system to a number of circuit elements that capture the dominant response. This paper examines the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inverse modeling of DR in time domain using parallel RC circuits. To assess their performance, we test PINNs on synthetic data generated from analytical solutions of corresponding ECMs, incorporating Gaussian noise to simulate measurement errors. Our results show that PINNs are highly effective at solving well-conditioned inverse problems, accurately estimating up to five unknown RC parameters with minimal requirements on neural network size, training duration, and hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, we extend the ECMs to incorporate temperature dependence and demonstrate that PINNs can accurately recover embedded, nonlinear temperature functions from noisy DR data sampled at different temperatures. This case study in modeling DR in time domain presents a solution with wide-ranging potential applications in disciplines relying on ECMs, utilizing the latest technology in machine learning for scientific computation.</description>

      <title>Liapunov exponent distributions and maps for multiple parameter logistic equation. Application to DNA and RNA sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiple parameter logistic equation has previously been utilized to determine the global stability of ternary codes, based on the arrangement of different symbols within the code. This approach has been extended to DNA and RNA sequences, proposing a specific application in the context of reading and translation processes involved in DNA replication and RNA-mediated protein codification. To address the complexity of mapping Liapunov exponents in terms of four parameters representing the different nucleotide bases specialized mapping techniques have been developed. These include Liapunov exponent distributions for entire sequences, as well as binary maps that classify nucleotide bases based on their chemical type (purinic or pyrimidinic). Such methodologies provide a framework for examining the structural and functional properties of genetic material. The sequences analyzed encompass a wide range of DNA and RNA types, including those with and without introns, as well as codifying and noncodifying regions. This multifaceted approach offers valuable insights into the dynamic behavior and stability of nucleotide arrangements, contributing to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes that govern genetic replication and protein synthesis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Krylov methods for linear response in plane-wave electronic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm based on inexact GMRES methods for linear response calculations in density functional theory. Such calculations require iteratively solving a nested linear problem $\mathcal{E} \delta\rho = b$ to obtain the variation of the electron density $\delta \rho$. Notably each application of the dielectric operator $\mathcal{E}$ in turn requires the iterative solution of multiple linear systems, the Sternheimer equations. We develop computable bounds to estimate the accuracy of the density variation given the tolerances to which the Sternheimer equations have been solved. Based on this result we suggest reliable strategies for adaptively selecting the convergence tolerances of the Sternheimer equations, such that each applications of $\mathcal{E}$ is no more accurate than needed. Experiments on challenging materials systems of practical relevance demonstrate our strategies to achieve superlinear convergence as well as a reduction of computational time by about 40% while preserving the accuracy of the returned response solution. Our algorithm seamlessly combines with standard preconditioning approaches known from the context of self-consistent field problems making it a promising framework for efficient response solvers based on Krylov subspace techniques.</description>

      <title>Anomalous valley Hall effect in monolayer chromium-based triple-Q magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the density functional theory calculations, we predict that several monolayer chromium-based materials exhibit a triple-Q tetrahedral magnetic insulating ground state. By studying the effect of biaxial strain on monolayer CrSi$\rm{_2}$P$\rm{_4}$ under various on-site Coulomb interactions, we reveal that this magnetic insulating state, sandwiched between the itinerant $120^{\circ}$ coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, originates from the competition between antiferromagnetic exchange and double exchange interactions of Cr 3$d$ electrons which can also be applied to account for the ground states in other chromium-based materials. Remarkably, anomalous valley Hall effect with giant valley splitting is discovered in the magnetic states of these inversion-asymmetric systems without requiring spin-orbit coupling or net magnetization. Our findings open a new avenue towards exploring monolayer materials for valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Temperature and pressure reconstruction in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection by Lagrangian velocities using PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Velocity, pressure, and temperature are the key variables for understanding thermal convection, and measuring them all is a complex task. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to reconstruct temperature and pressure fields based on given Lagrangian velocity data. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) based on a multilayer perceptron architecture and a periodic sine activation function is used to reconstruct both the temperature and the pressure for two cases of turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (Pr = 6.9, Ra = $10^9$). The first dataset is generated with DNS and it includes Lagrangian velocity data of 150000 tracer particles. The second contains a PTV experiment with the same system parameters in a water-filled cubic cell, and we observed about 50000 active particle tracks per time step with the open-source framework proPTV. A realistic temperature and pressure field could be reconstructed in both cases, which underlines the importance of PINNs also in the context of experimental data. In the case of the DNS, the reconstructed temperature and pressure fields show a 90\% correlation over all particles when directly validated against the ground truth. Thus, the proposed method, in combination with particle tracking velocimetry, is able to provide velocity, temperature, and pressure fields in convective flows even in the hard turbulence regime. The PINN used in this paper is compatible with proPTV and is part of an open source project. It is available on request at https://github.com/DLR_AS_BOA/RBC_PINN.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamic and structural airfoil shape optimisation via Transfer Learning-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to introduce a transfer learning-enhanced, multi-objective, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology that is able to optimise the geometry of any airfoil based on concomitant aerodynamic and structural criteria. To showcase the method, we aim to maximise the lift-to-drag ratio $C_L/C_D$ while preserving the structural integrity of the airfoil -- as modelled by its maximum thickness -- and train the DRL agent using a list of different transfer learning (TL) strategies. The performance of the DRL agent is compared with Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a traditional gradient-free optimisation method. Results indicate that DRL agents are able to perform multi-objective shape optimisation, that the DRL approach outperforms PSO in terms of computational efficiency and shape optimisation performance, and that the TL-enhanced DRL agent achieves performance comparable to the DRL one, while further saving substantial computational resources.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Moreover, we demonstrate improved robustness during MD simulations of the MLIP models trained with the proposed weakly supervised loss. Finally, our approach improves the fine-tuning of foundation models on sparse, highly accurate ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci.</description>

      <title>Learning stochastic dynamics from snapshots through regularized unbalanced optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The introduced methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. SPiFOL, as a physics-informed operator learning method, enables rapid predictions through forward inference after training. To ensure accuracy, we incorporate physical constraints and diversify the training data. However, performance may still degrade for out-of-distribution microstructures. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. The framework shows great potential for efficient and scalable prediction of mechanical responses in complex material systems while also reducing the training time required for training physics-informed neural operators.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Theory of Scalar Volterra Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between pure and applied research on scalar, linear Volterra equations by examining five major classes: integral and integro-differential equations with completely monotone kernels (viscoelastic models); equations with positive definite kernels (partially observed quantum systems); difference equations with discrete, positive definite kernels; a generalized class of delay differential equations; and a generalized class of fractional differential equations. We develop a general, spectral theory that provides a system of correspondences between these disparate domains. As a result, we see how `interconversion' (operator inversion) arises as a natural, continuous involution within each class, yielding a plethora of novel formulas for analytical solutions of such equations. This spectral theory unifies and extends existing results in viscoelasticity, signal processing, and analysis. It also introduces a geometric construction of the regularized Hilbert transform, revealing a fundamental connection to fractional and delay differential equations. Finally, it offers a practical toolbox for Volterra equations of all classes, reducing many to pen-and-paper calculations and introducing a powerful spectral approach for general Volterra equations based on rational approximation.</description>
