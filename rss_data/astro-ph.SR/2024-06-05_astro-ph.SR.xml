      <title>Orbits and Dynamical Masses for Six Binary Systems in the Hyades Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report long baseline interferometric observations with the CHARA Array that resolve six previously known double-lined spectroscopic binary systems in the Hyades cluster, with orbital periods ranging from 3 to 358 days: HD 27483, HD 283882, HD 26874, HD 27149, HD 30676, and HD 28545. We combine those observations with new and existing radial-velocity measurements, to infer the dynamical masses for the components as well as the orbital parallaxes. For most stars the masses are determined to better than 1%. Our work significantly increases the number of systems with mass determinations in the cluster. We find that while current models of stellar evolution for the age and metallicity of the Hyades are able to reproduce the overall shape of the empirical mass-luminosity relation, they overestimate the $V$-band fluxes by about 0.1 mag between 0.5 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The disagreement is smaller in $H$, and near zero in $K$, and depends somewhat on the model. We also make use of the TESS light curves to estimate rotation periods for our targets, and detect numerous flares in one of them (HD 283882), estimating an average flaring rate of 0.44 events per day.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field evolution for crystallization-driven dynamos in C/O white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of magnetic fields generated by the crystallization-driven dynamo in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) with masses $\lesssim1.05\ M_{\odot}$. We use scalings for the dynamo to demonstrate that the initial magnetic field strength ($B_{0}$) has an upper limit that depends on the initial convection zone size ($R_{\mathrm{out},0}$) and the WD mass. We solve the induction equation to follow the magnetic field evolution after the dynamo phase ends. We show that the predicted surface magnetic field strength ($B_{\mathrm{surf}}$) differs from $B_{0}$ by at least a factor of $\sim$0.3. This reduction depends on $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, where values smaller than half of the star radius give $B_{\mathrm{surf}}\lesssim0.01\ B_{0}$. We implement electrical conductivities that account for the solid phase effect on the Ohmic diffusion. We observe that the conductivity increases as the solid core grows, freezing in the magnetic field at a certain point of the evolution and slowing its outwards transport. We study the effect of turbulent magnetic diffusivity induced by the convection and find that for a small $R_{\mathrm{out},0}$, $B_{\mathrm{surf}}$ is stronger than the non-turbulent diffusion cases because of the more rapid transport, but still orders of magnitude smaller than $B_{0}$. Given these limitations, the crystallization-driven dynamo theory could explain only magnetic C/O WDs with field strengths less than a few MG for the mass range 0.45-1.05 $M_{\odot}$. Our results also suggest that a buried fossil field must be at least 100 times stronger than observed surface fields if crystallization-driven convection is responsible for its transport to the surface.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the optical emission lines and the X-ray emission during the super-active stage of T CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T CrB is a symbiotic star that experiences nova outbursts every $\sim$ 80~yr. The next, long-anticipated nova outburst should occur during the 2024-2026 period. Here, we present results of high-resolution optical spectroscopy of T CrB in the period 2016 - 2023. In these spectra, we measured the equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, HeI and HeII emission lines. The maximum equivalent width (EW) was recorded on May 2021, when the EW of $H\alpha$ reached -44.6 \AA and H$\beta$ = -21.5 \AA. At the other extreme, the minimum of EW($H\alpha$)= -2.9 \AA was recorded in October 2023. After October 2023, the B-band emission brightened, suggesting a re-appearance of the orbital modulation. In addition to the optical data, we study the X-ray behaviour in the same period. We find a strong correlation between $EW(H\alpha)$ and X-ray flux with a correlation coefficient -0.78 and a significance of 2.6$\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous spectropolarimetric observations in the H$\alpha$ and Ca II 8662 {\AA} lines of an active region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectropolarimetric observations of an active region recorded simultaneously in the H$\alpha$ Ca II 8662 {\AA} lines. The sunspot exhibits multiple structures, including a lightbridge and a region where Ca II 8662 {\AA} line core is in emission. Correspondingly, the H$\alpha$ line core image displays brightening in the emission region, with the spectral profiles showing elevated line cores. The stratification of the line-of-sight magnetic field is inferred through non-LTE multiline inversions of the Ca II 8662 {\AA} line and the weak field approximation over the H$\alpha$ line. The field strength inferred from the H$\alpha$ line core is consistently smaller than that inferred from inversions at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5. However, the study finds no correlation between the WFA over the core of the H$\alpha$ line and that inferred from inversions at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5. In regions exhibiting emission features, the morphology of the magnetic field at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5 resembles that at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$1, with slightly higher or comparable field strengths. The magnetic field morphology inferred from the core of the H$\alpha$ line is also similar to that inferred from the full spectral range of the H$\alpha$ line in the emission region. The field strength inferred in the lightbridge at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$1 is smaller than the surrounding umbral regions and comparable at $\log \tau_{500}$ = $-$4.5. Similarly, the field strength inferred in the lightbridge from the WFA over the H$\alpha$ line appears lower compared to the surrounding umbral regions.</description>

      <title>Spectral line fluorescence in moving envelopes of stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of optical fluorescent lines in moving media has not yet been studied in detail, so this work represents a first step in investigating the fluorescence process in different types of macroscopic velocity fields: (a) accelerated outflows, (b) accelerated infalls, and (c) non-monotonic velocity fields (such as an accelerating outflow followed by a deceleration region or an accretion shock front). We solve the radiative transfer equations for the lines involved in the fluorescent process, assuming spherical symmetry and a simplified atomic model. We use the framework of the generalized Sobolev theory for computing the interacting, non-local source functions. The emergent line fluxes are then integrated exactly. Because of Doppler shifts in the moving gaseous envelope, photons of the three lines involved in TTS FeI fluorescence CaII H, FeI 3969, and H_epsilon interact with each other in a complex way, so that fluorescent amplification of the line flux occurs not only for FeI 3969, but also for the other two lines, in all velocity fields that we investigated. With the assumption of LTE populations, the line source functions of moderately optically thick lines are not strongly affected by line interactions, while they are depressed in the inner envelope for optically thick lines because of stellar photon absorption in the interaction regions. Fluorescent amplification takes place mainly in the observer's reference frame during the flux integration. Further comparison with observations will require solving the rate equations for the atomic populations involved, along with the radiation field computed with the method presented here. The main product of this research is the open-source computer code SLIM2 (Spectral Line Interactions in Moving Media), written in Python/Numpy, which numerically solves the fluorescence problem for arbitrary 2D velocities.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of cool stellar atmospheres with \texttt{MANCHA}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Our aim is to test how different binning strategies previously studied in one-dimensional models perform in three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations of stellar atmospheres. Methods. Realistic box-in-a-star simulations of the near-surface convection and photosphere of three spectral types (G2V, K0V, and M2V) were run with the MANCHA code with grey opacity. After reaching the stationary state, one snapshot of each of the three stellar simulations was used to compute the radiative energy exchange rate with grey opacity, opacity binned in four $\tau$-bins, and opacity binned in 18 $\{ \tau, \lambda \}$-bins. These rates were compared with the ones computed with opacity distribution functions. Then, stellar simulations were run with grey, four-bin, and 18-bin opacities to see the impact of the opacity setup on the mean stratification of the temperature and its gradient after time evolution. Results. The simulations of main sequence cool stars with the MANCHA code are consistent with those in the literature. For the three stars, the radiative energy exchange rates computed with 18 bins are remarkably close to the ones computed with the opacity distribution functions. The rates computed with four bins are similar to the rates computed with 18 bins, and present a significant improvement with respect to the rates computed with the Rosseland opacity, especially above the stellar surface. The Rosseland mean can reproduce the proper rates in sub-surface layers, but produces large errors for the atmospheric layers of the G2V and K0V stars. In the case of the M2V star, the Rosseland mean fails even in sub-surface layers, owing to the importance of the contribution from molecular lines in the opacity, underestimated by the harmonic mean. Similar conclusions are reached studying the mean stratification of the temperature and its gradient after time evolution.</description>

      <title>From Chromospheric Evaporation to Coronal Rain: An Investigation of the Mass and Energy Cycle of a Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromospheric evaporation (CE) and coronal rain (CR) represent two crucial phenomena encompassing the circulation of mass and energy during solar flares. While CE marks the start of the hot inflow into the flaring loop, CR marks the end, indicating the outflow in the form of cool and dense condensations. With \textit{IRIS} and \textit{AIA/SDO}, we examine and compare the evolution, dynamics, morphology, and energetics of the CR and CE during a C2.1 flare. The CE is directly observed in imaging and spectra in the \ion{Fe}{XXI} line with \textit{IRIS} and in the \ion{Fe}{XVIII} line of AIA, with upward average total speeds of $138\pm[35]~$km~s$^{-1}$ and a temperature of $[9.03\pm3.28]\times10^{6}$~K. An explosive to gentle CE transition is observed, with an apparent reduction in turbulence. From quiescent to gradual flare phase, the amount and density of CR increases by a factor of $\approx4.4$ and 6, respectively. The rain's velocity increases by a 1.4, in agreement with gas pressure drag. In contrast, the clump widths variation is negligible. The location and morphology of CE match closely those of the rain showers, with similar CE sub-structure to the rain strands, reflecting fundamental scales of mass and energy transport. We obtain a CR outflow mass three times larger than the CE inflow mass, suggesting the presence of unresolved CE, perhaps at higher temperatures. The CR energy corresponds to half that of the CE. These results suggest an essential role of coronal rain in the mass-energy cycle of a flare.</description>

      <title>The impact of asteroseismically calibrated internal mixing on nucleosynthetic wind yields of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroseismology gives us the opportunity to look inside stars and determine their internal properties. Based on these observations, estimations can be made for the amount of the convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing of such stars, and the shape of the mixing profile in the envelope. However, these results are not typically included in stellar evolution models. We aim to investigate the impact of varying convective boundary mixing and envelope mixing in a range based on asteroseismic modelling in stellar models, both for the stellar structure and for the nucleosynthetic yields. In this first study, we focus on the pre-explosive evolution of a 20Msun star and evolve the models to the final phases of carbon burning. We vary the convective boundary mixing, implemented as step-overshoot, with the overshoot parameter in the range 0.05-0.4 and the amount of envelope mixing in the range 1-10$^{6}$ with a mixing profile based on internal gravity waves. We use a large nuclear network of 212 isotopes to study the nucleosynthesis. We find that enhanced mixing according to asteroseismology of main-sequence stars, both at the convective core boundary and in the envelope, has significant effects on the nucleosynthetic wind yields. Our evolutionary models beyond the main sequence diverge in yields from models based on rotational mixing, having longer helium burning lifetimes and lighter helium-depleted cores. We find that the asteroseismic ranges of internal mixing calibrated from core hydrogen burning stars lead to similar wind yields as those resulting from the theory of rotational mixing. Adopting the seismic mixing levels beyond the main sequence, we find earlier transitions to radiative carbon burning compared to models based on rotational mixing. This influences the compactness and the occurrence of shell-mergers, which may affect the supernova properties and explosive nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>The story of SN 2021aatd -- a peculiar 1987A-like supernova with an early-phase luminosity excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing number of peculiar events that cannot be assigned to any of the main supernova (SN) classes. SN 1987A and a handful of similar objects, thought to be explosive outcomes of blue supergiant stars, belong to them: while their spectra closely resemble those of H-rich (IIP) SNe, their light-curve (LC) evolution is very different. Here we present the detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of SN 2021aatd, a peculiar Type II explosion: while its early-time evolution resembles that of the slowly evolving, double-peaked SN 2020faa (however, at a lower luminosity scale), after $\sim$40 days, its LC shape becomes similar to that of SN 1987A-like explosions. Beyond comparing LCs, color curves, and spectra of SN 2021aatd to that of SNe 2020faa, 1987A, and of other objects, we compare the observed spectra with our own SYN++ models and with the outputs of published radiative transfer models. We also modeled the pseudo-bolometric LCs of SNe 2021aatd and 1987A assuming a two-component (core+shell) ejecta, and involving the rotational energy of a newborn magnetar in addition to radioactive decay. We find that both the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2021aatd can be well described with the explosion of a $\sim$15 $M_\odot$ blue supergiant star. Nevertheless, SN 2021aatd shows higher temperatures and weaker Na ID and Ba II 6142 A lines than SN 1987A, which is reminiscent of rather to IIP-like atmospheres. With the applied two-component ejecta model (counting with both decay and magnetar energy), we can successfully describe the bolometric LC of SN 2021aatd, including the first $\sim$40-day long phase showing an excess compared to 87A-like SNe but being strikingly similar to that of the long-lived SN 2020faa. Nevertheless, finding a unified model that also explains the LCs of more luminous events (like SN 2020faa) is still a matter of concern.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: novel channels (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <title>The first Palomar Gattini-IR catalog of J-band light curves: construction and public data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Palomar Gattini-IR is a wide-field, synoptic infrared time domain survey covering $\approx 15000$ sq. deg. of the sky at $\approx 1-3$ night cadence to a depth of $J\approx 13.0$ and $\approx 14.9$ Vega mag in and outside the Galactic plane, respectively. Here, we present the first data release of $J$-band light curves of 2MASS sources within the survey footprint covering approximately the first four years of operations. We describe the construction of the source catalog based on the 2MASS point sources, followed by exposure filtering criteria and forced PSF photometry. The catalog contains light curves of $\approx 286$ million unique sources with 2MASS magnitudes of $J &lt; 15.5$ mag, with a total of $\approx 50$ billion photometric measurements and $\approx 20$ billion individual source detections at signal-to-noise-ratio $&gt; 3$. We demonstrate the photometric fidelity of the catalog by i) quantifying the magnitude-dependent accuracy and uncertainty of the photometry with respect to 2MASS and ii) comparing against forced PGIR aperture photometry for known variable sources. We present simple filtering criteria for selecting reliable photometric measurements as well as example Python notebooks for users. This catalog is the largest compilation of nightly cadence, synoptic infrared light curves to date, comparable to those in the largest optical surveys, providing a stepping stone to upcoming infrared surveys in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Unveiling gas phase H2NCO radical: Laboratory rotational spectroscopy and interstellar search toward IRAS 16293-2422</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The carbamoyl radical (H2NCO) is believed to play a central role in the ice-grain chemistry of crucial interstellar complex organic molecules as formamide and acetamide. Yet, little is known about this radical that remains elusive in laboratory gas-phase experiments. Aims. In order to enable interstellar searches of H2NCO, we have undertaken a mandatory laboratory characterisation of its pure rotational spectrum. Methods. We report the gas-phase laboratory detection of H2NCO, produced by H-atom abstraction from formamide, using pure rotational spectroscopy at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths. Millimetre-wave data were acquired using chirped-pulse Fourier-transform spectroscopy while submillimetre-wave ones were obtained using Zeeman-modulated spectroscopy. Experimental measurements were guided by quantum-chemical calculations at the $\omega$B97X-D/cc-pVQZ level of theory. Interstellar searches for the radical have been undertaken on the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) towards the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. Results. From the assignment and fit of experimental transitions up to 660 GHz, reliable spectroscopic parameters for H2NCO in its ground vibrational state have been derived, enabling accurate spectral predictions. No transitions of the radical were detected on the PILS survey. The inferred upper limit shows that H2NCO abundance is at least 60 times below that of formamide and 160 times below that of HNCO in this source; a value that is in agreement with predictions from a physico-chemical model of this young protostar.</description>

      <title>Optical polarimetry study of Lambda-Orionis star-forming region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optical polarimetric study of a nearby star-forming region, Lambda-Orionis, to map plane-of-the-sky magnetic field geometry to understand the magnetized evolution of the HII region and associated small molecular clouds. We made multi-wavelength polarization observations of 34 bright stars distributed across the region. R-band polarization measurements focused on small molecular clouds BRC 17 and BRC 18 located at the periphery of the HII region are also presented. The magnetic field lines exhibit a large-scale ordered orientation consistent with the Planck sub-mm polarization measurements. The magnetic field lines in both the BRCs are found to be roughly in north-south directions; however, a larger dispersion is noticed in the orientation for BRC 17 compared to BRC 18. Using structure-function analysis, the strength of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic field is estimated as $\sim$28 $\mu$G for BRC 17 and $\sim$40 $\mu$G for BRC 18. The average dust grain size and the mean value of the total-to-selective extinction ratio (R$_{V}$) in the HII region are found to be $\sim$0.51 $\pm$ 0.05 $\mu$m and $\sim$2.9 $\pm$ 0.3, respectively. The distance of the whole HII region is estimated as $\sim$392 $\pm$ 8 pc by combining astrometry information from GAIA EDR3 for YSOs associated with BRCs and confirmed members of central cluster Collinder 69.</description>

      <title>Debris Disks can Contaminate Mid-Infrared Exoplanet Spectra: Evidence for a Circumstellar Debris Disk around Exoplanet Host WASP-39</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signal from a transiting planet can be diluted by astrophysical contamination. In the case of circumstellar debris disks, this contamination could start in the mid-infrared and vary as a function of wavelength, which would then change the observed transmission spectrum for any planet in the system. The MIRI/LRS WASP-39b transmission spectrum shows an unexplained dip starting at $\sim$10 $\mu$m that could be caused by astrophysical contamination. The spectral energy distribution displays excess flux at similar levels to that which are needed to create the dip in the transmission spectrum. In this article, we show that this dip is consistent with the presence of a bright circumstellar debris disk, at a distance of $&gt;$2 au. We discuss how a circumstellar debris disk like that could affect the atmosphere of WASP-39b. We also show that even faint debris disks can be a source of contamination in MIRI exoplanet spectra.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry, Gap Opening and High Accretion Rate on DM Tau: A Hypothesis Based on Interaction of Magnetized Disk Wind with Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over two hundred protoplanetary disk systems have been resolved by ALMA, and the vast majority suggest the presence of planets. The dust gaps in transition disks are considered evidence of giant planets sculpting gas and dust under appropriate disk viscosity. However, the unusually high accretion rates in many T Tauri stars hosting transition disks challenge this theory. As the only disk currently observed with high turbulence, the high accretion rate ($\sim10^{-8.3}M_{\odot}/yr$) observed in DM Tau indicates the presence of strong turbulence may within the system. Considering the recent theoretical advancements in magnetized disk winds is challenging the traditional gap-opening theories and viscosity-driven accretion models, our study presents a pioneering simulation incorporating a simplified magnetized disk wind model to explain the observed features in DM Tau. Employing multi-fluid simulations with an embedded medium mass planet, we successfully replicate the gap formation and asymmetric structures evident in ALMA Band 6 and the recently JVLA 7 mm observations. Our results suggest that when magnetized disk wind dominate the accretion mode of the system, it's entirely possible for a planet with a medium mass to exist within the gap inside 20 au of DM Tau. This means that DM Tau may not be as turbulence as imagined. However, viscosity within the disk should also contribute a few turbulence to maintain disk stability.</description>

      <title>Investigating Mass Segregation of the Binary Stars in the Open Cluster NGC 6819</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for mass segregation in the intermediate-aged open cluster NGC 6819 within a carefully identified sample of probable cluster members. Using photometry from the Gaia, 2MASS, and Pan-STARRS surveys as inputs for a Bayesian statistics software suite, BASE-9, we identify a rich population of (photometric) binaries and derive posterior distributions for the cluster age, distance, metallicity and reddening as well as star-by-star photometric membership probabilities, masses and mass ratios (for binaries). Within our entire sample, we find 2632 cluster members and 777 binaries. We then select a main-sequence 'primary sample' with 14.85 &lt; G &lt; 19.5 containing 1342 cluster members and 250 binaries with mass ratios q &gt; 0.5, to investigate for mass segregation. Within this primary sample, we find the binary radial distribution is significantly shifted toward the cluster center as compared to the single stars, resulting in a binary fraction that increases significantly toward the cluster core. Furthermore, we find that within the binary sample, more massive binaries have more centrally concentrated radial distributions than less massive binaries. The same is true for the single stars. We verify the expectation of mass segregation for this stellar sample in NGC 6819 through both relaxation time arguments and by investigating a sophisticated N-body model of the cluster. Importantly, this is the first study to investigate mass segregation of the binaries in the open cluster NGC 6819.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS): Linked accretion and ejection in a Class I protobinary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion and ejection sets the outcome of the star and planet formation process. The mid-infrared wavelength range offers key tracers of those processes that were difficult to detect and spatially resolve in protostars until now. We aim to characterize the interplay between accretion and ejection in the low-mass Class I protobinary system TMC1, comprising two young stellar objects: TMC1-W and TMC1-E with 85 au separation. With the {\it James Webb} Space Telescope (JWST) - Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) observations in 5 - 28 $\mu$m range, we measure intensities of emission lines of H$_2$, atoms and ions, e.g., [Fe II] and [Ne II], and HI recombination lines. We detect H$_2$ outflow coming from TMC1-E, with no significant H$_2$ emission from TMC1-W. The H$_2$ emission from TMC1-E outflow appears narrow and extends to wider opening angles with decreasing E$_{up}$ from S(8) to S(1) rotational transitions, indicating a disk wind origin. The outflow from TMC1-E protostar shows spatially extended emission lines of [Ne II], [Ne III], [Ar II], and [Ar III], with their line ratios consistent with UV radiation as a source of ionization. With ALMA, we detect accretion streamer infalling from $&gt;$ 1000 au scales onto the TMC1-E component. TMC1-W protostar powers a collimated jet, detected with [Fe II] and [Ni II] consistent with energetic flow. A much weaker ionized jet is observed from TMC1-E. TMC1-W is associated with strong emission from hydrogen recombination lines, tracing the accretion onto the young star. Observations of a binary Class I protostellar system show that the two processes are clearly intertwined, with accretion from the envelope onto the disk influencing a wide-angle wind ejected on disk scales, while accretion from the protostellar disk onto the protostar is associated with the source launching a collimated high-velocity jet within the innermost regions of the disk.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis of a new fundamental interaction versus the particle oscillation concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant part of the present work is devoted to proving that the basic elements of the particle oscillation concept either do not correspond to the principles of classical logic, or violate the energy-momentum conservation law, or contradict the quantum mechanical basis of coherence, or represent a primitive falsehood. Our analysis concerns successively all stages of the formation of the concept from its conceiving to the assertion about the conversion of the solar electron neutrino into a muon one. When discussing a new fundamental interaction, we note the decisive role in the outcome of the processes of changing the handedness of a neutrino (antineutrino) at each act of its interaction with a real or virtual massless pseudoscalar boson, due to which, at the exit from the Sun, the fluxes of left- and right-handed electron neutrinos become approximately equal. Thanks to the new interaction, beta decays of nuclei have a mode with the emission of a massless pseudoscalar boson, at which the antineutrino changes its handedness and becomes unobservable, what is the essence of the reactor antineutrino anomaly.</description>

      <title>Evaporation Barrier for Dark Matter in Celestial Bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum testable dark matter (DM) mass for almost all DM signatures in celestial bodies is determined by the rate at which DM evaporates. DM evaporation has previously been calculated assuming a competition between the gravitational potential of the object, and thermal kicks from the celestial-body matter. We point out a new effect, where mediators with a range larger than the interparticle spacing induce a force proportional to the density gradient of celestial objects, forming an evaporation barrier for the DM. This effect can be so significant that evaporation does not occur even for sub-MeV DM, in stark contrast to previous calculations. This opens up a wide range of new light DM searches, many orders of magnitude in DM mass below the sensitivity of direct detection.</description>

      <title>BD-14 3065b (TOI-4987b): from giant planet to brown dwarf: evidence for deuterium burning in old age?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study reports the confirmation of BD-14 3065b, a transiting planet/brown dwarf in a triple-star system, with a mass near the deuterium burning boundary. BD-14 3065b has the largest radius observed within the sample of giant planets and brown dwarfs around post-main-sequence stars. Its orbital period is 4.3 days, and it transits a subgiant F-type star with a mass of $M_\star=1.41 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$, a radius of $R_\star=2.35 \pm 0.08 R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6935\pm90$ K, and a metallicity of $-0.34\pm0.05$ dex. By combining TESS photometry with high-resolution spectra acquired with the TRES and Pucheros+ spectrographs, we measured a mass of $M_p=12.37\pm0.92 M_J$ and a radius of $R_p=1.926\pm0.094 R_J$. Our discussion of potential processes that could be responsible for the inflated radius led us to conclude that deuterium burning is a plausible explanation resulting from the heating of BD-14 3065b's interior. Detection of the secondary eclipse with TESS photometry enables a precise determination of the eccentricity $e_p=0.066\pm0.011$ and reveals BD-14 3065b has a brightness temperature of $3520 \pm 130$ K. With its unique characteristics, BD-14 3065b presents an excellent opportunity to study its atmosphere through thermal emission spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, combined with small inaccuracies in the estimated masses of larger asteroids, introduces timing noise for pulsars which is up to 20% of the reported signal at frequencies of ~1/(few-years). The asteroid contribution needs to be modeled better in order to obtain accurate inferences from the PTA signal.</description>
