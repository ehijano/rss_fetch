      <title>Evaluation of drought tolerance of some almond genotypes by morphological, phytochemical and molecular markers in Sulaymaniyah governorate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study was carried out during 2017 to 2019 growing seasons at four locations in Sulaimani governorate and one location in Halabja governorate, in the Iraqi Kurdistan region including SH, M, Q, B and H. A huge number almond trees were observed for all locations, among them 38 trees were selected with the best morphological characteristics which were chosen 9,3,5,7 and 14 trees depending on the locations, respectively. A simple experiment was conducted using RCBD for this experiment and means was separated by Duncans test. In order to evaluate their tolerances to drought in glass house, an experiment was conducted at Department of Horticulture, College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences, University of Sulaimani, that seeds were taken from those genotype trees and stratified then sown in pots. A factorial RCBD experiment was used with two factors genotypes and irrigation intervals. Therefore, thirty eight seedling genotypes grown in pots under glasshouse condition were exposed to three irrigation intervals 10,20 and 40 days after 10 days from seedling emergence. Therefore, the number of treatment combinations was 114 seedlings for each replicate and with a total 342 seedlings for the whole experiment. Analysis of variance was carried out and the means were compared according to LSD 0.05. As a result of the study, the seedlings showed different levels of adaptation to drought that can be used to future breeding programs as rootstocks. The objectives of this study were to identify morphological, phytochemical and genetic diversity with relatedness among the most important almond genotypes in Sulaimani Region which related to drought tolerance to and relationship between morphological, biochemical and molecular data.</description>

      <title>F-BIAS: Towards a distributed national core facility for Bioimage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss in this article the creation and organization of a national core facility for bioimage analysis, based on a distributed team. F-BIAS federates bioimage analysts across France and relies on them to deliver services to the researchers of this territory. The main challenge in implementing this structure is to provide significant scientific value to its members, thereby encouraging their active participation and persuading their respective host teams to support their involvement. F-BIAS accomplished this by creating a professional network that mitigates the negative effects of isolation experienced by its members, who are often the sole bioimage analyst within their local teams, and fosters the development of their technical skills. In a second phase we capitalized on F-BIAS to create a virtual, remotely-operating core facility for bioimage analysis, offering consultations and collaborative project services to the scientific community of France. The services are organized so that they also contribute to the technical proficiency of the analysts. To promote the creation of similar structures, we present and discuss here the organization of this nationally distributed bioimage analysis service core, highlighting successes and challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scientific Reproducibility Through Automated BioCompute Object Creation Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in computational power and accessibility has transformed the complexity and scale of bioinformatics research, necessitating standardized documentation for transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance. The IEEE BioCompute Object (BCO) standard addresses this need but faces adoption challenges due to the overhead of creating compliant documentation, especially for legacy research. This paper presents a novel approach to automate the creation of BCOs from scientific papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We describe the development of the BCO assistant tool that leverages RAG to extract relevant information from source papers and associated code repositories, addressing key challenges such as LLM hallucination and long-context understanding. The implementation incorporates optimized retrieval processes, including a two-pass retrieval with re-ranking, and employs carefully engineered prompts for each BCO domain. We discuss the tool's architecture, extensibility, and evaluation methods, including automated and manual assessment approaches. The BCO assistant demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required for retroactive documentation of bioinformatics research while maintaining compliance with the standard. This approach opens avenues for AI-assisted scientific documentation and knowledge extraction from publications thereby enhancing scientific reproducibility. The BCO assistant tool and documentation is available at https://biocompute-objects.github.io/bco-rag/.</description>
