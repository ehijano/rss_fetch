      <title>Weak isotropy of central simple algebras with orthogonal involutions over totally positive field extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the behavior of orthogonal involutions in the context of totally positive field extensions. Let $K/F$ be a totally positive extension of formally real fields. By Becher's result, if a quadratic form $q$ over $F$ becomes isotropic over $K$, then $q$ is weakly isotropic over $F$. We present an example in which, despite $K/F$ being totally positive, a central simple algebra $(A,\sigma)$ over $F$ with an orthogonal involution becomes isotropic over $K$, while remaining strongly isotropic over $F$. However, when $K/F$ is assumed to be a Galois totally positive $2$-extension of formally real fields, we show that an analogue of Becher's result for quadratic forms holds for orthogonal involutions. Furthermore, for a totally positive Galois field extension $K/F$, we verify Becher's conjecture for central division algebras of index $2^n$ and exponent $2$ containing a subfield of $F_{py}$ of degree $2^{n-2}$ over $F$.</description>

      <title>A characterization of positive roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Root systems are sets with remarkable symmetries and therefore they appear in many situations in mathematics. Among others, denominator formulae of root systems are very beautiful and mysterious equations which have several meanings from a variety of disciplines in mathematics. In this paper, we show a converse statement of this phenomena. Namely, for a given finite subset $ S $ of a Euclidean vector space $ V $, define an equation $ F $ in the group ring $ {\mathbb{Z}}[V] $ featuring the product part of denominator formulae. Then, a geometric condition for the support of $ F $ characterizes $ S $ being a set of positive roots of a finite/affine root system, recovering the denominator formula. This gives a novel characterization of the sets of positive roots of reduced finite/affine root systems.</description>

      <title>Rings in which all elements are the sum of a central element and an element from $\Delta (R)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and consider in-depth the so-called $C\Delta$ rings as those rings $R$ whose elements are a sum of an element in $C(R)$ and of an element in $\Delta(R)$. Our achieved results somewhat strengthen these recently obtained by Ma-Wang-Leroy in Czechoslovak Math. J. (2024) as well as these due to Kurtulmaz-Halicioglu-Harmanci-Chen in Bull. Belg. Math. Soc. Simon Stevin (2019).
  Specifically, we succeeded to establish that exchange $C\Delta$ rings are always clean as well as that exchange CN rings are strongly clean. Likewise, we prove that, for any ring $R$, the ring of formal power series $R[[x]]$ over $R$ is $C\Delta$ if, and only if, so is $R$. And, furthermore, we show that, for any ring $R$, if the polynomial ring $R[x]$ is a $C\Delta$ ring, then $R$ satisfies the K\"othe conjecture. Some other closely related things concerning certain extensions of $C\Delta$ rings are also presented.</description>

      <title>On the classification of centralizers of ODOs: An effective differential algebra approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since the seminal works of Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation.
  The centralizer of an ordinary differential operator $L$ is a maximal commutative ring, the affine ring of a spectral curve $\Gamma$. The defining ideal of $\Gamma$ is described, assuming that a finite set of generators of the centralizer is known. In addition, the factorization problem of $L-\lambda$ over a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $\Gamma$, allows the computation of spectral sheaves on $\Gamma$. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Positivity of generalized cluster scattering diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of combinatorial objects, named tight gradings, which are certain nonnegative integer-valued functions on maximal Dyck paths. Using tight gradings, we derive a manifestly positive formula for any wall-function in a rank-2 generalized cluster scattering diagram. We further prove that any consistent rank-2 scattering diagram is positive with respect to the coefficients of initial wall-functions. Moreover, our formula yields explicit expressions for relative Gromov-Witten invariants on weighted projective planes and the Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of framed stable representations on complete bipartite quivers. Finally, by leveraging the rank-2 positivity, we show that any higher-rank generalized cluster scattering diagram has positive wall-functions, which leads to a proof of the positivity of the Laurent phenomenon and the strong positivity of Chekhov-Shapiro's generalized cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Quillen equivalence for chain homotopy categories induced by balanced pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a balanced pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ in an abelian category, we investigate when the chain homotopy categories ${\bf K}(\mathcal{X})$ and ${\bf K}(\mathcal{Y})$ are triangulated equivalent. To this end, we realize these chain homotopy categories as homotopy categories of certain model categories and give conditions that ensure the existence of a Quillen equivalence between the model categories in question. We further give applications to cotorsion triples, Gorenstein projective and Gorenstein injective modules, as well as pure projective and pure injective objects.</description>
