      <title>Mathematical Justification of a Compressible Two-Phase Averaged System with Temperature but Without Heat Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article concerns the mathematical justification of an averaged system of partial differential equations governing the evolution of a two-phase mixture of heat non-conductive, compressible fluids, in space dimension 1 with periodic boundary conditions. The first step is to write a system of partial differential equations governing the physics at a mesoscopical level where the two phases are separated by sharp interfaces. In a second step we study the behavior of a sequence of solutions corresponding to highly oscillating initial densities and temperatures. The limit of such a sequence is described byan averaged system of partial differential equations that has a different algebraic structure than the mesoscopic model and that reflects the macroscopical properties of the mixture. The originality of the paper consists in the fact that both the density and temperature are allowed to oscillate, so that the limiting model is a six-equation, two-pressures, two-temperatures model. The key point is to show the strong convergence of the stress tensor in $L^2((0, T) \times (0, 1))$. In order to obtain uniform estimates in spite of the presence of oscillating coefficients in the energy equation, we look at solutions with low regularity for the density and the temperature.For the readers convenience, we provide in a separated section the modelization of the mesoscopic system and the formal derivation of the averaged two-phase system. We also provide, at the end of the paper, numerical illustrations comparing the unknowns solving the mesoscopic system and the one satisfying the averaged two-phase system.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation of Steady Surface Capillary Waves on a $2D$ Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct global curves of rotational traveling wave solutions to the $2D$ water wave equations on a compact domain. The real analytic interface is subject to surface tension, while gravitational effects are ignored. In contrast to the rotational surface waves, the fluid flow follows the incompressible, irrotational Euler equations. This model can provide a description for tiny water droplets in breaking waves and white caps. The primary tool we use is global bifurcation theory, via a conformal formulation of the problem. The obtained fluid domains have $m$-fold discrete rotational symmetry, as well as a reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>Calder\'{o}n problem for fractional Schr\"{o}dinger operators on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an analog of the anisotropic Calder\'on problem for fractional Schr\"odinger operators $(-\Delta_g)^\alpha + V$ with $\alpha \in (0,1)$ on closed Riemannian manifolds of dimensions two and higher. We prove that the knowledge of a Cauchy data set of solutions of the fractional Schr\"odinger equation, given on an open nonempty a priori known subset of the manifold determines both the Riemannian manifold up to an isometry and the potential up to the corresponding gauge transformation, under certain geometric assumptions on the manifold as well as the observation set. Our method of proof is based on: (i) studying a new variant of the Gel'fand inverse spectral problem without the normalization assumption on the energy of eigenfunctions, and (ii) the discovery of an entanglement principle for nonlocal equations involving two or more compactly supported functions. Our solution to (i) makes connections to antipodal sets as well as local control for eigenfunctions and quantum chaos, while (ii) requires sharp interpolation results for holomorphic functions. We believe that both of these results can find applications in other areas of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Scattering of the Vlasov-Riesz system in the three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Vlasov-Riesz system of order $\alpha$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is a kinetic model induced by Riesz interactions. We prove small data scattering when $1/2&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and modified scattering when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;1+\delta$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. Moreover, we show the existence of (modified) wave operators for such a regime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence of modified scattering with polynomial correction in kinetic models.</description>

      <title>On the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on numerically approximating solutions to the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation within bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \in \{2,3\}$, with Robin boundary conditions. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in the linear and nonlinear case, emphasizing the importance of small excitations for existence and uniqueness in the nonlinear case. Adopting a multiharmonic formulation, we address the nonlinear propagation's harmonic frequencies. An iteration scheme is devised and its convergence under smallness conditions on the excitation is shown. We explore numerical solution to the resulting system of Helmholtz equations, with a conforming finite element method for its discretization. Using an implementation of the devised methodology, we showcase how acoustic waves propagate within nonlinear media. This study is supposed to enhance our understanding of ultrasound propagation dynamics, crucial for obtaining high-quality images from limited boundary measurements.</description>

      <title>Ekman boundary layers in a domain with topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour  of fast rotating incompressible  fluids with vanishing viscosity, in a  {three dimensional} domain with   topography including the case of land area.  Assuming the initial data is well-prepared, we  prove a convergence theorem     of the velocity fields to a two-dimensional vector field   solving     a linear, damped ordinary differential equation.The proof is based on a  weak-strong uniqueness argument, combinedwith an abstract result implying that the weak convergence of a familyof weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system can be translated into a form of uniform-in-time convergence.This argument yields  strong convergence of the velocity fields, without a precise rate though.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Poincar\'e inequalities on the half-space with singular weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Rellich-Kondrachov type theorems and weighted Poincar\'{e} inequalities on the half-space $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+=\{z=(x,y): x \in \mathbb{R}^N, y&gt;0\}$ endowed with the weighted Gaussian measure $\mu :=y^ce^{-a|z|^2}dz$ where $c+1&gt;0$ and $a&gt;0$. We prove that for some positive constant $C&gt;0$ one has \begin{align*}
  \left\|u-\overline u\right\|_{L^2_\mu(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)}\leq C \|\nabla u\|_{L^2_\mu (\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)},\qquad \forall u\in H^1_\mu(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+) \end{align*} where $\overline u=\frac 1{\mu(\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+)}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+} u\,d\mu(z)$. Besides this we also consider the local case of bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^{N+1}_+$ where the measure $\mu$ is $y^cdz$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to obtain a fundamental $L^p-L^{p'}$ estimate for a class of a strongly damped wave equations where the damping operator is given by $-\delta \Delta$ with $\delta \geq 0$ and the constant in the estimate is independent of the damping parameter $\delta.$ The method used here is based on an estimate of the semigroup associated to the linear equation on the Besov spaces and their elementary properties.</description>

      <title>Superlinear transmission in an indirect signal production chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17248v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the indirect signal production system with nonlinear transmission is considered \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{lll} &amp; u_t = \Delta u-\nabla\cdot(u \nabla v), \\ \displaystyle &amp; v_t =\Delta v-v+w,\\ \displaystyle &amp; w_t =\Delta w-w+ f(u) \end{array} \right. \] in a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ associated with homogenous Neumann boundary conditions, where $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ satisfies $0\le f(s) \le s^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha&gt;0$. It is known that the system possesses a global bounded solution if $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac 4n$ when $n\ge 4$. In the case $n\le 3$ and if we consider superlinear transmission, no regularity of $w$ or $v$ can be derived directly. In this work, we show that if $0&lt;\alpha&lt; \min\{\frac 4n,1+\frac 2n\}$, the solution is global and bounded via an approach based on the maximal Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of a Reaction-Diffusion Epidemic Model with Noncompliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an optimal distributed control problem for a reaction-diffusion-based SIR epidemic model with human behavioral effects. We develop a model wherein non-pharmaceutical intervention methods are implemented, but a portion of the population does not comply with them, and this noncompliance affects the spread of the disease. Drawing from social contagion theory, our model allows for the spread of noncompliance parallel to the spread of the disease. The quantities of interest for control are the reduction in infection rate among the compliant population, the rate of spread of noncompliance, and the rate at which non-compliant individuals become compliant after, e.g., receiving more or better information about the underlying disease. We prove the existence of global-in-time solutions for fixed controls and study the regularity properties of the resulting control-to-state map. The existence of optimal control is then established in an abstract framework for a fairly general class of objective functions. Necessary first--order optimality conditions are obtained via a Lagrangian based stationarity system. We conclude with a discussion regarding minimization of the size of infected and non-compliant populations and present simulations with various parameters values to demonstrate the behavior of the model.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior to the 3D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the long-time behavior of classical solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb R^3$. Our main results and innovations can be stated as follows: Under the assumption that the density $\rho({\bf{x}}, t)$ verifies $\rho({\bf{x}},0)\geq c&gt;0$ and $\sup_{t\geq 0}\|\rho(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty}\leq M$, we establish the optimal decay rates of the solutions. This greatly improves the previous result (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 234 (2019), 1167--1222), where the authors require an extra hypothesis $\sup_{t\geq 0}\|\rho(\cdot,t)\|_{C^\alpha}\leq M$ with $\alpha$ arbitrarily small. We prove that the vacuum state will persist for any time provided that the initial density contains vacuum and the far-field density is away from vacuum, which extends the torus case obtained in (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 55 (2023), 882--899) to the whole space. We derive the decay properties of the solutions with vacuum as far-field density. This in particular gives the first result concerning the $L^\infty$-decay with a rate $(1+t)^{-1}$ for the pressure to the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of vacuum. The main ingredient of the proof relies on the techniques involving blow-up criterion, a key time-independent positive upper and lower bounds of the density, and a regularity interpolation trick.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-uniqueness of weak solutions with continuous energy to the 3D deterministic and stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuity of the kinetic energy is an important property of incompressible viscous fluid flows. We show that for any prescribed finite energy divergence-free initial data there exist infinitely many global in time weak solutions with smooth energy profiles to both the 3D deterministic and stochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the stochastic case the constructed solutions are probabilistically strong.
  Our proof introduces a new backward convex integration scheme with delicate selections of initial relaxed solutions, backward time intervals, and energy profiles. Our initial relaxed solutions satisfy a new time-dependent frequency truncated NSE, different from the usual approximations as it decreases the large Reynolds error near the initial time, which plays a key role in the construction.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps from post-critically finite fractals to the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every continuous map between two compact Riemannian manifolds is homotopic to a harmonic map (HM). We show that a similar situation holds for continuous maps between a post-critically finite (p.c.f.) fractal and a circle. Specifically, we provide a geometric proof of Strichartz's theorem stating that for a given degree and appropriate boundary conditions there is a unique HM from the Sierpinski Gasket (SG) to a circle. Furthermore, we extend this result to HMs on p.c.f. fractals.
  Our method uses covering spaces for the SG, which are constructed separately for HMs of a given degree, thus capturing the topology intrinsic to each homotopy class. After lifting continuous functions on the SG with values in the unit circle to continuous real-valued functions on the covering space, we use the harmonic extension algorithm to obtain a harmonic function on the covering space. The desired HM is obtained by restricting the domain of the resultant harmonic function to the fundamental domain and projecting the range to the circle.
  We show that with suitable modifications the method applies to p.c.f. fractals, a large class of self-similar domains. We illustrate our method of constructing the HMs using numerical examples of HMs from the SG to the circle and discuss the construction of the covering spaces for several representative p.c.f. fractals, including the 3-level SG, the hexagasket, and the pentagasket.</description>

      <title>Generation of chaos in the cumulant hierarchy of the stochastic Kac model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time-evolution of cumulants of velocities and kinetic energies in the stochastic Kac model for velocity exchange of $N$ particles, with the aim of quantifying how fast these degrees of freedom become chaotic in a time scale in which the collision rate for each particle is order one. Chaos here is understood in the sense of the original Sto\ss zahlansatz, as an almost complete independence of the particle velocities which we measure by the magnitude of their cumulants up to a finite, but arbitrary order. Known spectral gap results imply that typical initial densities converge to uniform distribution on the constant energy sphere at a time which has order of $N$ expected collisions. We prove that the finite order cumulants converge to their small stationary values much faster, already at a time scale of order one collisions. The proof relies on stability analysis of the closed, but nonlinear, hierarchy of energy cumulants around the fixed point formed by their values in the stationary spherical distribution. It provides the first example of an application of the cumulant hierarchy method to control the properties of a microscopic model related to kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Diffusion Approximation for Spatiotemporal Hemodynamic Response and Deoxygenated Blood Volume Fraction in Microcirculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and Objective: This article concerns a diffusion-based mathematical model for analyzing blood flow and oxygen transport within the capillaries, emphasizing its significance in understanding the physiological and biochemical dynamics of the cerebrovascular system and brain tissue. The focus of this study is, in particular, on neurovascular coupling and the spatiotemporal aspects of blood flow and oxygen transport in microcirculation. Methods: By adopting a coupled modelling approach that integrates the hemodynamic response function (HRF) with Fick's law and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs), we provide a computational framework for the diffusion-driven transport of deoxygenated and total blood volume fractions (DBV and TBV), essential for understanding blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) applications. Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: By integrating spatiotemporal modelling within a realistic head model derived from high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI, we analyze the complex interplay between blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain tissue dynamics. This inclusion of a realistic head model not only enriches the accuracy of our simulations but is also beneficial for understanding the physiological and hemodynamic responses within the human brain.</description>

Abstract: Comparing invariants from both topological and geometric perspectives is a key focus in index theorem. This paper compares higher analytic and topological torsions and establishes a version of the higher Cheeger-M\"uller/Bismut-Zhang theorem. In fact, Bismut-Goette achieved this comparison assuming the existence of fiberwise Morse functions satisfying the fiberwise Thom-Smale transversality condition (TS condition). To fully generalize the theorem, we should remove this assumption. Notably, unlike fiberwise Morse functions, fiberwise generalized Morse functions (GMFs) always exist, we extend Bismut-Goette's setup by considering a fibration $ M \to S $ with a unitarily flat complex bundle $ F \to M $ and a fiberwise GMF $ f $, while retaining the TS condition.
  Compared to Bismut-Goette's work, handling birth-death points for a generalized Morse function poses a key difficulty. To address this, first, by the work of the author M.P., joint with Zhang and Zhu, we focus on a relative version of the theorem. Here, analytic and topological torsions are normalized by subtracting their corresponding torsions for trivial bundles. Next, using new techniques from by the author J.Y., we excise a small neighborhood around the locus where $f$ has birth-death points. This reduces the problem to Bismut-Goette's settings (or its version with boundaries) via a Witten-type deformation. However, new difficulties arise from very singular critical points during this deformation.To address these, we extend methods from Bismut-Lebeau, using Agmon estimates for noncompact manifolds developed by Dai and J.Y.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Aggregation Diffusion-Equation : Analysis via Dirichlet Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the stochastic aggregation-diffusion equation with a singular drift represented by a monotone radial kernel. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a diffusion process that acts as a weak solution to our equation. This process can be described as a distorted Brownian motion originating from a delocalized point. Utilizing Dirichlet form theory, we prove the existence of a weak solution for a quasi-everywhere point in a state space. However uniqueness is not assured for solutions commencing from points outside polar sets, and explicitly characterizing these sets poses a significant challenge. To address this, we employ the H_2-condition introduced by Albeverio et al.(2003). This condition provides a more thorough understanding of the uniqueness issue within the framework of Dirichlet forms. Consequently the H_2-condition is pivotal in enhancing the analysis of weak solutions, ensuring a more detailed comprehension of the problem. An explicit expression for the generalized Schr\"odinger operator associated with certain kernels is also provided.</description>

      <title>Neural field equations with time-periodic external inputs and some applications to visual processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present a mathematical framework for the study of flickering inputs in visual processing tasks. When combined with geometric patterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical phenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects perceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency. Due to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation theory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our context. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of control theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when driven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover, we study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively linearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral kernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal interactions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual field with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the illusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering frequency and the strength of the inhibition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Subharmonic Dynamics of Spectrally Stable Lugiato-Lefever Periodic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear dynamics of perturbed, spectrally stable $T$-periodic stationary solutions of the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), a damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with forcing that arises in nonlinear optics. It is known that for each $N\in\mathbb{N}$, such a $T$-periodic wave train is (orbitally) asymptotically stable against $NT$-periodic, i.e. subharmonic, perturbations. Unfortunately, in such results both the allowable size of initial perturbations as well as the exponential decay rates of perturbations depend on $N$ and, in fact, tend to zero as $N\to\infty$, leading to a lack of uniformity in the period of the perturbation. In recent work, the authors performed a delicate decomposition of the associated linearized solution operator and obtained linear estimates which are uniform in $N$. The dynamical description suggested by this uniform linear theory indicates that the corresponding nonlinear iteration can only be closed if one allows for a spatio-temporal phase modulation of the underlying wave. However, such a modulated perturbation is readily seen to satisfy a quasilinear equation, yielding an inherent loss of regularity. We regain regularity by transferring a nonlinear damping estimate, which has recently been obtained for the LLE in the case of localized perturbations to the case of subharmonic perturbations. Thus, we obtain a nonlinear, subharmonic stability result for periodic stationary solutions of the LLE that is uniform in $N$. This in turn yields an improved nonuniform subharmonic stability result providing an $N$-independent ball of initial perturbations which eventually exhibit exponential decay at an $N$-dependent rate. Finally, we argue that our results connect in the limit $N \to \infty$ to previously established stability results against localized perturbations, thereby unifying existing theories.</description>

      <title>On a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ type Carleson condition on the nontangential derivative of A for an elliptic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that if the matrix $A$ is independent in the transversal $t$-direction, then we have $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$. In the present paper we improve on the $t$-independece condition by introducing a mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ Carleson type condition that only depends on $\partial_t A$ and show $\omega\in A_\infty(\sigma)$ under this condition. This mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ Carleson type condition applies to elliptic operators not covered by the DKP condition, the $t$-independence condition or the Dini condition.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Uniform Convergence of Time Discretisation Schemes for SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove convergence rates for time discretisation schemes for semi-linear stochastic evolution equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the leading operator $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $S$ on a Hilbert space $X$, and the focus is on non-parabolic problems. The main results are optimal bounds for the uniform strong error $$\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty} := \Big(\mathbb{E} \sup_{j\in \{0, \ldots, N_k\}} \|U(t_j) - U^j\|^p\Big)^{1/p},$$ where $p \in [2,\infty)$, $U$ is the mild solution, $U^j$ is obtained from a time discretisation scheme, $k$ is the step size, and $N_k = T/k$. The usual schemes such as the exponential Euler, the implicit Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson method, etc. are included as special cases. Under conditions on the nonlinearity and the noise, we show
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (linear equation, additive noise, general $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim \sqrt{k} \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (nonlinear equation, multiplicative noise, contractive $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \sqrt{\log(T/k)}$ (nonlinear wave equation, multiplicative noise)
  for a large class of time discretisation schemes. The logarithmic factor can be removed if the exponential Euler method is used with a (quasi)-contractive $S$. The obtained bounds coincide with the optimal bounds for SDEs. Most of the existing literature is concerned with bounds for the simpler pointwise strong error $$\mathrm{E}_k:=\bigg(\sup_{j\in \{0,\ldots,N_k\}}\mathbb{E} \|U(t_j) - U^{j}\|^p\bigg)^{1/p}.$$ Applications to Maxwell equations, Schr\"odinger equations, and wave equations are included. For these equations, our results improve and reprove several existing results with a unified method and provide the first results known for the implicit Euler and the Crank-Nicolson method.</description>
