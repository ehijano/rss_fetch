      <title>New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>Are all Binary Black Holes Detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Following the Universal Time-Delay Distributions? Probably Not</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06352v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.</description>

      <title>The first proper motion measurement of the acceleration regions in the large-scale jets of SS 433 powering the W50 nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on new Chandra ACIS-I observations of the X-ray knots located in the western and eastern lobes of W50 associated with the parsec-scale jets of the Galactic microquasar SS 433. These knots are likely counterparts of the recently detected very-high-energy ($E&gt;100$ GeV) gamma-ray emission by HAWC and H.E.S.S. These findings, together with the ultra-high-energy signal recently reported by the LHAASO collaboration, have established the SS 433/W50 system as a unique jet-driven PeVatron candidate. Combining new and archival Chandra data, we perform the first proper motion search of the X-ray knot structures over a time interval spanning approximately 20 years. We found no statistically significant motion of these knots at the 3$\sigma$ confidence level, and place an upper limit of $&lt;$ 0.019-0.033$c$ (5,800-9,800 km s$^{-1}$) for the speed of the innermost knots at an assumed distance $d=5.5$ kpc. Combined with the velocities reported in the literature, the upstream speed in the shock rest frame would reach several 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that highly efficient particle acceleration, approaching the Bohm limit, is occurring. The absence of significant motion of the knots suggests the presence of a standing recollimation shock, formed by the balance between the jet pressure and the external pressure. This interpretation is consistent with the expected occurrence of such shocks at 20-30 pc from SS 433, matching the location of the observed knots.</description>

      <title>Dual perspectives on GX 17+2: a simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the first simultaneous NICER &amp; NuSTAR spectral and timing study of the Sco-like Z source GX 17+2. The source traced the full Z track during four observations. We detect signatures of relativistic reflection in the broadband spectra and report results using a reflection framework. The disk is relatively close to the innermost stable circular orbit ($\sim$ 1-4 R$_{ISCO}$), which agrees with previous studies of GX 17+2, but the location of the inner disk is farther out in the horizontal branch (HB) and moves inward toward the flaring branch (FB). We find the FB to be the point of closest approach of the disk to the neutron star. We qualitatively conclude that the evolution of the source along the HID is that of a relatively truncated disk in the HB ($\sim$ 4 R$_{ISCO}$) that approaches the neutron star as it goes along the HID towards the normal branch (NB), soft apex (SA), and finally the FB. We attribute the source evolution along the Z track to varying mass accretion rate and disk instabilities. Rms variability increases from the NB towards the SA and then drops to a constant along the FB indicating that the observed variability likely originates from the disk/boundary layer rather than the corona.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the Properties and Evolutionary Fates of Black Hole and Wolf-Rayet X-ray Binaries as Potential Gravitational Wave Sources for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first} time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated. Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$, the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary BH system will merge within the Hubble time.</description>

      <title>Identifying the secondary jet in the RadioAstron image of OJ~287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 136 year long optical light curve of OJ~287 is explained by a binary black hole model where the secondary is in a 12 year orbit around the primary. Impacts of the secondary on the accretion disk of the primary generate a series of optical flares which follow a quasi-Keplerian relativistic mathematical model. The orientation of the binary in space is determined from the behavior of the primary jet. Here we ask how the jet of the secondary black hole projects onto the sky plane. Assuming that the jet is initially perpendicular to the disk, and that it is ballistic, we follow its evolution after the Lorentz transformation to the observer's frame. Since the orbital speed of the secondary is of the order of one-tenth of the speed of light, the result is a change in the jet direction by more than a radian during an orbital cycle. We match the theoretical jet line with the recent 12 $\mu$as-resolution RadioAstron map of OJ~287, and determine the only free parameter of the problem, the apparent speed of the jet relative to speed of light. It turns out that the Doppler factor of the jet, $\delta\sim5$, is much lower than in the primary jet. Besides following a unique shape of the jet path, the secondary jet is also distinguished by a different spectral shape than in the primary jet. The present result on the spectral shape agrees with the huge optical flare of 2021 November 12, also arising from the secondary jet.</description>

      <title>A Giant Peanut-shaped Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Emitter Off the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE), exceeding 100 TeV (10^12 electronvolts), {\gamma}-rays manifests extreme particle acceleration in astrophysical sources. Recent observations by {\gamma}-ray telescopes, particularly by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), have revealed a few tens of UHE sources, indicating numerous Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to PeV (10^15 electronvolts) energies. However, discerning the dominant acceleration mechanisms (leptonic versus hadronic), the relative contributions of specific source classes, and the role of particle transport in shaping their observed emission are central goals of modern UHE astrophysics. Here we report the discovery of a giant UHE {\gamma}-ray emitter at -17.5{\deg} off the Galactic plane - a region where UHE {\gamma}-ray sources are rarely found. The emitter exhibits a distinctive asymmetric shape, resembling a giant "Peanut" spanning 0.45{\deg} \times 4.6{\deg}, indicative of anisotropic particle distribution over a large area. A highly aged millisecond pulsar (MSP) J0218+4232 is the sole candidate accelerator positionally coincident with the Peanut region. Its association with UHE {\gamma}-rays extending to 0.7 PeV, if confirmed, would provide the first evidence of a millisecond pulsar powering PeV particles. Such a finding challenges prevailing models, which posit that millisecond pulsars cannot sustain acceleration to PeV energies. The detection reveals fundamental gaps in understanding particle acceleration, cosmic-ray transport, and interstellar magnetic field effects, potentially revealing new PeV accelerator (PeVatron) classes.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray view of two $\gamma$-ray detected low-luminosity active galactic nuclei: NGC 315 and NGC 4261</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The accretion disk of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) is a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). Our goal is to find evidence of RIAF radiation from LLAGNs with jets and analyze their radiation properties, which also adds samples to future research on LLAGNs. Methods. Weconducted an analysis of the X-ray data obtained from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of NGC 315 and NGC 4261, encompassing both timing and spectral investigations. The joint X-ray spectra of the two LLAGNs were fitted using various functional forms and radiative models in XSPEC. Results. No significant variability on timescales of days is observed for both NGC 315 and NGC 4261. The X-ray continuum emission of NGC 315 is suitable for cutoff power-law (PL) fitting, yielding a cutoff energy of Ecut = 18.45 keV, which is the lowest value found in LLAGNssofar. In contrast, the X-ray continuum of NGC 4261 is composed of two PL components, with no signs of a cutoff energy. A prominent neutral Fe K{\alpha} line is observed in NGC 315, while an ionized Fe XXV line is seen in NGC 4261. The derived reflection fractions are R = 0.61 for NGC 315 and R = 0.18 for NGC 4579. Neither NGC 315 nor NGC 4261 shows evidence of a Compton reflection bump. Conclusions. The X-ray spectral characteristics support the RIAF emission as the dominant origin of the X-rays in both sources, although an additional soft PL component originating from the inner jet is observed in NGC 4261. The higher reflection fraction compared to other LLAGNs, along with the detection of a neutral Fe K{\alpha} line, suggests the existence of a truncated accretion disk with a relatively small radius in NGC 315. Bremsstrahlung radiation appears to be the dominant cooling mechanism for the plasma in NGC315, while Comptonization within the RIAF is more likely responsible for the X-ray emission in NGC 4261.</description>

      <title>Recasting the nature of INTEGRAL hard X-ray transients previously classified as active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new broad-band X-ray results aimed at the identification and characterization of four poorly studied hard X-ray transients discovered by INTEGRAL: IGR J16426+6536, IGR J09446-2636, IGR J21268+6203, and IGR J02447+7046. The key properties and X-ray behavior of these sources have remained largely unknown until now. We investigated the temporal, spectral, and energetic characteristics of their hard X-ray outbursts detected above 20 keV by INTEGRAL. In addition, we performed a systematic analysis of unpublished archival soft X-ray observations below 10 keV, enabling a full exploration of their large INTEGRAL error circles in search of the most likely soft X-ray counterparts. Within their arcsecond-sized X-ray error circles, we identified single optical/near-infrared counterparts for each source. We analyzed their photometric properties to constrain the nature of the systems. Our results show that the X-ray properties of these four transients are inconsistent with the previously proposed extragalactic AGN origin, and instead support a Galactic nature for all of them. Specifically, we propose a very faint X-ray transient classification for IGR J16426+6536, a nearby flaring star for IGR J09446-2636 and IGR J21268+6203, finally a gamma-ray binary nature for IGR J02447+7046.</description>

      <title>1FLAT: a Firmamento-based catalog of AGN in Fermi-LAT high Galactic latitude {\gamma}-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic reassessment of 5,062 high-Galactic latitude gamma-ray sources from the Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalog using Firmamento, a web-based platform for multi-frequency source discovery and analysis. Our goal is to provide an independent evaluation of LAT gamma-ray source associations through alternative spectral and spatial methods that combine recent and legacy survey data, supplemented by human supervision of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), source morphology, flux variability, and template-based comparisons. Firmamento confirms the 4FGL-DR4 and 4LAC-DR3 counterparts or unassociated sources in 4,493 cases (88.8%), demonstrating the robustness of both approaches. Beyond this general agreement, we identify 421 new blazar counterparts among previously unassociated sources, thereby reducing the fraction of unidentified extragalactic Fermi-LAT sources from 25% to 17%. In addition, in 64 cases we find alternative blazar associations, while in 49 instances we do not confirm the 4FGL-DR4 association. For all confirmed blazar counterparts we provide homogeneous estimates of synchrotron peak frequency and peak flux using machine-learning and template-based methods; these agree with 4LAC-DR3 values in most cases, though significant discrepancies appear for a few dozen sources, often due to improved X-ray coverage. The primary outcome of this work is the 1st Firmamento LAT AGN table (1FLAT), made publicly available through the Firmamento platform (https://firmamento.nyuad.nyu.edu), where all related multi-wavelength data and images are available. The project involved extensive manual validation and benefited from the active participation of graduate and undergraduate students, highlighting the platform's value for both research and education.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Temporally Stable Bimodal Energy Distribution of FRB 20121102A with a Tripled Burst Set from AI Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with their large number of bursts, burst energy distribution, and their potential energy evolution, offer critical insights into the FRBs emission mechanisms. Traditional pipelines search for bursts through conducting dedispersion trials and looking for signals above certain fluence thresholds, both of which could result in missing weak and narrow-band bursts. In order to improve the completeness of the burst set, we develop an End-to-end DedispersE-agnostic Nonparametric AI model (EDEN), which directly detect bursts from dynamic spectrum and is the first detection pipeline that operates without attempting dedispersion. We apply EDEN to archival FAST L-band observations during the extreme active phase of the repeating source FRB 20121102A, resulting in the largest burst set for any FRB to date, which contains 5,927 individual bursts, tripling the original burst set. The much enhanced completeness enables a refined analysis of the temporal behavior of energy distribution, revealing that the bimodal energy distribution remains stable over time. It is rather an intrinsic feature of the emission mechanisms than a consequence of co-evolving with burst rate.</description>

      <title>Prolonged fallback and late-time rebrightening episodes in stellar tidal disruptions as imprints of a galactic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07026v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Keplerian framework of existing analytic TDE models by incorporating the gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric galactic mass distribution. We then demonstrate that this broader structure imprints light curve features beyond the predictive scope of traditional models, such as phases of shallower-than-standard decay and late-time rebrightening episodes. Importantly, our framework predicts the occurrence of environment-induced rebrightenings but only on very long timescales, unless the host environment is unrealistically ultra-compact. This means the early evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially untouched by the host potential, which explains why Keplerian models have been so successful in describing the first few years after disruption. To illustrate, we applied our model to the TDE candidate eRASSt J133157.9-324321 (J1331), the event with the longest reported rebrightening interval, and find that even matching its ${\sim}$30-year rebrightening would demand an implausibly dense host. This demonstrates the limits of environmental effects as an explanation for early rebrightenings reported in the literature. More broadly, our work shows that while the host galaxy leaves TDEs nearly Keplerian at early times, it actively shapes their long-term evolution and can drive departures from the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay law. These delayed signals give us a testable way to see how the host galaxy shapes the event, and they may even offer clues about the galaxy's underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Archival Inference for Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Space-Based Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave observatories will detect the early inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes and can track their eccentricity evolution. However, untargeted searches in the space band are computationally demanding and require relatively high detection thresholds (signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 15$). Information from ground-based detections can significantly shrink the parameter space for space-band analyses and thereby substantially reduce the detection threshold. We present a Bayesian inference pipeline for ground-triggered archival space-band analyses that includes eccentricity. Using ground-informed priors, we demonstrate that with one year of LISA or TianQin data a GW190521-like source with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7$ can be distinguished and tightly constrained. In this setup, space observations sharpened the redshifted chirp mass from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})M_\odot$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$, and constrain the eccentricity to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ around the injected value $e_{0.01\mathrm{Hz}}=0.1$. These results demonstrate that inference of eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-band data is practically feasible, supports an expanded yield of multiband detections, and strengthens prospects for future astrophysical and gravitational tests.</description>

      <title>High-energy variability of the gravitationally lensed blazar PKS 1830-211</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production site and process responsible for the highly variable high-energy emission observed from blazar jets are still debated. Gravitational lenses can be used as microscopes to investigate the nature of such sources. We study the broad-band spectral properties and the high-energy variability of the gravitationally-lensed blazar PKS 1830-211, for which radio observations have revealed two images, to put constraints on the jet physics and the existence of a gravitationally-induced time delay and magnification ratio between the images. We utilize Swift/XRT, Nustar, and Fermi-LAT observations from 2016 and 2019 to compare periods of low activity and high activity in PKS 1830-211. Short-timescale variability is elucidated with an unbinned power spectrum analysis of time-tagged NuSTAR photon data. To study the gravitationally-induced time delay in the gamma-ray light curve observed with Fermi-LAT, we improve existing autocorrelation function based methods. Our modified auto-correlation method yields a delay of t_0=21.1 +/- 0.1 d and magnification factor a=0.13 +/- 0.01. These parameters remain time-invariant. In data from 2016 and 2019, the X-ray spectra remain remarkably stable, contrasting with extreme changes in gamma-rays. Both states can be fitted with a single component from Comptonisation of infrared emission from the dusty torus, with different gamma-ray states arising solely from a shift in the break of the electron energy distribution. The detection of a consistent lag throughout the whole light curve suggests that they originate from a persistent location in the jet.</description>

      <title>Testing new-physics scenarios with the combined LHAASO and Carpet-3 fluence spectrum of GRB 221009A: axion-like particles and Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: &gt;10 TeV with LHAASO and &gt;100 TeV with Carpet-3. Such energetic photons are expected to be absorbed via electron-positron pair production on their way to the Earth. Their observation might be explained by new physics, including Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon mixing with axion-like particles (ALPs). Here, we construct a joint fluence spectrum by combining flux measurements from both experiments, and fit it under these hypotheses. LIV can account for the Carpet-3 observation, providing a modest improvement over standard physics in the overall fit. ALP mixing improves the description of both LHAASO and Carpet-3 data, yielding a substantial enhancement in fit quality for a specific region of the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing evolution of Long GRB properties through their cosmic formation history aided by Machine Learning predicted redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are valuable probes of cosmic star formation reaching back into the epoch of reionization, and a large dataset with known redshifts ($z$) is an important ingredient for these studies. Usually, $z$ is measured using spectroscopy or photometry, but $\sim80\%$ of GRBs lack such data. Prompt and afterglow correlations can provide estimates in these cases, though they suffer from systematic uncertainties due to assumed cosmologies and due to detector threshold limits. We use a sample with $z$ estimated via machine learning models, based on prompt and afterglow parameters, without relying on cosmological assumptions. We then use an augmented sample of GRBs with measured and predicted redshifts, forming a larger dataset. We find that the predicted redshifts are a crucial step forward in understanding the evolution of GRB properties. We test three cases: no evolution, an evolution of the beaming factor, and an evolution of all terms captured by an evolution factor $(1+z)^\delta$. We find that these cases can explain the density rate in the redshift range between 1-2, but neither of the cases can explain the derived rate densities at smaller and higher redshifts, which may point towards an evolution term different than a simple power law. Another possibility is that this mismatch is due to the non-homogeneity of the sample, e.g., a non-collapsar origin of some long GRB within the sample.</description>

Abstract: Future gamma-ray survey instruments, such as newASTROGAM and AMEGO-X, will significantly improve previous and current all-sky surveys at MeV energies. In this paper we discuss the continuum emission from the Milky Way, two prominent large extended sources, the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and the extragalactic gamma-ray background. We highlight the importance of measurements in the MeV to GeV energy range for understanding CR production and propagation in the Galaxy, for the determination of the nature of the Fermi bubbles and Loop I, and for exploring the origin of the extragalactic gamma-ray background.</description>

      <title>Preferential Accretion onto the Secondary Black Hole Strengthens Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the rapidly varying white dwarf ZTF 1851+1714</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on phase-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry in the R and B bands of the white dwarf candidate ZTF 185139.81+171430.3. The source has been reported to be variable with a large amplitude of close to 1 magnitude, in the R band, and a short period of 12.37 min. We confirm this period and interpret it as the spin period of the white dwarf. The optical spectrum shows emission lines from hydrogen and helium superposed on a featureless continuum. The continuum changes shape throughout a cycle, such that it is redder when the source is bright. There is tentative evidence for Doppler shifts in the emission lines during the spin cycle with an amplitude of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$. Notably, the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines exhibit different radial velocity amplitudes, suggesting that they come from different emission regions. We also identify a candidate orbital period of 1.00 hr, based on potential orbital sidebands. These features - Doppler shifts modulated at the spin frequency, brightness variations, and continuum shape changes - are consistent with the accretion curtain model, in which material is funneled from a truncated inner disc along magnetic field lines onto the magnetic poles of the white dwarf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations provide a full description of the dynamics of binary systems, including gravitational radiation. The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.</description>

      <title>Classification of $g$-modes for neutron stars with a strong transition: Novel universal relation including slow stable twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the non-radial gravity-pulsation discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) in hybrid compact stars with a strong first-order phase transition, which can give rise to twin-star configurations in some cases. These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.</description>

      <title>Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observations we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.</description>

      <title>Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</description>

      <title>The source of the cosmic-ray excess in the Centaurus region -- constraints on possible candidates, mass composition and cosmic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most significant excess in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim40\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is found in the direction of several interesting source candidates, most prominently the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. Naturally, Cen A has been suspected to create the anisotropy - but very different scenarios have been proposed. This includes a subdominant source contribution in combination with isotropic background sources, as well as a scenario where Cen A supplies the whole cosmic-ray flux above the ankle. Recently, it was suggested that the overdensity could instead consist of strongly deflected events from the Sombrero galaxy. Thanks to the recent development of several models of the Galactic magnetic field, it is now possible to test these proposed scenarios explicitly. Leveraging the measured overdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we place limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number and the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective source and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the overdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\lesssim6$ and the extragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}$ to be between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the dominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim20$. We find that a scenario where all the flux above $30\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is supplied by Cen A or M83 is possible for $20\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim30$ and a mixed composition - explaining both the Centaurus region excess and the distribution of the highest-energy events - however, another contributing source is possibly required in the energy range $&lt;30\,\mathrm{EeV}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a New $\beta$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas using a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown scaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\beta$ environments. Even starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a $\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as $\sigma_\mathrm{max} \tau_a \propto \beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held assumption of $\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This novel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic fields. Increasing plasma-$\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\parallel,0} &lt; p_{\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\parallel,0} &gt; p_{\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Are magnetic fields in cosmic voids primordial?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of magnetic fields in the voids of the large-scale structure of the Universe has been a multifaceted open puzzle for decades. On one hand, their origin is not clear with most of the magnetogenesis models using physics beyond the standard model in the early Universe, and on the other hand, their existence and potential role in explaining the spectra of TeV blazars have been intensely debated in the past decade. Here, we propose a mechanism, within classical electrodynamics, that could fill the voids with late-Universe fields and, under certain conditions, dispel the need for primordial fields altogether to explain the void fields. Specifically, we use the dipole component of the galactic fields to generate space-filling magnetic fields in voids with white-noise spectrum and sufficient amplitude to explain the lack of GeV halos around TeV blazars observed by Fermi-LAT. A definitive test for such fields in the voids will be the white-noise spectral shape, which will constrain possible plasma processes in the voids to the ones that allow for the propagation of these dipole fields into the voids.</description>

      <title>Framework for phase transitions between the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characteristics of the hadron-to-quark first-order phase transition differ depending on whether charge neutrality is locally or globally fulfilled. In $\beta$-equilibrated matter, these two possibilities correspond to the Maxwell and Gibbs constructions. Recently, we presented a new framework in which a continuously-varying parameter allows one to describe a first-order phase transition in intermediate scenarios to the two extremes of fully local and fully global charge neutrality. In this work, we extend the previous framework to finite temperatures and out-of-$\beta$ equilibrium conditions, making it available for simulations of core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We investigate its impact on key thermodynamic quantities across a range of baryon densities, temperatures, and electron fractions. We find that when matter is not in $\beta$-equilibrium, the pressure in the mixed phase is not constant even for the case of fully-local charge neutrality. Moreover, we compute the thermal index using three different approaches, demonstrating that the finite-temperature extension of an equation of state using a constant thermal index can be ill-defined when applied to the mixed phase.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gravitational Wave Modes from the Inspiral of Binaries with Arbitrary Eccentricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eccentric binaries are key targets for current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors, offering unique insights into the formation and environments of compact binaries. However, accurately and efficiently modeling eccentric waveforms remains challenging, in part due to their complex harmonic structure. In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from the inspiral of eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections. Our results provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of eccentric GW emission and practical tools for developing more accurate and efficient waveform models.</description>

      <title>Universality of gravitational radiation from magnetar magnetospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent relative to the potential state, implying that the magnetospheric contribution to the gravitational-wave luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts 'universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G independently of internal deformations.</description>

Abstract: We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case. This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.</description>

      <title>Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs I: Model efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N)~9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF&gt;10 at 7&lt;(S/N)&lt;15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N)~16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N)~12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).</description>
