      <title>Real time synchronisation of a free-running atomic clock time base with UTC using GNSS signals for application in experimental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results obtained by applying, in real-time, a correction method to precisely synchronize a time base generated from a free-running atomic clock with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The method uses the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to have regular time comparisons between the atomic clock generated time base and the GPS Time, perform linear fits of the measurements and extrapolate a correction to apply to the free-running signal. In this work, we apply for the first time this method in real-time. Two atomic clocks were tested, a low-cost Rubidium clock and a more expensive magnetic Caesium clock. We demonstrate that we can obtain a residual difference between the clock time base and the French official realization of UTC (UTC(OP)) in the range of $\pm 15$ ns with no apparent residual drift.</description>

      <title>First Born Approximation of the Single Differential Cross Section (SDCS) for Electron Impact Ionization of H(3s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation is a rigorous theoretical study of the Single Differential Cross Section (SDCS) for the ionization of hydrogen in the 3s state by electron impact computed by means of the First-Born Approximation. The transition matrix has been found by means of the integral process of Bethe-Lewis. The effect of the Coulomb attractive force and the continuum of outgoing radiation have been taken into account in conjunction with the hypergeometric function, which has been used to denote the states of collision. It has hence been possible to deduce the SDCS. for a considerable range of respective incoming electron energies (100 eV to 250 eV). The results show a very distinct marked peak in the rate of ionization taking place for these energies (about 200 eV) with a gradual fall-off after with an increase in energy. The diffuse structure of the wave function in the 3s state serves to a certain extent to make variations in the rate of ionization with that of the incoming electron increased. The final results have been arrived at by means of numerical integrations done so by means of a MATLAB computer, which has yielded very accurate numbers for the cross sections. The results show up very fatally, with experimental results existing at the present date and with theoretical deductions validating the procedure of the FBA. in giving the results of the ionization of excited hydrogen atoms within the field of ionizing processes of electron-atom impact systems. The work gives a most complete basis for the further study of those systems where the processes of ionization and the complexities of the scattering process take place in excited states.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Antihydrogen Production via Slow Plasma Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the time-dependent temperature and density distribution of antiprotons and positrons while slowly combining them to make antihydrogen atoms in a nested Penning-Malmberg trap. The total antihydrogen yield and the number of atoms escaping the trap as a beam are greatest when the positron temperature is lowest and when antiprotons enter the positron plasma at the smallest radius. We control these parameters by changing the rate at which we lower the electrostatic barrier between the antiproton and positron plasmas and by heating the positrons. With the optimal settings, we produce $2.3\times 10^6$ antihydrogen atoms per $15$-minute run, surpassing the previous state of the art -- $3.1\times 10^4$ atoms in $4$ minutes -- by a factor of $20$.</description>

      <title>Precision spectroscopy of the $A^2\Pi$ $\leftarrow$ $X^2\Sigma^+$ transition in BaF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy on the $A^2\Pi$ - $X^2\Sigma^+$ electronic system of $^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F is performed using a cold molecular beam produced by a buffer gas source. The hyperfine structure in both $X^2\Sigma^+$ ground and $A^2\Pi$ excited states is fully resolved and absolute transition frequencies of individual components are measured at the sub-MHz level making use of frequency-comb laser calibration. Sets of molecular constants for the $X^2\Sigma^+$($v=0,1$) and $A^2\Pi$($v=0,1$) levels are determined, with improved accuracy for the $T_{v',v''}$ band origins and spin-orbit interaction constants for the $A^2\Pi$ excited states, that represent the presently measured highly accurate transitions for low-$J$ states as well as previously determined transition frequencies in Fourier-transform emission studies for rotational levels as high as $J \geq 100$. The extracted molecular constants reproduce the measured transition frequencies at the experimental absolute accuracy of 1 MHz. The work is of relevance for future laser cooling schemes, and is performed in the context of a measurement of the electron dipole moment for which BaF is a target system.</description>

      <title>Rejection of wavefront aberrations in an atomic gradiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main residual limitations of inertial sensors based on atom interferometry stems from laser beam distortions, which cause parasitic phase shifts and non-homogeneous matter-light couplings. Here we present numerical simulations, accompanied by analytical calculations, which quantify the impact of these effects in a cold atom gradiometer. We demonstrate that the propagation of interferometric laser beam aberrations, combined with initial asymmetry and significant time-of-flight expansion of the the two atomic sources, limit the common-mode rejection of phase noise in a differential configuration. The resulting deviations in gravitational acceleration and its gradient are within reach of current experimental devices. Our study allows us to evaluate the surface quality requirements for retroreflective optics in cold-atom gradiometers of various baselines, and can be extended to other sensors based on different interferometer geometries.</description>

      <title>Microscopic study of low-lying states in odd-mass nuclei for atomic electric dipole moment searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic study of the low-lying states of five odd-mass nuclei of particular interest for experimental searches of atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs): $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg, $^{225}$Ra, $^{229}$Th, and $^{229}$Pa. The analysis is performed within the recently developed multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT), which incorporates symmetry restoration and configuration mixing based on self-consistent mean-field solutions. The calculated energy spectra and electromagnetic observables of these nuclei are reasonably well reproduced without introducing any parameters beyond those of the underlying universal relativistic energy density functional. The results demonstrate the reliability of MR-CDFT in describing the structure of these nuclei and in providing essential input on nuclear Schiff moments relevant to ongoing EDM searches.</description>

      <title>Quantum optical neural networks using atom-cavity interactions to provide all-optical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.</description>

      <title>Alexander Dalgarno and the development of astrochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interdisciplinary field of astrochemistry arose during the 1970s as observations in previously unexplored parts of the electromagnetic spectrum began to reveal the extent of a molecular component of interstellar matter with a surprisingly rich chemistry. Astrochemistry expanded further in order to explain the role of atomic and molecular processes in a broad range of phenomena in the universe. It is instructive to describe the current scope of astrochemistry using the career and accomplishments of Alexander Dalgarno as an organizing principle. Dalgarno helped to establish a self-sustaining community of astrochemists around the world. His own research interests highlight the early development of astrochemistry and anticipate much of its later evolution. His theoretical investigations of fundamental atomic and molecular processes lie at the heart of the subject.</description>

      <title>Broad Feshbach resonance with a large background scattering length in a fermionic atom-molecule mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a broad magnetic Feshbach resonance with a large background scattering length in an ultracold fermionic mixture of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules and $^{40}$K atoms, with both species prepared in their lowest hyperfine states. The Feshbach resonance is characterized by measuring resonantly enhanced loss rates and elastic scattering cross sections via cross-species thermalization. The large background scattering length can drive the atom-molecule mixture into the hydrodynamic regime when the magnetic field is far from the resonance. We observe that the center-of-mass motions of the atoms and molecules are phase-locked and oscillate with a common frequency due to hydrodynamic drag effects. This broad atom-molecule Feshbach resonance with its large background scattering length opens up a new avenue towards studying strongly interacting fermionic gases with mass imbalance.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in ring condensates subjected to bichromatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</description>

      <title>State-Selective Ionization and Trapping of Single H$_2^+$ Ions with (2+1) Multiphoton Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on efficient rovibrational state-selective loading of single H$_2^+$ molecular ions into a cryogenic linear Paul trap using (2+1) resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI). The H$_2^+$ ions are created by resonant two-photon excitation of H$_2$ molecules from the $X\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state to the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ state, followed by non-resonant one-photon ionization. The H$_2^+$ ions are produced from residual gas and sympathetically cooled by a co-trapped, laser-cooled $^9$Be$^+$ ion. By tuning the wavelength of the REMPI laser, we observe the loading of single H$_2^+$ ions via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 0, 1, 2, 3$) rovibrational levels of the $E,F\;^1\Sigma_g^+$ intermediate state. We measure the success probability for the production of H$_2^+$ in the ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 1$) state via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 1$) level to be 85(6)% by quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) of the hyperfine structure of this rovibrational state. Furthermore, we load an H$_2^+$ ion via the ($\nu' = 0$, $L' = 2$) level and confirm its rovibrational state to be ($\nu^+ = 0$, $L^+ = 2$) by QLS. We perform QLS probes on the ion over 19 h and observe no decay of the rotationally excited state. Our work demonstrates an efficient state-selective loading mechanism for single-ion, high-precision spectroscopy of hydrogen molecular ions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control over rotational angular momentum is at the heart of recent advances in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and quantum computation with ultracold bialkali molecules. Each rotational state comprises a rich manifold of hyperfine states arising from combinations of rotation and nuclear spins; this often yields hundreds of transitions available between a given pair of rotational states, and the efficient navigation of this complex space is a current challenge for experiments. Here, we describe a general approach based on a simple heuristic and graph theory to quickly identify optimal sets of states in ultracold bialkali molecules. We explain how to find pathways through the many available transitions to prepare the molecule in a specific state with maximum speed for any desired fidelity. We then examine networks of states where multiple couplings are present at the same time. As example applications, we first identify a closed loop of four states in the RbCs molecule where there is minimal population leakage out of the loop during simultaneous microwave coupling; we then extend the optimisation procedure to account for decoherence induced by magnetic-field noise and obtain an optimal set of 3 states for quantum computation applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Photon Correlations in Trapped Ion Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</description>

      <title>Collective light shifts of many longitudinal cavity modes induced by coupling to a cold-atom ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the interaction between a cold atom cloud and many longitudinal modes of a high quality Fabry-Perot cavity, by measuring signatures of collective light shifts in the cavity transmission spectrum of an optical frequency comb probe. Using a resonator coupled to more than $10^5$ intracavity atoms, we detect significant shifts of $\sim 100$ cavity modes simultaneously, which is a direct manifestation of physics beyond the hitherto explored regime of cavity-cold atom interaction with only single or few longitudinal modes at a time. For the cavity mode closest to the atomic resonance, we demonstrate a bistability in the transmission spectrum, arising due to a combined coupling of the cloud to an external pump laser and a cavity mode probed by the optical frequency comb. These results establish a platform for deeper exploration of multifrequency cavity quantum electrodynamics, where ultrashort pulsed sources can be used for optical manipulation, cooling and entanglement of cold atoms in a resonator.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with atomic qubit arrays: confronting the cost of connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</description>

      <title>Testing Distinguishability and Determinism in Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test distinguishability and determinism in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if atoms are distinguishable from each other due to small differences in the nuclear magnetic moment. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for stable isotopes that are confined to ion traps, by accumulating statistics over time with different atoms. The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons, lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number of protons and neutrons. We then consider the possibility of performing the same tests on newly created stable isotopes. We also propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of thulium-170 is considered, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.</description>

      <title>Reversing adiabatic state preparation in few-level quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of an adiabatic state preparation in an effective three-level quantum system. States can be prepared with high speed and fidelity by adding a counterdiabatic (CD) quantum control protocol. As a second step, we invert the preparation protocol to get back to the initial state. This describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic terms, the resulting composed fast evolution can be repeated many times. We then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path and show that Berry's phase can act as a sensitive detector of non-perfect state transfer.</description>
