      <title>Sylow branching trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\ge 5$ be a prime and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a finite symmetric group. To every irreducible character of $P$ we associate a collection of labelled, complete $p$-ary trees. The main results of this article describe Sylow branching coefficients for symmetric groups for all irreducible characters of $P$ in terms of some combinatorial properties of these trees, extending previous work on the linear characters of $P$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity free and completely reducible tensor products for $\mathrm{SL}_3(\Bbbk)$ and $\mathrm{Sp}_4(\Bbbk)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $\Bbbk$ of positive characteristic. We consider the questions of when the tensor product of two simple $G$-modules is multiplicity free or completely reducible. We develop tools for answering these questions in general, and we use them to provide complete answers for the groups $G = \mathrm{SL}_3(\Bbbk)$ and $G = \mathrm{Sp}_4(\Bbbk)$.</description>

      <title>Cleft extensions of rings and singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic treatment of Gorenstein homological aspects for cleft extensions of rings. In particular, we investigate Goresnteinness, Gorenstein projective modules and singularity categories in the context of cleft extensions of rings. This setting includes triangular matrix rings, trivial extension rings and tensor rings, among others. Under certain conditions, we prove singular equivalences between the algebras in a cleft extension, unifying an abundance of known results. Moreover, we compare the big singularity categories of cleft extensions of rings in the sense of Krause.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we give an overview of the Plancherel theory for Riemannian symmetric spaces Z = G/K. In particular we illustrate recently developed methods in Plancherel theory for real spherical spaces by explicating them for Riemannian symmetric spaces, and we explain how Harish-Chandra's Plancherel theorem for Z can be proven from these methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum wreath products and Schur-Weyl duality I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14181v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the authors introduce a new notion called the quantum wreath product, which is the algebra $B \wr_Q \mathcal{H}(d)$ produced from a given algebra $B$, a positive integer $d$, and a choice $Q=(R,S,\rho,\sigma)$ of parameters. Important examples {that arise from our construction} include many variants of the Hecke algebras, such as the Ariki-Koike algebras, the affine Hecke algebras and their degenerate version, Wan-Wang's wreath Hecke algebras, Rosso-Savage's (affine) Frobenius Hecke algebras, Kleshchev-Muth's affine zigzag algebras, and the Hu algebra that quantizes the wreath product $\Sigma_m \wr \Sigma_2$ between symmetric groups.
  In the first part of the paper, the authors develop a structure theory for the quantum wreath products. Necessary and sufficient conditions for these algebras to afford a basis of suitable size are obtained. Furthermore, a Schur-Weyl duality is established via a splitting lemma and mild assumptions on the base algebra $B$. Our uniform approach encompasses many known results which were proved in a case by case manner. The second part of the paper involves the problem of constructing natural subalgebras of Hecke algebras that arise from wreath products. Moreover, a bar-invariant basis of the Hu algebra via an explicit formula for its extra generator is also described.</description>

      <title>Commutative avatars of representations of semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we announce the construction and properties of a big commutative subalgebra of the Kirillov algebra, called big algebra, attached to a finite dimensional irreducible representation of a complex semisimple Lie group. They are commutative finite flat algebras over the cohomology of the classifying space of the group. They are isomorphic with the equivariant intersection cohomology of affine Schubert varieties, endowing them with a new ring structure. Study of the finer aspects of the structure of the big algebras will also furnish the stalks of the intersection cohomology with ring structure, thus ringifying Lusztig's q-weight multiplicity polynomials i.e. affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.</description>

      <title>A bijection between support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs in extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an extriangulated category with enough projectives and injectives. We give a new definition of tilting subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$ and prove it coincides with the definition given in [19]. As applications, we introduce the notions of support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs of $\mathscr{C}$. We build a bijection between support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and certain $\tau$-cotorsion pairs. Moreover, this bijection induces a bijection between tilting subcategories and certain cotorsion pairs.</description>

      <title>Representation Rings of Fusion Systems and Brauer Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a saturated fusion system on a $p$-group $S$. We study the ring $R(\mathcal{F})$ of $\mathcal{F}$-stable characters by exploiting a new connection to the modular characters of a finite group $G$ with $\mathcal{F} = \mathcal{F}_S(G)$. We utilise this connection to find the rank of the $\mathcal{F}$-stable character ring over fields with positive characteristic. We use this theory to derive a decomposition of the regular representation for a fixed basis $B$ of the ring of complex $\mathcal{F}$-stable characters and give a formula for the absolute value of the determinant of the $\mathcal{F}$-character table with respect to $B$ (the matrix of the values taken by elements of $B$ on each $\mathcal{F}$-conjugacy class) for a wide class of saturated fusion systems, including all non-exotic fusion systems, and prove this value squared is a power of $p$ for all saturated fusion systems.</description>

      <title>Toric degenerations of cluster varieties and cluster duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.08369v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a $Y$-pattern with coefficients and its geometric counterpart: a cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety with coefficients. We use these constructions to build a flat degeneration of every skew-symmetrizable specially completed cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety $\widehat{\mathcal{X}}$ to the toric variety associated to its $\mathbf{g}$-fan. Moreover, we show that the fibers of this family are stratified in a natural way, with strata the specially completed $\mathcal{X}$-varieties encoded by $\mathrm{Star}(\tau)$ for each cone $\tau$ of the $\mathbf{g}$-fan. These strata degenerate to the associated toric strata of the central fiber. We further show that the family is cluster dual to $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{prin}}$ of Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, and the fibers cluster dual to $\mathcal{A}_t$. Finally, we give two applications. First, we use our construction to identify the Rietsch-Williams toric degeneration of Grassmannians with the Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich degeneration in the case of $\mathrm{Gr}_2(\mathbb{C}^5)$. Next, we use it to link cluster duality to Batyrev-Borisov duality of Gorenstein toric Fanos in the context of mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spherical objects in dimensions two and three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper classifies spherical objects in various geometric settings in dimensions two and three, including both minimal and partial crepant resolutions of Kleinian singularities, as well as arbitrary flopping 3-fold contractions with only Gorenstein terminal singularities. The main result is much more general: in each such setting, we prove that all objects in the associated null category with no negative Ext groups are the image, under the action of an appropriate braid or pure braid group, of some object in the heart of a bounded t-structure. The corollary is that all objects which admit no negative Exts, and for which the self-Hom space is one dimensional, are the images of the simples. A variation on this argument goes further, and classifies all bounded t-structures. There are multiple geometric, topological and algebraic consequences, primarily to autoequivalences and stability conditions. Our main new technique also extends into representation theory, and we establish that in the derived category of a finite dimensional algebra which is silting discrete, every object with no negative Ext groups lies in the heart of a bounded t-structure. As a consequence, every semibrick complex can be completed to a simple minded collection.</description>

      <title>Derived deformation theory of crepant curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper determines the full derived deformation theory of certain smooth rational curves C in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, by determining all higher A_\infty-products in its controlling DG-algebra. This geometric setup includes very general cases where C does not contract, cases where the curve neighbourhood is not rational, all known simple smooth 3-fold flops, and all known divisorial contractions to curves. As a corollary, it is shown that the noncommutative deformation theory of C can be described as a superpotential algebra derived from what we call free necklace polynomials, which are elements in the free algebra obtained via a closed formula from combinatorial gluing data. The description of these polynomials, together with the above results, establishes a suitably interpreted string theory prediction due to Ferrari, Aspinwall-Katz and Curto-Morrison. Perhaps most significantly, the main results give both the language and evidence to finally formulate new contractibility conjectures for rational curves in CY 3-folds, which lift Artin's celebrated results from surfaces.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ in type $D$ and $E$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give a combinatorial model in terms of symmetric cores of the indexing set of the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ (the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in $\mathbb{C}^2$) containing a monomial ideal, whenever $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary dihedral group. Moreover, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, to the binary octahedral group or to the binary icosahedral group, then the $\Gamma$-fixed points of $\mathcal{H}_n$ which are also fixed under $\mathbb{T}_1$, the maximal diagonal torus of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, are in fact $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-fixed points. Finally, we prove that in that case, the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ containing a $\mathbb{T}_1$-fixed point are of dimension $0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we first prove that the maximal ideal of the universal affine vertex operator algebra $V^k(sl_n)$ for $k=-n+\frac{n-1}{q}$ is generated by two singular vectors of conformal weight $3q$ if $n=3$, and by one singular vector of conformal weight $2q$ if $n\geq 4$. We next determine the associated varieties of the simple vertex operator algebras $L_k(sl_3)$ for all the non-admissible levels $k=-3+\frac{2}{2m+1}$, $m\geq 0$. The varieties of the associated simple affine $W$-algebras $W_k(sl_3,f)$, for nilpotent elements $f$ of $sl_3$, are also determined.</description>
