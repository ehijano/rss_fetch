      <title>Mean-field approximations in insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of the insurance liabilities of a cohort of dependent individuals in general requires the solution of a high-dimensional system of coupled linear forward integro-differential equations, which is infeasible for a larger cohort. However, by using a mean-field approximation, the high dimensional system of linear forward equations can be replaced by a low-dimensional system of non-linear forward integro-differential equations. We show that, subject to certain regularity conditions, the insurance liability viewed as a (conditional) expectation of a functional of an underlying jump process converges to its mean-field approximation, as the number of individuals in the cohort goes to infinity. Examples from both life- and non-life insurance illuminate the practical importance of mean-field approximations.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Own Funds for Life Insurers: A Study of Direct, Indirect, and Control Variate Methods in a Risk-Neutral Pricing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) calculation under Solvency II is computationally intensive, relying on the estimation of own funds. Regulation mandates the direct estimation method. It has been proven that under specific assumptions, the indirect method results in the same estimate. We study their comparative properties and give novel insights.
  First, we provide a straightforward proof that the direct and indirect estimators for own funds converge to the same value. Second, we introduce a novel family of mixed estimators that encompasses the direct and indirect methods as its edge cases. Third, we leverage these estimators to develop powerful variance reduction techniques, constructing a single control variate from the direct and indirect estimators and a multi-control variate framework using subsets of the mixed family. These techniques can be combined with existing methods like Least-Squares Monte Carlo.
  We evaluate the estimators on three simplified asset-liability management models of a German life insurer, Bauer's model MUST and IS case from Bauer et al. (2006), and openIRM by Wolf et al. (2025). Our analysis confirms that neither the direct nor indirect estimator is universally superior, though the indirect method consistently outperforms the direct one in more realistic settings. The proposed control variate techniques show significant potential, in some cases reducing variance to one-tenth of that from the standard direct estimator. However, we also identify scenarios where improvements are marginal, highlighting the model-dependent nature of their efficacy.

      <title>The TruEnd-procedure: Treating trailing zero-valued balances in credit data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented for finding the true but latent endpoints within the repayment histories of individual loans. The monthly observations beyond these true endpoints are false, largely due to operational failures that delay account closure, thereby corrupting some loans. Detecting these false observations is difficult at scale since each affected loan history might have a different sequence of trailing zero (or very small) month-end balances. Identifying these trailing balances requires an exact definition of a "small balance", which our method informs. We demonstrate this procedure and isolate the ideal small-balance definition using two different South African datasets. Evidently, corrupted loans are remarkably prevalent and have excess histories that are surprisingly long, which ruin the timing of risk events and compromise any subsequent time-to-event model, e.g., survival analysis. Having discarded these excess histories, we demonstrably improve the accuracy of both the predicted timing and severity of risk events, without materially impacting the portfolio. The resulting estimates of credit losses are lower and less biased, which augurs well for raising accurate credit impairments under IFRS 9. Our work therefore addresses a pernicious data error, which highlights the pivotal role of data preparation in producing credible forecasts of credit risk.</description>
