      <title>On the predictability of springtime ozone depletion events using the ECCC Global Deterministic Prediction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ozone depletion events are recurring phenomena in both polar regions, characterized by significant interannual variability. In this study, the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Global Deterministic Prediction System is used to investigate the medium-range predictability of ozone and weather throughout the anomalous polar ozone depletion events of 2020. The system includes ozone assimilation and makes use of a prognostic ozone field for the computation of heating rates. The ozone scheme uses simplified photochemical modules to represent the impact of both gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions throughout polar ozone depletion events. The study shows that during the Boreal and Austral spring seasons, the predictability of the total ozone column exceeds 10 days and is comparable to the predictability of large-scale weather variables. It also demonstrates that over both polar regions, the inclusion of ozone radiative coupling has a significant impact on the temperature and wind distributions throughout the stratosphere. Over Antarctica, the ozone coupled forecasts are systematically colder at all lead times, which helps eliminate a temperature bias present in the model using climatological ozone. The strength of the polar vortex also increases significantly throughout the lower stratosphere, in better agreement with zonal wind analyses. Over the Arctic the use of an ozone-interactive model also produces significant changes in the temperature and wind forecasts, but the impact on the quality of the weather forecasts is generally neutral. The study shows the overall benefits of using ozone coupled models in the highly perturbed springtime conditions of the polar regions.</description>

      <title>Regional Ocean Forecasting with Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting systems are vital for understanding marine dynamics, which play a crucial role in environmental management and climate adaptation strategies. Traditional numerical solvers, while effective, are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in machine learning have revolutionized weather forecasting, offering fast and energy-efficient alternatives. Building on these advancements, we introduce SeaCast, a neural network designed for high-resolution, medium-range ocean forecasting. SeaCast employs a graph-based framework to effectively handle the complex geometry of ocean grids and integrates external forcing data tailored to the regional ocean context. Our approach is validated through experiments at a high spatial resolution using the operational numerical model of the Mediterranean Sea provided by the Copernicus Marine Service, along with both numerical and data-driven atmospheric forcings.</description>

      <title>Pathways from nucleation to raindrops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud droplets grow via vapor condensation and collisional aggregation. Upon reaching approximately $\approx 100~{\rm \mu m}$, their inertia allows them to capture smaller droplets during descent, initiating rain. Here, we show that raindrop formation is not primarily governed by gravity or thermal diffusion, but by a critical range of drop sizes ($3-30~{\rm \mu m}$) where collisions are largely ineffective and controlled by van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. We identify four pathways to rain. The coalescence pathway, which is slow, involves the broadening of the drop size distribution across the $3-30~{\rm \mu m}$ low-efficiency gap through collisions, until enough large individual droplets achieving efficient collisions have formed. The mixing pathway, which is faster, requires mixing at the cloud top with drop-free, cold, humid air to create locally supersaturated conditions that grow droplets above the low-efficiency gap. The electrostatic pathway bypasses the gap through a static vertical field creating attractive interactions between droplets. The turbulence pathway relies on air turbulence to bring the droplets together at an increased rate, but we show that this pathway is unlikely. For all dynamical mechanisms, we demonstrate that the initiation time for rainfall occurs at the crossover between the broadening of the drop size distribution and the emergence of individual droplets large enough to trigger the onset of the rainfall cascade.</description>

      <title>Oceananigans.jl: A Julia library that achieves breakthrough resolution, memory and energy efficiency in global ocean simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate models must simulate hundreds of future scenarios for hundreds of years at coarse resolutions, and a handful of high-resolution decadal simulations to resolve localized extreme events. Using Oceananigans.jl, written from scratch in Julia, we report several achievements: First, a global ocean simulation with breakthrough horizontal resolution -- 488m -- reaching 15 simulated days per day (0.04 simulated years per day; SYPD). Second, Oceananigans simulates the global ocean at 488m with breakthrough memory efficiency on just 768 Nvidia A100 GPUs, a fraction of the resources available on current and upcoming exascale supercomputers. Third, and arguably most significant for climate modeling, Oceananigans achieves breakthrough energy efficiency reaching 0.95 SYPD at 1.7 km on 576 A100s and 9.9 SYPD at 10 km on 68 A100s -- the latter representing the highest horizontal resolutions employed by current IPCC-class ocean models. Routine climate simulations with 10 km ocean components are within reach.</description>
