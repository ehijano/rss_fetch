      <title>Non-Markovian superposition process model for stochastically describing concentration-discharge relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concentration-discharge relationship is crucial in river hydrology, as it reflects water quality dynamics across both low-and high-flow regimes. However, its mathematical description is still challenging owing to the underlying complex physics and chemistry. This study proposes an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation model that effectively describes the concentration-discharge relationship while staying analytically tractable, along with the computational aspects of the model. The proposed model is based on the superposition of the square-root processes (or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross processes) and its variants, through which both the long-term moments and autocovariance of river discharge and the fluctuation of water quality index can be derived in closed forms. Particularly, the model captures both long (power decay) and short (exponential decay) memories of the fluctuation in a unified manner, while quantifying the hysteresis in the concentration-discharge relationship through mutual covariances with time lags. Based on a verified numerical method, the model is computationally applied to weekly data on total nitrogen (long memory with moderate fluctuation), total phosphorus (short memory with large fluctuation), and total organic carbon (short memory with moderate fluctuation) from a rural catchment to validate its applicability to real-world datasets. Based on the identified model and its mutual covariance, our findings indicate that, on average, the peak concentrations of these water quality indices appear approximately 1 day after discharge. Finally, the study discusses the effects of model uncertainty on mutual covariance.</description>

      <title>Annealed Potts models on rank-1 inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the annealed ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on sparse rank-1 random graphs, where vertices are equipped with a vertex weight, and the probability of an edge is proportional to the product of the vertex weights. In an annealed system, we take the average on both numerator and denominator of the ratio defining the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure of the Potts model. We show that the thermodynamic limit of the pressure per particle exists for rather general vertex weights. In the infinite-variance weight case, we show that the critical temperature equals infinity. For finite-variance weights, we show that, under a rather general condition, the phase transition is {\em first order} for all $q\geq 3$. However, we cannot generally show that the discontinuity of the order parameter is {\em unique}. We prove this uniqueness under a reasonable condition that holds for various distributions, including uniform, gamma, log-normal, Rayleigh and Pareto distributions. Further, we show that the first-order phase transition {\em persists} even for some small positive external field. In the rather relevant case of Pareto distributions with power-law exponent $\tau$, remarkably, the phase transition is first order when $\tau\geq 4$, but not necessarily when the weights have an infinite third-moment, i.e., when $\tau\in(3,4)$. More precisely, the phase transition is second order for $\tau\in (3,\tau(q)]$, while it is first order when $\tau&gt;\tau(q)$, where we give an explicit equation that $\tau(q)$ solves.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for squared increment sums of fractional Brownian fields based on a Delaunay triangulation in $2D$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isotropic fractional Brownian field (with Hurst parameter $H&lt;1/2$) is observed in a family of points in the unit square $\mathbf{C}=(-1/2,1/2]^{2}$% . These points are assumed to come from a realization of a homogeneous Poisson point process with intensity $N$. We consider normalized increments (resp. pairs of increments) along the edges of the Delaunay triangulation generated by the Poisson point process (resp. pairs of edges within triangles). Central limit theorems are established for the respective centered squared increment sums as $N\rightarrow \infty $.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic representation of ODE solutions with quantitative estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the probabilistic representation of the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by the generation of random trees. We present sufficient conditions on equation coefficients that ensure the integrability and uniform integrability of the functionals of random trees used in this representation, and yield quantitative estimates of its explosion time. Those conditions rely on the analysis of a marked branching process that controls the growth of random trees, in which marks can be interpreted as mutant types in population genetics models. We also show how branching process explosion is connected to existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos and Razumikhin theorem for the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov SFDEs with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the limit equations of mean-field particle systems perturbed by common environmental noise, the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with common noise have received a lot of attention. Moreover, past dependence is an unavoidable natural phenomenon for dynamic systems in life sciences, economics, finance, automatic control, and other fields. Combining the two aspects above, this paper delves into a class of nonlinear McKean-Vlasov stochastic functional differential equations (MV-SFDEs) with common noise. The well-posedness of the nonlinear MV-SFDEs with common noise is first demonstrated through the application of the Banach fixed-point theorem. Secondly, the relationship between the MV-SFDEs with common noise and the corresponding functional particle systems is investigated. More precisely, the conditional propagation of chaos with an explicit convergence rate and the stability equivalence are studied. Furthermore, the exponential stability, an important long-time behavior of the nonlinear MV-SFDEs with common noise, is derived. To this end, the It\^o formula involved with state and measure is developed for the MV-SFDEs with common noise. Using this formula, the Razumikhin theorem is proved, providing an easy-to-implement criterion for the exponential stability. Lastly, an example is provided to illustrate the result of the stability.</description>

      <title>Outlier eigenvalues for full rank deformed single ring random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A_n$ be an $n \times n$ deterministic matrix and $\Sigma_n$ be a deterministic non-negative matrix such that $A_n$ and $\Sigma_n$ converge in $*$-moments to operators $a$ and $\Sigma$ respectively in some $W^*$-probability space. We consider the full rank deformed model $A_n + U_n \Sigma_n V_n,$ where $U_n$ and $V_n$ are independent Haar-distributed random unitary matrices. In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalues of $A_n + U_n\Sigma_n V_n$ in two domains that are outside the support of the Brown measure of $a +u \Sigma$. We give a sufficient condition to guarantee that outliers are stable in one domain, and we also prove that there are no outliers in the other domain. When $A_n$ has a bounded rank, the first domain is exactly the one outside the outer boundary of the single ring, and the second domain is the inner disk of the single ring. Our results generalize the results of Benaych-Georges and Rochet (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields, 2016).</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Berry--Esseen bounds for exchangeable pairs with applications to the mean-field classical $N$-vector models and Jack measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a non-uniform Berry--Esseen bound in normal approximation for exchangeable pairs using Stein's method via a concentration inequality approach. The main theorem extends and improves several results in the literature, including those of Eichelsbacher and L\"{o}we [Electron. J. Probab. 15, 2010, 962--988], and Eichelsbacher [arXiv:2404.07587, 2024]. The result is applied to obtain a non-uniform Berry--Esseen bound for the squared-length of the total spin in the mean-field classical $N$-vector models, and a non-uniform Berry--Esseen bound for Jack deformations of the character ratio.</description>

      <title>Robust construction of the incipient infinite cluster in high dimensional critical percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the incipient infinite cluster (IIC) associated with high-dimensional percolation in a broad setting and under minimal assumptions. Our arguments differ substantially from earlier constructions of the IIC; we do not directly use the machinery of the lace expansion or similar diagrammatic expansions. We show that the IIC may be constructed by conditioning on the cluster of a vertex being infinite in the supercritical regime $p &gt; p_c$ and then taking $p \searrow p_c$. Furthermore, at criticality, we show that the IIC may be constructed by conditioning on a connection to an arbitrary distant set $V$, generalizing previous constructions where one conditions on a connection to a single distant vertex or the boundary of a large box.
  The input to our proof are the asymptotics for the two-point function obtained by Hara, van der Hofstad, and Slade. Our construction thus applies in all dimensions for which those asymptotics are known, rather than an unspecified high dimension considered in previous works. The results in this paper will be instrumental in upcoming work related to structural properties and scaling limits of various objects involving high-dimensional percolation clusters at and near criticality.</description>

      <title>First passage times with fast immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many scientific questions can be framed as asking for a first passage time (FPT), which generically describes the time it takes a random "searcher" to find a "target." The important timescale in a variety of biophysical systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) to find a target out of many searchers. Previous work on such fastest FPTs assumes that all searchers are initially present in the domain, which makes the problem amenable to extreme value theory. In this paper, we consider an alternative model in which searchers progressively enter the domain at a constant "immigration" rate. In the fast immigration rate limit, we determine the probability distribution and moments of the $k$-th fastest FPT. Our rigorous theory applies to many models of stochastic motion, including random walks on discrete networks and diffusion on continuous state spaces. Mathematically, our analysis involves studying the extrema of an infinite sequence of random variables which are both not independent and not identically distributed. Our results constitute a rare instance in which extreme value statistics can be determined exactly for strongly correlated random variables.</description>

      <title>Convergence of rescaled "true" self-avoiding walks to the T\'oth-Werner "true" self-repelling motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the rescaled ``true'' self-avoiding walk $(n^{-2/3}X_{\lfloor nt \rfloor})_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ converges weakly as $n$ goes to infinity to the ``true'' self-repelling motion constructed by T\'oth and Werner. The proof features a joint generalized Ray-Knight theorem for the rescaled local times processes and their merge and absorption points as the main tool for showing both the tightness and convergence of the finite dimensional distributions. Thus, our result can be seen as an example of establishing a functional limit theorem for a family of processes by inverting the joint generalized Ray-Knight theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives a new numerical method for approximating Free Stochastic Differential Equations with strong convergence order one. Previously, the authors derived a free variant of the Euler-Maruyama method, which obeys strong convergence order of 0.5. In this paper these results are extended using multiple operator integrals and Taylor expansion of Operator Functions. The new method can be viewed as the free variant of the Milstein-Method for Stochastic Differential Equations. In addition, we generalize the results of the free Euler-Maruyama method to Lp({\phi}), 1 \leq p \leq \infty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two-sided, global (in all variables) estimates of the heat kernel and the Green function of the fractional Schr\"odinger operator with a non-negative and locally bounded potential $V$ such that $V(x) \to \infty$ as $|x| \to \infty$. We assume that $V$ is comparable to a radial profile with the doubling property. Our bounds are sharp with respect to spatial variables and qualitatively sharp with respect to time. The methods we use combine probabilistic and analytic arguments. They are based on the strong Markov property and the Feynman--Kac formula.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic version of the Chung-Lu random graph in which the edges alternate between being present and absent.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a nonlinear version of the Yosida approximation to establish the existence and uniqueness of both (probabilistically) weak and strong solutions and demonstrate the continuous dependence on initial values for a class of multi-valued stochastic evolution inclusions within the variational framework. Furthermore, leveraging this generalized Yosida approximation, we derive the finite-time extinction of solutions with probability one for multi-valued stochastic evolution inclusions perturbed by linear multiplicative noise. The main results are applicable to various examples, including multi-valued stochastic porous media equations, stochastic $\Phi$-Laplace equations and stochastic evolution inclusions involving subdifferentials.</description>

      <title>An introduction to random rule-based chemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce in this article a random model of reactivity in which a primitive rule, if accepted, generates an infinite number of rules by context derivation. The model may be thought of as a toy model of chemical reactivity, where reactions are accepted if their randomly distributed activation energy is below a certain threshold. It may be simulated by induction on the level (length of the word). We describe some statistical features of the model, regarding the number and complexity of the rules, and the shape of the reaction network. The complexity index of a rule is defined as the number of covalent bonds involved in the rearrangement. The Bernoulli parameter (acceptation probability) of the rules is chosen as fixed in a first model (Model I), and exponentially decreasing in the complexity index in a second one (Model II). The two models have very different behaviors, Model II exhibiting a non-trivial phase diagram. The main tool for mathematical analysis is an approximate mapping to a Galton-Watson tree with generation-dependent progeny distributions. Detailed simulations, demonstrating a general agreement with theoretical estimates, are provided at the end. Extensions to realistic bond formation/breaking rules for molecules will be presented elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Optimal recovery of correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two unlabeled graphs $G_1,G_2$ independently sub-sampled from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph $\mathbf G(n,p)$ by keeping each edge with probability $s$, we aim to recover \emph{as many as possible} of the corresponding vertex pairs. We establish a connection between the recoverability of vertex pairs and the balanced load allocation in the true intersection graph of $ G_1 $ and $ G_2 $. Using this connection, we analyze the partial recovery regime where $ p = n^{-\alpha + o(1)} $ for some $ \alpha \in (0, 1] $ and $ nps^2 = \lambda = O(1) $. We derive upper and lower bounds for the recoverable fraction in terms of $ \alpha $ and the limiting load distribution $ \mu_\lambda $ (as introduced in \cite{AS16}). These bounds coincide asymptotically whenever $ \alpha^{-1} $ is not an atom of $ \mu_\lambda $. Therefore, for each fixed $ \lambda $, our result characterizes the asymptotic optimal recovery fraction for all but countably many $ \alpha \in (0, 1] $.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional long-range statistical mechanical models have random walk correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider long-range percolation, Ising model, and self-avoiding walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, with couplings decaying like $|x|^{-(d+\alpha)}$ where $0 &lt; \alpha \le 2$, above the upper critical dimensions. In the spread-out setting where the lace expansion applies, we show that the two-point function for each of these models exactly coincides with a random walk two-point function, up to a constant prefactor. Using this, we prove a uniform upper bound of the form $|x|^{-(d-\alpha)} \min\{ 1, (p_c - p)^{-2} |x|^{-2\alpha} \}$ (with logarithmic corrections if $\alpha = 2$) for the two-point function near the critical point $p_c$. We also give a simple proof of the convergence of the lace expansion, assuming diagrammatic estimates.</description>

      <title>Lifetime Analysis of Circular $k$-out-of-$n$: G Balanced Systems in a Shock Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the lifetime distributions of circular $k$-out-of-$n$: G balanced systems operating in a shock environment, providing a unified framework for both discrete- and continuous-time perspectives. The system remains functioning only if at least $k$ operating units satisfy a predefined balance condition (BC). Building on this concept, we demonstrate that the shock numbers to failure (SNTF) follow a discrete phase-type distribution by modeling the system's stochastic dynamics with a finite Markov chain and applying BC-based state space consolidation. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient method for directly computing multi-step transition probabilities of the underlying Markov chain. Next, assuming the inter-arrival times between shocks follow a phase-type distribution, we establish that the continuous-time system lifetime, or the time to system failure (TTF), also follows a phase-type distribution with different parameters. Extensive numerical studies illustrate the impact of key parameters-such as the number of units, minimum requirement of the number of operating units, individual unit reliability, choice of balance condition, and inter-shock time distribution-on the SNTF, TTF, and their variability.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of a Greedy Algorithm for Conditioning Gaussian Random Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Gaussian conditioning, greedy algorithms iteratively select the most informative measurements, given an observed Gaussian random variable. However, the convergence analysis for conditioning Gaussian random variables remains an open problem. We adress this by introducing an operator $M$ that allows us to transfer convergence rates of the observed Gaussian random variable approximation onto the conditional Gaussian random variable. Furthermore we apply greedy methods from approximation theory to obtain convergence rates. These greedy methods have already demonstrated optimal convergence rates within the setting of kernel based function approximation. In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the convergence rates concerning the norm of the approximation error of the conditional covariance operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we proved that the reverse Riesz transform on the graphical Sierpinski gasket is unbounded on $L^p$ for $p\in (1,2)$. Together with previous results, it shows that the Riesz transform on the graphical Sierpinski gasket is bounded on $L^p$ if and only if $p\in (1,2]$ and the reverse Riesz transform is bounded on $L^p$ if and only if $p\in [2,\infty)$.
  Moreover, our method is quite flexible - but requires explicit computations - and hints to the fact that the reverse Riesz transforms is never bounded on $L^p$, $p\in (1,2)$, on graphs with slow diffusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the moment monotonicity property of Weibull, Gamma, and Log-normal distributions. We provide the first complete mathematical proofs for the monotonicity of the function $E(X^n)^{\frac{1}{n}}$ specific to these distributions. Through the derivations, we identify a key property: in many cases, one of the two parameters defining each distribution can be effectively canceled out. This finding opens up opportunities for improved parameter estimation of these random variables. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of these widely used distributions and offer valuable insights for applications in fields such as reliability engineering, econometrics, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>A linear-time algorithm computing the resident fitness in interacting trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1.
  We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</description>

Abstract: We characterize exactness of a countable group $\Gamma$ in terms of invariant random equivalence relations (IREs) on $\Gamma$. Specifically, we show that $\Gamma$ is exact if and only if every weak limit of finite IREs is an amenable IRE. In particular, for exact groups this implies amenability of the restricted rerooting relation associated to the ideal Bernoulli Voronoi tessellation, the discrete analog of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tesselation.</description>

      <title>On the Locality of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz Local Lemma is a versatile result in probability theory, characterizing circumstances in which a collection of $n$ `bad events', each occurring with probability at most $p$ and dependent on a set of underlying random variables, can be avoided. It is a central tool of the probabilistic method, since it can be used to show that combinatorial objects satisfying some desirable properties must exist. While the original proof was existential, subsequent work has shown algorithms for the Lov\'asz Local Lemma: that is, in circumstances in which the lemma proves the existence of some object, these algorithms can constructively find such an object. One main strand of these algorithms, which began with Moser and Tardos's well-known result (JACM 2010), involves iteratively resampling the dependent variables of satisfied bad events until none remain satisfied.
  In this paper, we present a novel analysis that can be applied to resampling-style Lov\'asz Local Lemma algorithms. This analysis shows that an output assignment for the dependent variables of most events can be determined only from $O(\log \log_{1/p} n)$-radius local neighborhoods, and that the events whose variables may still require resampling can be identified from these neighborhoods. This allows us to improve randomized complexities for the constructive Lov\'asz Local Lemma (with polynomial criterion) in several parallel and distributed models. In particular, we obtain:
  1) A LOCAL algorithm with $O(\log\log_{1/p} n)$ node-averaged complexity (while matching the $O(\log_{1/p} n)$ worst-case complexity of Chung, Pettie, and Su).
  2) An algorithm for the LCA and VOLUME models requiring $d^{O(\log\log_{1/p} n)}$ probes per query.
  3) An $O(\log\log\log_{1/p} n)$-round algorithm for CONGESTED CLIQUE, linear space MPC, and Heterogenous MPC.</description>

      <title>Private Synthetic Graph Generation and Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are popular for representing complex data. In particular, differentially private synthetic networks are much in demand for method and algorithm development. The network generator should be easy to implement and should come with theoretical guarantees. Here we start with complex data as input and jointly provide a network representation as well as a synthetic network generator. Using a random connection model, we devise an effective algorithmic approach for generating attributed synthetic graphs which is $\epsilon$-differentially private at the vertex level, while preserving utility under an appropriate notion of distance which we develop. We provide theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of the private synthetic graphs using the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance, which extends the Wasserstein metric to structured data. Our method draws inspiration from the PSMM method of \citet{he2023}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>

      <title>Coupled Ising-Potts Model: Rich Sets of Critical Temperatures and Translation-Invariant Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled Ising-Potts model on Cayley trees of order $ k \geq 2 $. This model involves spin vectors $ (s, \sigma) $, and generalizes both the Ising and Potts models by incorporating interactions between two types of spins: $s = \pm 1$ and $\sigma = 1, \dots, q$. It is applicable to a wide range of systems, including multicomponent alloys, spin glasses, biological systems, networks, and social models.
  In this paper, we find some translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) and show, for $k\geq 2$, that at sufficiently low temperatures, the number of such measures is at least $2^{q}+1$. This is not an exact upper bound; for $k=2$ and $q=5$, we demonstrate that the number of TISGMs reaches the exact bound of 335, which is much larger than $2^5+1=33$. We prove, for $q=5$ that there are 12 critical temperatures at which the number of TISGMs changes, and we provide the exact number of TISGMs for each intermediate temperature. Additionally, we identify temperature regions where three TISGMs, close to the free measure, are either extreme or non-extreme among all Gibbs measures.
  We also show that the coupled Ising-Potts model exhibits properties absent in the individual Ising and Potts models. In particular, we observe the following new phenomena:
  1. In both the Ising and Potts models, if a Gibbs measure exists at some temperature $T_0$, then it exists for all $T&lt;T_0$. However, in the coupled Ising-Potts model, some TISGMs may only exist at intermediate temperatures (neither very low nor very high).
  2. The 5-state Potts model has three critical temperatures and up to 31 TISGMs. We show that for $q=5$, the coupled Ising-Potts model has four times as many critical temperatures and approximately 11 times as many TISGMs. Thus, our model modifies the phase structure more rapidly and exhibits a significantly richer class of splitting Gibbs measures.</description>

Abstract: We study some combinatorial statistics defined on the set NC^{mton}(n) of monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions of {1,...,n}, and on the set NC_2^{mton}(2n)$ of monotonically ordered non-crossing pair-partitions of {1,...,2n}. An important fact used in the calculations is that one has a natural and very convenient structure of rooted tree on the union of the NC^{mton}(n)'s, and likewise for the union of the NC_2^{mton}(2n)'s. Unlike in the analogous results known for unordered non-crossing partitions, the computations of expectations and variances for natural block-counting statistics on NC^{mton}(n) and for the expectation of the area statistic on NC_2^{mton}(2n) turn out to yield a logarithmic regime.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a variational formulation for a general class of possibly degenerate, non-self-adjoint Fokker-Planck operators in divergence form, motivated by the work of Albritton et al. (2024), and prove that it is suitable for defining the variational capacity. Using this framework, we establish rough estimates for the equilibrium potential in the elliptic case, providing a novel approach compared to previous methods. Finally, we derive the Eyring-Kramers formula for non-self-adjoint elliptic Fokker-Planck operators in divergence form, extending the results of Landim et al. (2019) and Lee &amp; Seo (2022).</description>

Abstract: We find information geometry of tempered stable processes. Starting with the derivation of $\alpha$-divergence between two tempered stable processes, Fisher information matrices of tempered stable processes and $\alpha$-connections of their statistical manifolds are obtained. Additionally, we also provide statistical applications for the information geometry of tempered stable processes. Various tempered stable processes such as generalized tempered stable processes, classical tempered stable processes, and rapidly decreasing tempered stable processes are given as examples.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev paths on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem. Given a prescribed family of time-dependent probability measures $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy. After discussing a sufficient condition for the energy to ensure the existence of a minimizer, we investigate fractional Sobolev energies. Given a deterministic path $(\mu_t)$ on a $p$-Wasserstein space with fractional Sobolev regularity $W^{\alpha,p}$, where $1/p &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we provide conditions under which we prove the existence of a process that minimizes the energy and construct a process that realizes the regularity of $(\mu_t)$. While continuous paths of low regularity on Wasserstein spaces naturally appear in stochastic analysis, they can also arise deterministically as solutions to the continuity equation. This paper is devoted to the deterministic setting to gain some understanding of the required conditions.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of finite high-dimensional random arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional random array on a nonempty set $I$ is a stochastic process $\boldsymbol{X}=\langle X_s:s\in \binom{I}{d}\rangle$ indexed by the set $\binom{I}{d}$ of all $d$-element subsets of $I$. We obtain structural decompositions of finite, high-dimensional random arrays whose distribution is invariant under certain symmetries.
  Our first main result is a distributional decomposition of finite, (approximately) spreadable, high-dimensional random arrays whose entries take values in a finite set; the two-dimensional case of this result is the finite version of an infinitary decomposition due to Fremlin and Talagrand. Our second main result is a physical decomposition of finite, spreadable, high-dimensional random arrays with square-integrable entries that is the analogue of the Hoeffding/Efron--Stein decomposition. All proofs are effective.
  We also present applications of these decompositions in the study of concentration of functions of finite, high-dimensional random arrays.</description>

      <title>Right-Most Position of a Last Progeny Modified Branching Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.02880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a modification of the usual Branching Random Walk (BRW), where we give certain independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) displacements to all the particles at the $n$-th generation, which may be different from the driving increment distribution. We call this process last progeny modified branching random walk (LPM-BRW). Depending on the value of a parameter, $\theta$, we classify the model in three distinct cases, namely, the boundary case, below the boundary case, and above the boundary case. Under very minimal assumptions on the underlying point process of the increments, we show that at the boundary case, $\theta=\theta_0$, where $\theta_0$ is a parameter value associated with the displacement point process, the maximum displacement converges to a limit after only an appropriate centering, which is of the form $c_1 n - c_2 \log n$. We give an explicit formula for the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ and show that $c_1$ is exactly the same, while $c_2$ is $1/3$ of the corresponding constants of the usual BRW Aidekon (2013). We also characterize the limiting distribution. We further show that below the boundary, $\theta &lt; \theta_0$, the logarithmic correction term is absent. For above the boundary case, $\theta &gt; \theta_0$, the logarithmic correction term is exactly the same as that of the classical BRW. For $\theta \leq \theta_0$, we further derive Brunet-Derrida -type results of point process convergence of our LPM-BRW to a Poisson point process. Our proofs are based on a novel method of coupling the maximum displacement with a linear statistic associated with a more well-studied process in statistics, known as the smoothing transformation.</description>

      <title>The moduli of annuli in random conformal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain exact formulae for three basic quantities in random conformal geometry that depend on the modulus of an annulus. The first is for the law of the modulus of the Brownian annulus describing the scaling limit of uniformly sampled planar maps with annular topology, which is as predicted from the ghost partition function in bosonic string theory. The second is for the law of the modulus of the annulus bounded by a loop of a simple conformal loop ensemble (CLE) on a disk and the disk boundary. The formula is as conjectured from the partition function of the O$(n)$ loop model on the annulus derived by Saleur-Bauer (1989) and Cardy (2006). The third is for the annulus partition function of the SLE$_{8/3}$ loop introduced by Werner (2008), {confirming another} prediction of Cardy (2006). The physics principle underlying our proofs is that 2D quantum gravity coupled with conformal matters can be decomposed into three conformal field theories (CFT): the matter CFT, the Liouville CFT, and the ghost CFT. At the technical level, we rely on two types of integrability in Liouville quantum gravity, one from the scaling limit of random planar maps, the other from the Liouville CFT.</description>

Abstract: We derive a lower bound for moments of random chaoses of order two with coefficients in arbitrary Banach space F generated by independent symmetric random variables with logarithmically concave tails (which is probably two-sided). We also provide two upper bounds for moments of such chaoses when F = L_q. The first is true under the additional subgaussanity assumption. The second one does not require additional assumptions but is not optimal in general. Both upper bounds are sufficient for obtaining two-sided moment estimates for chaoses with values in Lq generated by Weibull random variables with shape parameter greater or equal to 1.</description>

Abstract: The triangle switch Markov chain is designed to generate random graphs with given degree sequence, but having more triangles than would appear under the uniform distribution. Transition probabilities of the chain depends on a parameter, called the activity, which is used to assign higher stationary probability to graphs with more triangles. In previous work we proved ergodicity of the triangle switch chain for regular graphs. Here we prove ergodicity for all sequences with minimum degree at least 3, and show rapid mixing of the chain when the activity and the maximum degree are not too large.</description>

      <title>Genetic Composition of Supercritical Branching Populations under Power Law Mutation Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to understand the evolution of the genetic composition of cancer cell populations. To achieve this, we consider an individual-based model representing a cell population where cells divide, die and mutate along the edges of a finite directed graph $(V,E)$. The process starts with only one cell of trait $0$. Following typical parameter values in cancer cell populations we study the model under power law mutation rates, in the sense that the mutation probabilities are parametrized by negative powers of a scaling parameter $n$ and the typical sizes of the population of interest are positive powers of $n$. Under a non-increasing growth rate condition, we describe the time evolution of the first-order asymptotics of the size of each subpopulation in the $\log(n)$ time scale, as well as in the random time scale at which the wild-type population, resp. the total population, reaches the size $n^{t}$. In particular, such results allow for the perfect characterization of evolutionary pathways. Without imposing any conditions on the growth rates, we describe the time evolution of the order of magnitude of each subpopulation, whose asymptotic limits are positive non-decreasing piecewise linear continuous functions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for the $XY$ model in non-uniformly elliptic and Poisson-Voronoi environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to analyze how the celebrated phase transitions of the $XY$ model are affected by the presence of a non-elliptic quenched disorder.
  In dimension $d=2$, we prove that if one considers an $XY$ model on the infinite cluster of a supercritical percolation configuration, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition still occurs despite the presence of quenched disorder. The proof works for all $p&gt;p_c$ (site or edge). We also show that the $XY$ model defined on a planar Poisson-Voronoi graph also undergoes a BKT phase transition.
  When $d\geq 3$, we show in a similar fashion that the continuous symmetry breaking of the $XY$ model at low enough temperature is not affected by the presence of quenched disorder such as supercritical percolation (in $\mathbb{Z}^d$) or Poisson-Voronoi (in $\mathbb{R}^d$).
  Adapting either Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer's proof of existence of a BKT phase transition or the more recent proofs of Lammers, van Engelenburg-Lis and Aizenman-Harel-Peled-Shapiro to such non-uniformly elliptic disorders appears to be non-trivial. Instead, our proofs rely on a relatively little known correlation inequality called Wells' inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time bounds for a stochastic hybrid system with fast periodic sampling and small white-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior, uniform-in-time, of a non-linear dynamical system under the combined effects of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small white noise of size $\varepsilon,\thinspace 0&lt;\varepsilon,\delta \ll 1$. The dynamics depend on both the current and recent measurements of the state, and as such it is not Markovian. Our main results can be interpreted as Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type results. LLN type result shows that the resulting stochastic process is close to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) uniformly in time as $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0.$ Further, in regards to CLT, we provide quantitative and uniform-in-time control of the fluctuations process. The interaction of the small parameters provides an additional drift term in the limiting fluctuations, which captures both the sampling and noise effects. As a consequence, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process along with time-independent estimates on the remainder. The zeroth- and first-order terms in the expansion are given by an ODE and SDE, respectively. Simulation studies that illustrate and supplement the theoretical results are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(Y_n)_n$ be a sequence of $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued random variables. Suppose that the generating function \[f(x, z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \varphi_{Y_n}(x) z^n,\] where $\varphi_{Y_n}$ is the characteristic function of $Y_n$, extends to a function on a neighborhood of $\{0\} \times \{z : |z| \leq 1\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{C}$ which is meromorphic in $z$ and has no zeroes. We prove that if $1 / f(x, z)$ is twice differentiable, then there exists a constant $\mu$ such that the distribution of $(Y_n - \mu n) / \sqrt{n}$ converges weakly to a normal distribution as $n \to \infty$.
  If $Y_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$, where $(X_n)_n$ are i.i.d. random variables, then we recover the classical (Lindeberg$\unicode{x2013}$L\'evy) central limit theorem. We also prove the 2020 conjecture of Defant that if $\pi_n \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ is a uniformly random permutation, then the distribution of $(\operatorname{des} (s(\pi_n)) + 1 - (3 - e) n) / \sqrt{n}$ converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a normal distribution with variance $2 + 2e - e^2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Random Quadratic Transportation Costs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the validity of asymptotic limits for the general transportation problem between random i.i.d. points and their common distribution, with respect to the squared Euclidean distance cost, in any dimension larger than three. Previous results were essentially limited to the two (or one) dimensional case, or to distributions whose absolutely continuous part is uniform.
  The proof relies upon recent advances in the stability theory of optimal transportation, combined with functional analytic techniques and some ideas from quantitative stochastic homogenization. The key tool we develop is a quantitative upper bound for the usual quadratic optimal transportation problem in terms of its boundary variant, where points can be freely transported along the boundary. The methods we use are applicable to more general random measures, including occupation measure of Brownian paths, and may open the door to further progress on challenging problems at the interface of analysis, probability, and discrete mathematics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volterra Equations for Local Times of Spectrally Positive L\'evy Processes with Gaussian Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following our previous work [68], this paper continues to investigate the evolution dynamics of local times of spectrally positive L\'evy processes with Gaussian components in the spatial direction. We prove that conditioned on the finiteness of the first time at which the local time at zero exceeds a given value, local times at positive line are equal in law to the unique solution of a stochastic Volterra equation driven by a Gaussian white noise and two Poisson random measures with convolution kernel given in terms of the scale function. Also, we obtain several equivalent stochastic equations by using the potential theoretic techniques and prove the strong existence and uniqueness by using the generalized Yamada-Watanabe theorems.
  Armed with the stochastic Volterra representation, we then establish a comparison principle for the local times of spectrally positive L\'evy processes with various drifts or stopped when local times at zero exceed different given values, which proposes a stochastic flow enjoying the branching property. And also, we explore some novel properties of local times in the spatial direction including uniform moment estimates, $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-H\"older continuity and maximal inequality. By using the method of duality, we provide an exponential-affine representation of the Laplace functional in terms of the unique non-negative solution of a path-dependent nonlinear Volterra equation associated with the Laplace exponent of L\'evy process. This gives another perspective on the evolution dynamics of local times in the spatial direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal limit theorem is a central result in rough path theory, which has been proved for: (i) rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$; (ii) geometric rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$; (iii) branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths are natural generalizations of both rough paths and branched rough paths, in the sense that post-Lie algebras are generalizations of both Lie algebras and pre-Lie algebras. Here the primitive elements of the graded dual Hopf algebra of the Hopf algebra corresponding to the planarly branched rough paths (resp. rough paths, resp. branched rough paths) form a post-Lie (resp. Lie, resp. pre-Lie algebra). In this paper, we prove the universal limit theorem for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$, via the method of Banach fixed point theorem.</description>

These indices are highly variable over time and include sub-exponential memory, where the influences of past events persist over long durations. Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the former affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly studied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to address. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic asset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model was originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its mathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation: river discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices. Moreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical description of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the model are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic volatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water quantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from a river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory and the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge. This approach, grounded in infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, represents a novel contribution to the modelling and analysis of environmental systems where long memory processes play a role.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the framework of quadratic-form optimal transport (QOT), whose transport cost has the form $\iint c\,\mathrm{d}\pi \otimes\mathrm{d}\pi$ for some coupling $\pi$ between two marginals. Interesting examples of quadratic-form transport cost and their optimization include inequality measurement, the variance of a bivariate function, covariance, Kendall's tau, the Gromov--Wasserstein distance, quadratic assignment problems, and quadratic regularization of classic optimal transport. QOT leads to substantially different mathematical structures compared to classic transport problems and many technical challenges. We illustrate the fundamental properties of QOT and provide several cases where explicit solutions are obtained. For a wide class of cost functions, including the rectangular cost functions, the QOT problem is solved by a new coupling called the diamond transport, whose copula is supported on a diamond in the unit square.</description>

      <title>Vlasov Equations on Directed Hypergraph Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to investigate the mean field limit (MFL) of interacting particle systems on directed hypergraphs. We provide a non-trivial measure-theoretic viewpoint and make extensions of directed hypergraphs as directed hypergraph measures (DHGMs), which are measure-valued functions on a compact metric space. These DHGMs can be regarded as hypergraph limits which include limits of a sequence of hypergraphs that are sparse, dense, or of intermediate densities. Our main results show that the Vlasov equation on DHGMs are well-posed and its solution can be approximated by empirical distributions of large networks of higher-order interactions. The results are applied to a Kuramoto network in physics, an epidemic network, and an ecological network, all of which include higher-order interactions. To prove the main results on the approximation and well-posedness of the Vlasov equation on DHGMs, we robustly generalize the method of [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349] to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Risk Aversion and Insurance Propensity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new foundation of risk aversion by showing that this attitude is fully captured by the propensity to seize insurance opportunities. Our foundation, which applies to all probabilistically sophisticated preferences, well accords with the commonly held prudential interpretation of risk aversion that dates back to the seminal works of Arrow (1963) and Pratt (1964). In our main results, we first characterize the Arrow-Pratt risk aversion in terms of propensity to full insurance and the stronger notion of risk aversion of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) in terms of propensity to partial insurance. We then extend the analysis to comparative risk aversion by showing that the notion of Yaari (1969) corresponds to comparative propensity to full insurance, while the stronger notion of Ross (1981) corresponds to comparative propensity to partial insurance.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Convergence Guarantees for a General Class of Score-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) is a recent class of deep generative models with state-of-the-art performance in many applications. In this paper, we establish convergence guarantees for a general class of SGMs in 2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth log-concave data distribution. We specialize our result to several concrete SGMs with specific choices of forward processes modelled by stochastic differential equations, and obtain an upper bound on the iteration complexity for each model, which demonstrates the impacts of different choices of the forward processes. We also provide a lower bound when the data distribution is Gaussian. Numerically, we experiment SGMs with different forward processes, some of which are newly proposed in this paper, for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10. We find that the experimental results are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions on the iteration complexity, and the models with our newly proposed forward processes can outperform existing models.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions avoiding any Lipschitzness assumption on the score function. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Rank of the Odd Normal Out</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A century ago Thurstone wrote about using $\mathbf{X}\sim\mathcal{N}_{n}\left(\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\right)$ to model our preferences (1927a,b,c). Today latent normals frequently model random rankings. Despite this, for $R_{i}:=\#\left\{ 1\leq j\leq n:X_{j}\leq X_{i}\right\} $, little is known about $\left(R_{i_{0}},\ldots,R_{i_{m}}\right)$'s distribution in non-i.i.d. settings. We consider the simplest of such settings, namely that with $n+1$ independent normals, where $X_{0}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mu_{0},\sigma_{0}^{2}\right)$ and $X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\sigma^{2}\right)$. In this setting $\left(\left.R_{0}\right|X_{0}\right)\sim1+\mathrm{Binomial}\left(n,\Phi\left(\left(X_{0}-\mu\right)/\sigma\right)\right)$, and $\Phi\left(\left(X_{0}-\mu\right)/\sigma\right)$ is approximately beta-distributed. The beta distribution's conjugacy for the binomial implies that $R_{0}-1$ is roughly beta-binomial. We approximate the distribution of $\left(R_{i_{0}},\ldots,R_{i_{m}}\right)$, deriving $\mathbb{E}R_{i}$, $\mathrm{Var}\left(R_{i}\right)$, $\mathrm{Cov}\left(R_{i},R_{j}\right)$, and its limiting distributions as key parameters grow large or small.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for General Probability Flow ODEs of Diffusion Models in Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative modeling with probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has achieved remarkable success in a variety of applications. While various fast ODE-based samplers have been proposed in the literature and employed in practice, the theoretical understandings about convergence properties of the probability flow ODE are still quite limited. In this paper, we provide the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for a general class of probability flow ODE samplers in 2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth log-concave data distributions. We then consider various examples and establish results on the iteration complexity of the corresponding ODE-based samplers. Our proof technique relies on spelling out explicitly the contraction rate for the continuous-time ODE and analyzing the discretization and score-matching errors using synchronous coupling; the challenge in our analysis mainly arises from the inherent non-autonomy of the probability flow ODE and the specific exponential integrator that we study.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</description>

      <title>MCGAN: Enhancing GAN Training with Regression-Based Generator Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-fidelity data. However, the main bottleneck of existing approaches is the lack of supervision on the generator training, which often results in undamped oscillation and unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Monte Carlo GAN (MCGAN). This approach, utilizing an innovative generative loss function, termly the regression loss, reformulates the generator training as a regression task and enables the generator training by minimizing the mean squared error between the discriminator's output of real data and the expected discriminator of fake data. We demonstrate the desirable analytic properties of the regression loss, including discriminability and optimality, and show that our method requires a weaker condition on the discriminator for effective generator training. These properties justify the strength of this approach to improve the training stability while retaining the optimality of GAN by leveraging strong supervision of the regression loss. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including image data (CIFAR-10/100, FFHQ256, ImageNet, and LSUN Bedroom), time series data (VAR and stock data) and video data, are conducted to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our proposed MCGAN. Numerical results show that the proposed MCGAN is versatile in enhancing a variety of backbone GAN models and achieves consistent and significant improvement in terms of quality, accuracy, training stability, and learned latent space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem and to uniform-in-time concentration estimates for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel $Q$-learning algorithm allowing to solve distributionally robust Markov decision problems for which the ambiguity set of probability measures can be chosen arbitrarily as long as it comprises only a finite amount of measures. Therefore, our approach goes beyond the well-studied cases involving ambiguity sets of balls around some reference measure with the distance to reference measure being measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance or the Kullback--Leibler divergence. Hence, our approach allows the applicant to create ambiguity sets better tailored to her needs and to solve the associated robust Markov decision problem via a $Q$-learning algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed by our main result. Moreover, we showcase in several numerical experiments the tractability of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with $3$-D stochastic Euler-Poisson equations with insulating boundary conditions forced by the Wiener process. We first establish the global existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system, then we prove that the solution converges to its steady-state time-asymptotically. To obtain the converging rate, we need to develop weighted energy estimates, which are not required for the deterministic counterpart of the problem. Moreover, we observe that the invariant measure is just the Dirac measure generated by the steady-state, in which the time-exponential convergence rate to the steady-state plays an essential role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a continuous-time phase-type distribution, starting with its Laplace-Stieltjes transform, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for its minimal phase-type representation to have the same order as the algebraic degree of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform. To facilitate finding this minimal representation, we transform this condition equivalently into a quadratic nonconvex optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed using an alternating minimization algorithm. The algorithm convergence is also proved. Moreover, the method we develop for the continuous-time phase-type distributions can be directly used to the discrete-time phase-type distributions after establishing an equivalence between the minimal representation problems for continuous-time and discrete-times phase-type distributions.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to global minimizers in data driven supervised deep learning: Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization provably fail to converge to global minimizers in the training of deep neural networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods - consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays key tools to solve data driven supervised learning problems. Despite the great success of SGD methods in the training of DNNs, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to explain the success and the limitations of such methods in rigorous theoretical terms. In particular, even in the standard setup of data driven supervised learning problems, it remained an open research problem to prove (or disprove) that SGD methods converge in the training of DNNs with the popular rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with high probability to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. In this work we answer this question negatively. Specifically, in this work we prove for a large class of SGD methods that the considered optimizer does with high probability not converge to global minimizers of the optimization problem. It turns out that the probability to not converge to a global minimizer converges at least exponentially quickly to one as the width of the first hidden layer of the ANN and the depth of the ANN, respectively, increase. The general non-convergence results of this work do not only apply to the plain vanilla standard SGD method but also to a large class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods such as the momentum SGD, the Nesterov accelerated SGD, the Adagrad, the RMSProp, the Adam, the Adamax, the AMSGrad, and the Nadam optimizers.</description>

      <title>Gaussian multi-target filtering with target dynamics driven by a stochastic differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Tits alternative for circle diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu_1, \mu_2$ be probability measures on $\mathrm{Diff}^1_+(S^1)$ satisfying a suitable moment condition and such that their supports genererate discrete groups acting proximally on $S^1$. Let $(f^n_\omega)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}, (f^n_{\omega'})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be two independent realizations of the random walk driven by $\mu_1, \mu_2$ respectively. We show that almost surely there is an $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n \geq N$ the elements $f^n_\omega, f^n_{\omega'}$ generate a nonabelian free group. The proof is inspired by the strategy by R. Aoun for linear groups and uses work of A. Gorodetski, V. Kleptsyn and G. Monakov, and of P. Barrientos and D. Malicet. A weaker (and easier) statement holds for measures supported on $\mathrm{Homeo}_+(S^1)$ with no moment conditions.</description>

      <title>A New Proof for the Linear Filtering and Smoothing Equations, and Asymptotic Expansion of Nonlinear Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.</description>

      <title>Critical values for Intermediate and Box dimension of projections and other images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ we investigate for which values of $m$ we have that $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=m$ or $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=\dim_\theta E$ for $\gamma_{d,m}-$almost all $V\in G(d,m)$. Our result can be extended to more general functions that include orthogonal projections and fractional Brownian motion. As a particular case, letting $\theta=1$, the results are valid for the Box dimension.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of (nonlinear) rough continuity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to fluid dynamics, we study rough differential equations (RDEs) and rough partial differential equations (RPDEs) with non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove well-posedness and existence of a flow for RDEs with Osgood drifts, as well as well-posedness of weak $L^p$-valued solutions to linear rough continuity and transport equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ under DiPerna--Lions regularity conditions; a combination of the two then yields flow representation formula for linear RPDEs. We apply these results to obtain existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence for $L^1\cap L^\infty$-valued solutions to a general class of nonlinear continuity equations. In particular, our framework covers the $2$D Euler equations in vorticity form with rough transport noise, providing a rough analogue of Yudovich's theorem. As a consequence, we construct an associated continuous random dynamical system, when the driving noise is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (1/3,1)$. We further prove weak existence of solutions for initial vorticities in $L^1\cap L^p$, for any $p\in [1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>

      <title>Trend-encoded Probabilistic Multi-order Model: A Non-Machine Learning Approach for Enhanced Stock Market Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the dominance of machine learning in stock market forecasting has been evident. While these models have shown decreasing prediction errors, their robustness across different datasets has been a concern. A successful stock market prediction model minimizes prediction errors and showcases robustness across various data sets, indicating superior forecasting performance. This study introduces a novel multiple lag order probabilistic model based on trend encoding (TeMoP) that enhances stock market predictions through a probabilistic approach. Results across different stock indexes from nine countries demonstrate that the TeMoP outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning models in predicting accuracy and stabilization.</description>
