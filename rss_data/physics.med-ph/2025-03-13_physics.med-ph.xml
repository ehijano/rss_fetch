      <title>Diffusing Alpha-emitters Radiation Therapy: In vivo Measurements of Effective Diffusion and Clearance Rates Across Multiple Tumor Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy (Alpha-DaRT) is a new modality that uses alpha particles to treat solid tumors. Alpha-DaRT employs interstitial sources loaded with low activities of Radium-224, which release a chain of short-lived alpha-emitters diffusing over a few millimeters around each source. Alpha-DaRT dosimetry is described, to first order, by a framework called the diffusion-leakage (DL) model. The aim of this work is to estimate the tumor-specific parameters of the DL model from in-vivo studies on multiple histological cancer types. Autoradiography studies with phosphor imaging were conducted on 113 mice-borne tumors from 10 cancer cell lines. An observable, referred to as the effective diffusion length, Leff, was extracted from images of histological slices obtained using phosphor screens. The tumor and Alpha-DaRT source activities were measured after excision with a gamma counter to estimate the probability of Lead-212 clearance from the tumor by the blood, Pleak(Pb). The measured values of Leff are in the range of 0.2-0.7 mm across different tumor types and sizes. Pleak(Pb) is between 10% and 90% for all measured tumors, and it generally decreases in magnitude and spread for larger tumors. The measured values of Leff and Pleak(Pb) and associated dose calculations indicate that hexagonal Alpha-DaRT source lattices of ~4 mm spacing with muCi-scale Radium-224 activities can lead to effective coverage of the tumor volume with therapeutic dose levels, with considerable margin to compensate for local variations in diffusion and leakage.</description>

      <title>Pulsed laser diode excitation for transcranial photoacoustic imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic (PA) imaging of deep tissue tends to employ Q-switched lasers with high pulse energy to generate high optical fluence and therefore high PA signal. Compared to Q-switched lasers, pulsed laser diodes (PLDs) typically generate low pulse energy. In PA imaging applications with strong acoustic attenuation, such as through human skull bone, the broadband PA waves generated by nanoseconds laser pulses are significantly reduced in bandwidth during their propagation to a detector. As high-frequency PA signal components are not transmitted through skull, we propose to not generate them by increasing excitation pulse duration. Because PLDs are mainly limited in their peak power output, an increase in pulse duration linearly increases pulse energy and therefore PA signal amplitude. Here we show that the optimal pulse duration for deep PA sensing through thick skull bone is far higher than in typical PA applications. Counterintuitively, this makes PLD excitation well-suited for transcranial photoacoustics. We show this in PA sensing experiments on ex vivo human skull bone.</description>
