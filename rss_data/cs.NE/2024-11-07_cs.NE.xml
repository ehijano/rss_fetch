      <title>A Surrogate Model for Quay Crane Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ports, a variety of tasks are carried out, and scheduling these tasks is crucial due to its significant impact on productivity, making the generation of precise plans essential. This study proposes a method to solve the Quay Crane Scheduling Problem (QCSP), a representative task scheduling problem in ports known to be NP-Hard, more quickly and accurately. First, the study suggests a method to create more accurate work plans for Quay Cranes (QCs) by learning from actual port data to accurately predict the working speed of QCs. Next, a Surrogate Model is proposed by combining a Machine Learning (ML) model with a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is widely used to solve complex optimization problems, enabling faster and more precise exploration of solutions. Unlike methods that use fixed-dimensional chromosome encoding, the proposed methodology can provide solutions for encodings of various dimensions. To validate the performance of the newly proposed methodology, comparative experiments were conducted, demonstrating faster search speeds and improved fitness scores. The method proposed in this study can be applied not only to QCSP but also to various NP-Hard problems, and it opens up possibilities for the further development of advanced search algorithms by combining heuristic algorithms with ML models.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Study on Decomposition-Based Deep Ensemble Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in intelligent transport systems. Deep learning offers an effective solution, capturing complex patterns in time-series traffic flow data to enable the accurate prediction. However, deep learning models are prone to overfitting the intricate details of flow data, leading to poor generalisation. Recent studies suggest that decomposition-based deep ensemble learning methods may address this issue by breaking down a time series into multiple simpler signals, upon which deep learning models are built and ensembled to generate the final prediction. However, few studies have compared the performance of decomposition-based ensemble methods with non-decomposition-based ones which directly utilise raw time-series data. This work compares several decomposition-based and non-decomposition-based deep ensemble learning methods. Experimental results on three traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of decomposition-based ensemble methods, while also revealing their sensitivity to aggregation strategies and forecasting horizons.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Difference Learning Using Distributed Error Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computational problem in biological reward-based learning is how credit assignment is performed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Much research suggests that NAc dopamine encodes temporal-difference (TD) errors for learning value predictions. However, dopamine is synchronously distributed in regionally homogeneous concentrations, which does not support explicit credit assignment (like used by backpropagation). It is unclear whether distributed errors alone are sufficient for synapses to make coordinated updates to learn complex, nonlinear reward-based learning tasks. We design a new deep Q-learning algorithm, Artificial Dopamine, to computationally demonstrate that synchronously distributed, per-layer TD errors may be sufficient to learn surprisingly complex RL tasks. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on MinAtar, the DeepMind Control Suite, and classic control tasks, and show it often achieves comparable performance to deep RL algorithms that use backpropagation.</description>

      <title>PropNEAT -- Efficient GPU-Compatible Backpropagation over NeuroEvolutionary Augmenting Topology Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PropNEAT, a fast backpropagation implementation of NEAT that uses a bidirectional mapping of the genome graph to a layer-based architecture that preserves the NEAT genomes whilst enabling efficient GPU backpropagation. We test PropNEAT on 58 binary classification datasets from the Penn Machine Learning Benchmarks database, comparing the performance against logistic regression, dense neural networks and random forests, as well as a densely retrained variant of the final PropNEAT model. PropNEAT had the second best overall performance, behind Random Forest, though the difference between the models was not statistically significant apart from between Random Forest in comparison with logistic regression and the PropNEAT retrain models. PropNEAT was substantially faster than a naive backpropagation method, and both were substantially faster and had better performance than the original NEAT implementation. We demonstrate that the per-epoch training time for PropNEAT scales linearly with network depth, and is efficient on GPU implementations for backpropagation. This implementation could be extended to support reinforcement learning or convolutional networks, and is able to find sparser and smaller networks with potential for applications in low-power contexts.</description>

      <title>Long-Form Text-to-Music Generation with Adaptive Prompts: A Case of Study in Tabletop Role-Playing Games Soundtracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities of text-to-audio music generation models in producing long-form music with prompts that change over time, focusing on soundtrack generation for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs). We introduce Babel Bardo, a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform speech transcriptions into music descriptions for controlling a text-to-music model. Four versions of Babel Bardo were compared in two TRPG campaigns: a baseline using direct speech transcriptions, and three LLM-based versions with varying approaches to music description generation. Evaluations considered audio quality, story alignment, and transition smoothness. Results indicate that detailed music descriptions improve audio quality while maintaining consistency across consecutive descriptions enhances story alignment and transition smoothness.</description>

      <title>Scalable Network Emulation on Analog Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel software feature for the BrainScaleS-2 accelerated neuromorphic platform that facilitates the partitioned emulation of large-scale spiking neural networks. This approach is well suited for deep spiking neural networks and allows for sequential model emulation on undersized neuromorphic resources if the largest recurrent subnetwork and the required neuron fan-in fit on the substrate. The ability to emulate and train networks larger than the substrate provides a pathway for accurate performance evaluation in planned or scaled systems, ultimately advancing the development and understanding of large-scale models and neuromorphic computing architectures. We demonstrate the training of two deep spiking neural network models -- using the MNIST and EuroSAT datasets -- that exceed the physical size constraints of a single-chip BrainScaleS-2 system.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation Framework for Evolutionary Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization problems are characterized by an interactive hierarchical structure, where the upper level seeks to optimize its strategy while simultaneously considering the response of the lower level. Evolutionary algorithms are commonly used to solve complex bilevel problems in practical scenarios, but they face significant resource consumption challenges due to the nested structure imposed by the implicit lower-level optimality condition. This challenge becomes even more pronounced as problem dimensions increase. Although recent methods have enhanced bilevel convergence through task-level knowledge sharing, further efficiency improvements are still hindered by redundant lower-level iterations that consume excessive resources while generating unpromising solutions. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient dynamic resource allocation framework for evolutionary bilevel optimization, named DRC-BLEA. Compared to existing approaches, DRC-BLEA introduces a novel competitive quasi-parallel paradigm, in which multiple lower-level optimization tasks, derived from different upper-level individuals, compete for resources. A continuously updated selection probability is used to prioritize execution opportunities to promising tasks. Additionally, a cooperation mechanism is integrated within the competitive framework to further enhance efficiency and prevent premature convergence. Experimental results compared with chosen state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, DRC-BLEA achieves competitive accuracy across diverse problem sets and real-world scenarios, while significantly reducing the number of function evaluations and overall running time.</description>

      <title>Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.</description>

      <title>Generalized Dynamic Brain Functional Connectivity Based on Random Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis has been widely applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to reveal time-varying dynamic changes of brain states. The sliding window method is by far the most popular DFC analysis method due to its simplicity. However, the sliding window method comes with some assumptions, namely the typically approach uses a single window which captures dynamics only within a specific frequency range. In this study, we propose a generalized approach to dynamics via a multi-dimensional random convolution (RandCon) DFC method that is able to effectively capture time-varying DFC at arbitrary time scales by extracting different local features from fMRI time series using a number of multi-dimensional random convolution kernels without the need for learning kernel weights. Compared to a standard sliding window method, multiplication of temporal derivatives (MTD) and phase synchrony methods, RandCon with the smallest kernel size (3 time points) showed notable improvements in performance on simulated data, particularly in terms of DFC temporal and spatial estimation in very short window/kernel size under different noise levels. Results from real fMRI data indicated that RandCon was more sensitive to gender differences than competing methods. Furthermore, we show that the sliding window method can be considered a special case of the proposed multi-dimensional convolution framework. The proposed method is simple and efficient significantly broadens the scope of dynamic functional connectivity research and offer theoretical and practical potential.</description>
