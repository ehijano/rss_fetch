      <title>Trans-Bifurcation Prediction of Dynamics in terms of Extreme Learning Machines with Control Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By extending the extreme learning machine by additional control inputs, we achieved almost complete reproduction of bifurcation structures of dynamical systems. The learning ability of the proposed neural network system is striking in that the entire structure of the bifurcations of a target one-parameter family of dynamical systems can be nearly reproduced by training on transient dynamics using only a few parameter values. Moreover, we propose a mechanism to explain this remarkable learning ability and discuss the relationship between the present results and similar results obtained by Kim et al.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomial approximation and Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition in chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08074v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) is a data-driven tool for forecasting and model reduction of dynamics, which has been extensively taken up in the physical sciences. While the method is conceptually simple, in deterministic chaos it is unclear what its properties are or even what it converges to. In particular, it is not clear how EDMD's least-squares approximation treats the classes of differentiable functions on which chaotic systems act.
  We develop for the first time a general, rigorous theory of EDMD on the simplest examples of chaotic maps: analytic expanding maps of the circle. To do this, we prove a new, basic approximation result in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC) and apply methods from transfer operator theory. We show that in the infinite-data limit, the least-squares projection error is exponentially small for trigonometric polynomial observable dictionaries. As a result, we show that forecasts and Koopman spectral data produced using EDMD in this setting converge to the physically meaningful limits, exponentially fast with respect to the size of the dictionary. This demonstrates that with only a relatively small polynomial dictionary, EDMD can be very effective, even when the sampling measure is not uniform. Furthermore, our OPUC result suggests that data-based least-squares projection may be a very effective approximation strategy more generally.</description>

      <title>Interference of resonances in two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15017v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-proton ($2p$) emission from $^{16}$Ne with the time-dependent $^{14}$O$+p+p$ three-body calculations. Two $0^+$ resonances are suggested to participate. For the $0^+_1$ resonance, the true emission of the spatially localized two protons is dominant, if the single-particle $s_{1/2}$ resonance locates above the $2p$ energy. By evaluating a time-evolution probability, the $0^+_2$ resonance is suggested at $\cong 3$ MeV from the $2p$ threshold. The inclusion of $0^+_2$ resonance makes the true-$2p$~emission more dominant in the time-dependent calculations.</description>
