      <title>OpenAlpha: A Community-Led Adversarial Strategy Validation Mechanism for Decentralised Capital Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose \textit{OpenAlpha}, a community-led strategy validation framework for decentralised capital management on a host blockchain network, which integrates game-theoretic validation, adversarial auditing, and market-based belief aggregation. This work formulates treasury deployment as a capital optimisation problem under verification costs and strategic misreporting, and operationalises it through a decision waterfall that sequences intention declaration, strategy proposal, prediction-market validation, dispute resolution, and capital allocation. Each phase of this framework's validation process embeds economic incentives to align proposer, verifier, and auditor behaviour, producing confidence scores that may feed into a capital allocation rule. While OpenAlpha is designed for capital strategy assessment, its validation mechanisms are composable and extend naturally to evaluating external decentralised applications (DApps), enabling on-chain scrutiny of DApp performance, reliability, and integration risk. This architecture allows for adaptive, trust-minimised capital deployment without reliance on centralised governance or static audits.</description>

      <title>On the hidden costs of passive investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive investing has gained immense popularity due to its low fees and the perceived simplicity of focusing on zero tracking error, rather than security selection. However, our analysis shows that the passive (zero tracking error) approach of waiting until the market close on the day of index reconstitution to purchase a stock (that was announced days earlier as an upcoming addition) results in costs amounting to hundreds of basis points compared to strategies that involve gradually acquiring a small portion of the required shares in advance with minimal additional tracking errors. In addition, we show that under all scenarios analyzed, a trader who builds a small inventory post-announcement and provides liquidity at the reconstitution event can consistently earn several hundreds of basis points in profit and often much more, assuming minimal risk.</description>
