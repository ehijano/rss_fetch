      <title>A Class of Hierarchical Sliding Mode Control based on Extended Kalman filter for Quadrotor UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel methodology for controlling Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, focusing on Hierarchical Sliding Mode Control strategies and an Extended Kalman Filter. Initially, an EKF is proposed to enhance robustness in estimating UAV states, thereby reducing the impact of measured noises and external disturbances. By locally linearizing UAV systems, the EKF can mitigate the disadvantages of the Kalman filter and reduce the computational cost of other nonlinear observers. Subsequently, in comparison to other related work in terms of stability and computational cost, the HSMC framework shows its outperformance in allowing the quadrotor UAVs to track the references. Three types of HSMC Aggregated HSMC, Incremental HSMC, and Combining HSMC are investigated for their effectiveness in tracking reference trajectories. Moreover, the stability of the quadrotor UAVs is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov stability principle. Finally, experimental results and comparative analyses demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed methodologies.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Constrained Vector Field for Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector fields are advantageous in handling nonholonomic motion planning as they provide reference orientation for robots. However, additionally incorporating curvature constraints becomes challenging, due to the interconnection between the design of the curvature-bounded vector field and the tracking controller under underactuation. In this paper, we present a novel framework to co-develop the vector field and the control laws, guiding the nonholonomic robot to the target configuration with curvature-bounded trajectory. First, we formulate the problem by introducing the target positive limit set, which allows the robot to converge to or pass through the target configuration, depending on different dynamics and tasks. Next, we construct a curvature-constrained vector field (CVF) via blending and distributing basic flow fields in workspace and propose the saturated control laws with a dynamic gain, under which the tracking error's magnitude decreases even when saturation occurs. Under the control laws, kinematically constrained nonholonomic robots are guaranteed to track the reference CVF and converge to the target positive limit set with bounded trajectory curvature. Numerical simulations show that the proposed CVF method outperforms other vector-field-based algorithms. Experiments on Ackermann UGVs and semi-physical fixed-wing UAVs demonstrate that the method can be effectively implemented in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Multi-Element Collaborative Research and Application for Modern Power System Based on Generative Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to intelligent, low-carbon power systems necessitates advanced optimization strategies for managing renewable energy integration, energy storage, and carbon emissions. Generative Large Models (GLMs) provide a data-driven approach to enhancing forecasting, scheduling, and market operations by processing multi-source data and capturing complex system dynamics. This paper explores the role of GLMs in optimizing load-side management, energy storage utilization, and electricity carbon, with a focus on Smart Wide-area Hybrid Energy Systems with Storage and Carbon (SGLSC). By leveraging spatiotemporal modeling and reinforcement learning, GLMs enable dynamic energy scheduling, improve grid stability, enhance carbon trading strategies, and strengthen resilience against extreme weather events. The proposed framework highlights the transformative potential of GLMs in achieving efficient, adaptive, and low-carbon power system operations.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Resilience in Power Systems: Adversarial Deep Learning for Robust Short-Term Voltage Stability Assessment under Cyber-Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 4.0, ensuring the resilience of cyber-physical systems against sophisticated cyber threats is increasingly critical. This study proposes a pioneering AI-based control framework that enhances short-term voltage stability assessments (STVSA) in power systems under complex composite cyber-attacks. First, by incorporating white-box and black-box adversarial attacks with Denial-of-Service (DoS) perturbations during training, composite adversarial attacks are implemented. Second, the application of Spectral Normalized Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (SNCWGAN-GP) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) strengthens the model's resistance to adversarial disturbances, improving data quality and training stability. Third, an assessment model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-enhanced Graph Attention Network (L-GAT) is developed to capture dynamic relationships between the post-fault dynamic trajectories and electrical grid topology. Experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed method in composite cyber-attack scenarios. This contribution is pivotal to advancing AI-based resilient control strategies for nonlinear dynamical systems, marking a substantial enhancement in the security of cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Simulation Model of the Pyro-Process in Cement Clinker Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a dynamic simulation model for the pyro-process of clinker production in cement plants. The study aims to construct a simulation model capable of replicating the real-world dynamics of the pyro-process to facilitate research into the improvements of operation, i.e., the development of alternative strategies for reducing CO2 emissions and ensuring clinker quality, production, and lowering fuel consumption. The presented model is an index-1 differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model based on first engineering principles and modular approaches. Using a systematic approach, the model is described on a detailed level that integrates geometric aspects, thermo-physical properties, transport phenomena, stoichiometry and kinetics, mass and energy balances, and algebraic volume and energy conservations. By manually calibrating the model to a steady-state reference, we provide dynamic simulation results that match the expected reference performance and the expected dynamic behavior from the industrial practices.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents, behave differently in the real-world. We would like to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. Thus, we propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address these challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance (in terms of an f-divergence) between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Route Recommendations for Traffic Management Under Learned Partial Driver Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to mitigate congestion in traffic management systems by guiding travelers along system-optimal (SO) routes. However, we recognize that most theoretical approaches assume perfect driver compliance, which often does not reflect reality, as drivers tend to deviate from recommendations to fulfill their personal objectives. Therefore, we propose a route recommendation framework that explicitly learns partial driver compliance and optimizes traffic flow under realistic adherence. We first compute an SO edge flow through flow optimization techniques. Next, we train a compliance model based on historical driver decisions to capture individual responses to our recommendations. Finally, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem that minimizes the gap between the target SO flow and the realized flow under conditions of imperfect adherence. Our simulations conducted on a grid network reveal that our approach significantly reduces travel time compared to baseline strategies, demonstrating the practical advantage of incorporating learned compliance into traffic management.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems without the I.I.D. Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates online identification and prediction for nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. In contrast to offline learning methods, we develop online algorithms that learn unknown parameters from a single trajectory. A key challenge in this setting is handling the non-independent data generated by the closed-loop system. Existing theoretical guarantees for such systems are mostly restricted to the assumption that inputs are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.), or that the closed-loop data satisfy a persistent excitation (PE) condition. However, these assumptions are often violated in applications such as adaptive feedback control. In this paper, we propose an online projected Newton-type algorithm for parameter estimation in nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems, and develop an online predictor for system outputs based on online parameter estimates. By using both the stochastic Lyapunov function and martingale estimation methods, we demonstrate that the average regret converges to zero without requiring traditional persistent excitation (PE) conditions. Furthermore, we establish a novel excitation condition that ensures global convergence of the online parameter estimates. The proposed excitation condition is applicable to a broader class of system trajectories, including those violating the PE condition.</description>

      <title>Moving Target Defense Against Adversarial False Data Injection Attacks In Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based detectors have been shown to be effective in detecting stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that can bypass conventional bad data detectors (BDDs) in power systems. However, ML models are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. A sophisticated perturbation signal added to the original BDD-bypassing FDIA can conceal the attack from ML-based detectors. In this paper, we develop a moving target defense (MTD) strategy to defend against adversarial FDIAs in power grids. We first develop an MTD-strengthened deep neural network (DNN) model, which deploys a pool of DNN models rather than a single static model that cooperate to detect the adversarial attack jointly. The MTD model pool introduces randomness to the ML model's decision boundary, thereby making the adversarial attacks detectable. Furthermore, to increase the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and reduce the computational costs associated with developing the MTD model pool, we combine this approach with the physics-based MTD, which involves dynamically perturbing the transmission line reactance and retraining the DNN-based detector to adapt to the new system topology. Simulations conducted on IEEE test bus systems demonstrate that the MTD-strengthened DNN achieves up to 94.2% accuracy in detecting adversarial FDIAs. When combined with a physics-based MTD, the detection accuracy surpasses 99%, while significantly reducing the computational costs of updating the DNN models. This approach requires only moderate perturbations to transmission line reactances, resulting in minimal increases in OPF cost.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Associative Memory with Exponential Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slowing of Moore's law and the increasing energy demands of machine learning present critical challenges for both the hardware and machine learning communities, and drive the development of novel computing paradigms. Of particular interest is the challenge of incorporating memory efficiently into the learning process. Inspired by how human brains store and retrieve information, associative memory mechanisms provide a class of computational methods that can store and retrieve patterns in a robust, energy-efficient manner. Existing associative memory architectures, such as the celebrated Hopfield model and oscillatory associative memory networks, store patterns as stable equilibria of network dynamics. However, the capacity (i.e. the number of patterns that a network can memorize normalized by their number of nodes) of existing oscillatory models have been shown to decrease with the size of the network, making them impractical for large-scale, real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel associative memory architecture based on Kuramoto oscillators. We show that the capacity of our associative memory network increases exponentially with network size and features no spurious memories. In addition, we present algorithms and numerical experiments to support these theoretical findings, providing guidelines for the hardware implementation of the proposed associative memory networks.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resilience-Aware Control in Multi-Robot Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring resilient consensus in multi-robot systems with misbehaving agents remains a challenge, as many existing network resilience properties are inherently combinatorial and globally defined. While previous works have proposed control laws to enhance or preserve resilience in multi-robot networks, they often assume a fixed topology with known resilience properties, or require global state knowledge. These assumptions may be impractical in physically-constrained environments, where safety and resilience requirements are conflicting, or when misbehaving agents corrupt the shared information. In this work, we propose a distributed control law that enables each robot to guarantee resilient consensus and safety during its navigation without fixed topologies using only locally available information. To this end, we establish a new sufficient condition for resilient consensus in time-varying networks based on the degree of non-misbehaving or normal agents. Using this condition, we design a Control Barrier Function (CBF)-based controller that guarantees resilient consensus and collision avoidance without requiring estimates of global state and/or control actions of all other robots. Finally, we validate our method through simulations.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Cable-Suspended Payload Transportation with Multi-Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), particularly quadrotors, have shown significant potential in assisting humans with tasks such as construction and package delivery. These applications benefit greatly from the use of cables for manipulation mechanisms due to their lightweight, low-cost, and simple design. However, designing effective control and planning strategies for cable-suspended systems presents several challenges, including indirect load actuation, nonlinear configuration space, and highly coupled system dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel event-triggered distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) method specifically designed for cooperative transportation involving multiple quadrotors manipulating a cable-suspended payload. This approach addresses key challenges such as payload manipulation, inter-robot separation, obstacle avoidance, and trajectory tracking, all while optimizing the use of computational and communication resources. By integrating an event-triggered mechanism, our NMPC method reduces unnecessary computations and communication, enhancing energy efficiency and extending the operational range of MAVs. The proposed method employs a lightweight state vector parametrization that focuses on payload states in all six degrees of freedom, enabling efficient planning of trajectories on the SE(3) manifold. This not only reduces planning complexity but also ensures real-time computational feasibility. Our approach is validated through extensive simulation, demonstrating its efficacy in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Distributed Linear Quadratic Gaussian for Multi-Robot Coordination with Localization Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of event-based distributed Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control for multirobot coordination under localization uncertainty. An event-triggered LQG rendezvous control strategy is proposed to ensure coordinated motion while reducing communication overhead. The design framework decouples the LQG controller from the event-triggering mechanism, although the scheduler parameters critically influence rendezvous performance. We establish stochastic stability for the closed-loop multi-robot system and demonstrate that a carefully tuned event-triggering scheduler can effectively balance rendezvous accuracy with communication efficiency by limiting the upper bound of the rendezvous error while minimizing the average transmission rate. Experimental results using a group of Robotarium mobile robots validate the proposed approach, confirming its efficacy in achieving robust coordination under uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of distributed coordination control for multi-robot systems (MRSs) in the presence of localization uncertainty using a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) approach. We introduce a stochastic LQG control strategy that ensures the coordination of mobile robots while optimizing a performance criterion. The proposed control framework accounts for the inherent uncertainty in localization measurements, enabling robust decision-making and coordination. We analyze the stability of the system under the proposed control protocol, deriving conditions for the convergence of the multi-robot network. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experimental validation using Robotrium simulation experiments, showcasing the practical applicability of the control strategy in real-world scenarios with localization uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries For Fast Frequency Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%-57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description>

      <title>Taming High-Dimensional Dynamics: Learning Optimal Projections onto Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional nonlinear systems pose considerable challenges for modeling and control across many domains, from fluid mechanics to advanced robotics. Such systems are typically approximated with reduced order models, which often rely on orthogonal projections, a simplification that may lead to large prediction errors. In this work, we derive optimality of fiber-aligned projections onto spectral submanifolds, preserving the nonlinear geometric structure and minimizing long-term prediction error. We propose a computationally tractable procedure to approximate these projections from data, and show how the effect of control can be incorporated. For a 180-dimensional robotic system, we demonstrate that our reduced-order models outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches by up to fivefold in trajectory tracking accuracy under model predictive control.</description>

      <title>A Robust Method for Fault Detection and Severity Estimation in Mechanical Vibration Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a robust method for fault detection and severity estimation in multivariate time-series data to enhance predictive maintenance of mechanical systems. We use the Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies among variables. This enables accurate future state predictions under varying operational conditions. To address the challenge of fluctuating anomaly scores that reduce fault severity estimation accuracy, we introduce a novel fault severity index based on the mean and standard deviation of anomaly scores. This generates a continuous and reliable severity measurement. We validate the proposed method using two experimental datasets: an open IMS bearing dataset and data collected from a fanjet electric propulsion system. Results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces abrupt fluctuations and inconsistencies in anomaly scores. This provides a more dependable foundation for maintenance planning and risk management in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Hamiltonian for Direct Construction of Safe Set from Trajectory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous-time optimal control, evaluating the Hamiltonian requires solving a constrained optimization problem using the system's dynamics model. Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for safety verification has demonstrated practical utility only when efficient evaluation of the Hamiltonian over a large state-time grid is possible. In this study, we introduce the concept of a data-driven Hamiltonian (DDH), which circumvents the need for an explicit dynamics model by relying only on mild prior knowledge (e.g., Lipschitz constants), thus enabling the construction of reachable sets directly from trajectory data. Recognizing that the Hamiltonian is the optimal inner product between a given costate and realizable state velocities, the DDH estimates the Hamiltonian using the worst-case realization of the velocity field based on the observed state trajectory data. This formulation ensures a conservative approximation of the true Hamiltonian for uncertain dynamics. The reachable set computed based on the DDH is also ensured to be a conservative approximation of the true reachable set. Next, we propose a data-efficient safe experiment framework for gradual expansion of safe sets using the DDH. This is achieved by iteratively conducting experiments within the computed data-driven safe set and updating the set using newly collected trajectory data. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we showcase its effectiveness in safe flight envelope expansion for a tiltrotor vehicle transitioning from near-hover to forward flight.</description>

      <title>On Differential Controllability and Observability Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential balancing theory for nonlinear model reduction relies on differential controllability and observability functions. In this paper, we further investigate them from two different perspectives. First, we establish novel connections between these differential energy functions and their incremental counterparts by assuming the existence of the corresponding optimal state feedback for each controllability function. Specifically, an upper bound on the incremental controllability/observability function is provided by the corresponding differential energy function. Conversely, an upper bound on the differential controllability function can be estimated from the incremental controllability function. Furthermore, the differential observability function can be constructed from the incremental observability function. Second, we explore the positive definiteness of the differential controllability/observability function in the context of controllability/observability and stability.</description>

      <title>A Modular Energy Aware Framework for Multicopter Modeling in Control and Planning Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), especially multicopters, have recently gained popularity for use in surveillance, monitoring, inspection, and search and rescue missions. Their maneuverability and ability to operate in confined spaces make them particularly useful in cluttered environments. For advanced control and mission planning applications, accurate and resource-efficient modeling of UAVs and their capabilities is essential. This study presents a modular approach to multicopter modeling that considers vehicle dynamics, energy consumption, and sensor integration. The power train model includes detailed descriptions of key components such as the lithium-ion battery, electronic speed controllers, and brushless DC motors. Their models are validated with real test flight data. In addition, sensor models, including LiDAR and cameras, are integrated to describe the equipment often used in surveillance and monitoring missions. The individual models are combined into an energy-aware multicopter model, which provide the basis for a companion study on path planning for unmanned aircaft system (UAS) swarms performing search and rescue missions in cluttered and dynamic environments. The flexible modeling approach enables easy description of different UAVs in a heterogeneous UAS swarm, allowing for energy-efficient operations and autonomous decision making for a reliable mission performance.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric B-spline decoupling of multivariate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many scientific fields and applications require compact representations of multivariate functions. For this problem, decoupling methods are powerful techniques for representing the multivariate functions as a combination of linear transformations and nonlinear univariate functions. This work introduces an efficient decoupling algorithm that leverages the use of B-splines to allow a non-parametric estimation of the decoupling's internal functions. The use of B-splines alleviates the problem of choosing an appropriate basis, as in parametric methods, but still allows an intuitive way to tweak the flexibility of the estimated functions. Besides the non-parametric property, the use of B-spline representations allows for easy integration of nonnegativity or monotonicity constraints on the function shapes, which is not possible for the currently available (non-)parametric decoupling methods. The proposed algorithm is illustrated on synthetic examples that highlight the flexibility of the B-spline representation and the ease with which a monotonicity constraint can be added. The examples also show that if monotonic functions are required, enforcing the constraint is necessary.</description>

      <title>Energy Aware and Safe Path Planning for Unmanned Aircraft Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a path planning algorithm for multi-agent unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to autonomously cover a search area, while considering obstacle avoidance, as well as the capabilities and energy consumption of the employed unmanned aerial vehicles. The path planning is optimized in terms of energy efficiency to prefer low energy-consuming maneuvers. In scenarios where a UAS is low on energy, it autonomously returns to its initial position for a safe landing, thus preventing potential battery damage. To accomplish this, an energy-aware multicopter model is integrated into a path planning algorithm based on model predictive control and mixed integer linear programming. Besides factoring in energy consumption, the planning is improved by dynamically defining feasible regions for each UAS to prevent obstacle corner-cutting or over-jumping.</description>

      <title>Verification of Autonomous Neural Car Control with KeYmaera X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a formal model and formal safety proofs for the ABZ'25 case study in differential dynamic logic (dL). The case study considers an autonomous car driving on a highway avoiding collisions with neighbouring cars. Using KeYmaera X's dL implementation, we prove absence of collision on an infinite time horizon which ensures that safety is preserved independently of trip length. The safety guarantees hold for time-varying reaction time and brake force. Our dL model considers the single lane scenario with cars ahead or behind. We demonstrate that dL with its tools is a rigorous foundation for runtime monitoring, shielding, and neural network verification. Doing so sheds light on inconsistencies between the provided specification and simulation environment highway-env of the ABZ'25 study. We attempt to fix these inconsistencies and uncover numerous counterexamples which also indicate issues in the provided reinforcement learning environment.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Conformal Tube MPC for Safe Control in Interactive Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety assurance in multi-agent systems with coupled dynamics is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially when agents exhibit uncertain and state-dependent behaviors. Classical robust control often assumes worst-case disturbances, leading to overly conservative actions. In this work, we propose a learning-based framework that combines conformal prediction with model predictive control (MPC) to ensure probabilistic safety under action-level uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches that predict future states, we directly model the control action of the uncontrollable agent as a stochastic function of the joint state, trained via neural networks and calibrated using conformal prediction. This enables us to construct dynamic, probabilistically guaranteed reachable tubes for the uncontrollable agent. These tubes are then embedded into an MPC formulation to synthesize control actions for the controllable agent that ensure safe interactions over a finite planning horizon. We provide formal stepwise and cumulative safety guarantees, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a pedestrian-vehicle interaction scenario. Compared to baseline methods, our framework achieves higher safety rates while maintaining high performance in terms of speed and responsiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic manipulation in microfluidic devices enables contactless handling of biological cells for Lab-on-Chip applications. This paper analyzes the controllability of multi-particle systems in a one-dimensional acoustic standing wave system using multi-modal actuation. By modeling the system as a nonlinear control system, we analyze its global and local controllability, quantifying these properties in terms of mode numbers. Our results show that sufficient modes enable dense reachability sets, while mode mixing with 10 modes grants a strict notion of controllability to 80\% of the state space in a two-particle system. These findings offer theoretical insights for designing acoustic manipulation algorithms, supporting efficient control in biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic State Estimation of Timed Probabilistic Discrete Event Systems via Artificial Neural Networks [Draft Version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about the state estimation of timed probabilistic discrete event systems. The main contribution is to propose general procedures for developing state estimation approaches based on artificial neural networks. It is assumed that no formal model of the system exists but a data set is available, which contains the history of the timed behaviour of the systems. This dataset will be exploited to develop a neural network model that uses both logical and temporal information gathered during the functioning of the system as inputs and provides the state probability vector as output. Two main approaches are successively proposed (i) state estimation of timed probabilistic discrete event systems over observations: in this case the state estimate is reconstructed at the occurrence of each new observation; (ii) state estimation of timed probabilistic discrete event systems over time: in this case the state estimate is reconstructed at each clock time increment. For each approach, the paper outlines the process of data preprocessing, model building and implementation. This paper not only proposes groundbreaking approaches but also opens the door to further exploitation of artificial neural networks for the benefit of discrete event systems.</description>

      <title>Policy Optimization Algorithms in a Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy optimization algorithms are crucial in many fields but challenging to grasp and implement, often due to complex calculations related to Markov decision processes and varying use of discount and average reward setups. This paper presents a unified framework that applies generalized ergodicity theory and perturbation analysis to clarify and enhance the application of these algorithms. Generalized ergodicity theory sheds light on the steady-state behavior of stochastic processes, aiding understanding of both discounted and average rewards. Perturbation analysis provides in-depth insights into the fundamental principles of policy optimization algorithms. We use this framework to identify common implementation errors and demonstrate the correct approaches. Through a case study on Linear Quadratic Regulator problems, we illustrate how slight variations in algorithm design affect implementation outcomes. We aim to make policy optimization algorithms more accessible and reduce their misuse in practice.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Network Topology in a Two-way Competition for Influence in the Friedkin-Johnsen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider two stubborn agents who compete for `influence' over a strongly connected group of agents. This framework represents real-world contests, such as competition among firms, two-party elections, and sports rivalries, among others. Considering stubbornness of agents to be an immutable property, we utilise the network topology alone to increase the influence of a preferred stubborn agent. We demonstrate this on a special class of strongly connected networks by identifying the supporters of each of the stubborn agents in such networks. Thereafter, we present sufficient conditions under which a network perturbation always increases the influence of the preferred stubborn agent. A key advantage of the proposed topology-based conditions is that they hold independent of the edge weights in the network. Most importantly, we assert that there exists a sequence of perturbations that can make the lesser influential stubborn agent more influential. Finally, we demonstrate our results over the Sampson's Monastery dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an opinion dynamics model coupled with an environmental dynamics. Based on a forward invariance argument, we can simplify the analysis of the asymptotic behavior to the case when all the opinions in the social network are synchronized. Our goal is to emphasize the role of the trust given to the environmental signal in the asymptotic behavior of the opinion dynamics and implicitly of the coupled system. To do that, we conduct a bifurcation analysis of the system around the origin when the trust parameter is varying. Specific conditions are presented for both pitchfork and Hopf bifurcation. Numerical illustration completes the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>State estimation for gas purity monitoring and control in water electrolysis systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Green hydrogen, produced via water electrolysis using renewable energy, is seen as a cornerstone of the energy transition. Coupling of renewable power supplies to water electrolysis processes is, however, challenging, as explosive gas mixtures (hydrogen in oxygen) might form at low loads. This has prompted research into gas purity control of such systems. While these attempts have shown to be successful in theoretical and practical studies, they are currently limited in that they only consider the gas purity at locations where composition measurements are available. As these locations are generally positioned downstream of the disturbance origin, this incurs considerable delays and can lead to undetected critical conditions. In this work, we propose the use of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in combination with a simple process model to estimate and control the gas composition at locations where measurements are not available. The model uses noise-driven states for the gas impurity and is hence agnostic towards any mechanistic disturbance model. We show in simulations that this simple approach performs well under various disturbance types and can reduce the time spent in potentially hazardous conditions by up to one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Limits of "Fairness" of the Variational Generalized Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Nash equilibrum (GNE) problems are commonly used to model strategic interactions between self-interested agents who are coupled in cost and constraints. Specifically, the variational GNE, a refinement of the GNE, is often selected as the solution concept due to it's non-discriminatory treatment of agents by charging a uniform ``shadow price" for shared resources. We study the fairness concept of v-GNEs from a comparability perspective and show that it makes an implicit assumption of unit comparability of agent's cost functions, one of the strongest comparability notions. Further, we introduce a new solution concept, f-GNE in which a fairness metric is chosen a priori which is compatible with the comparability at hand. We introduce an electric vehicle charging game to demonstrate the fragility of v-GNE fairness and compare it to the f-GNE under various fairness metrics.</description>

      <title>Lambda/6 Suspended Patch Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03567v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel, compact antenna design based on a lambda-6th suspended patch configuration that is particularly suited for small-size wireless sensor nodes. The proposed design meets key requirements such as compactness, omnidirectionality, robust source matching over a designated bandwidth, interference immunity, and low costs by evolving the conventional square patch antenna. With a footprint of only 20-by-20 mm, the antenna incorporates a grounded metal shield to both reduce its effective dimensions below one-half wavelength and mitigate interference from nearby circuitry. Simulation results, conducted on a cost-effective FR4 substrate, demonstrate a resonance at 2.45 GHz with a return loss of -32.5 dB and a bandwidth of 50 MHz (at the -10 dB level), making this design an attractive candidate for integration into densely populated wireless sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling Charging Demand and Quantifying Flexibility Bounds for Large-Scale BEV Fleets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a bottom-up method to model baseline charging power demand and quantify available flexibility for large-scale BEV fleets. The method utilizes geographic and sociodemographic information to represent the fleet's mobility and driving energy needs. It models the charging decisions of drivers based on their driving energy needs and range comfort level using real-world data. The flexibility quantification provides an hourly maximum and minimum bound for the charging power and limits the amount of daily flexible charging energy. We apply the methodology to the future fully electrified fleet of Switzerland as a case study and compare the spatio-temporal characteristics of the charging demand and flexibility of different geographic areas and urbanization levels.</description>

      <title>On Word-of-Mouth and Private-Prior Sequential Social Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02913v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social learning provides a fundamental framework in economics and social sciences for studying interactions among rational agents who observe each other's actions but lack direct access to individual beliefs. This paper investigates a specific social learning paradigm known as Word-of-Mouth (WoM), where a series of agents seeks to estimate the state of a dynamical system. The first agent receives noisy measurements of the state, while each subsequent agent relies solely on a degraded version of her predecessor's estimate. A defining feature of WoM is that the final agent's belief is publicly broadcast and adopted by all agents, in place of their own. We analyze this setting both theoretically and through numerical simulations, showing that some agents benefit from using the public belief broadcast by the last agent, while others suffer from performance deterioration.</description>

      <title>Autonomy Architectures for Safe Planning in Unknown Environments Under Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mission planning can often be formulated as a constrained control problem under multiple path constraints (i.e., safety constraints) and budget constraints (i.e., resource expenditure constraints). In a priori unknown environments, verifying that an offline solution will satisfy the constraints for all time can be difficult, if not impossible. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose an online method, building on our previous work "gatekeeper", to guarantee safety and satisfy budget constraints of the system trajectory at all times throughout a mission. 2) Next, we prove that our algorithm is recursively feasible and correct. 3) Finally, instead of using a heuristically designed backup controller, we propose a sampling-based method to construct backup trajectories that both minimize resource expenditure and reach budget renewal sets, in which path constraints are satisfied and the constrained resources are renewed. We demonstrate our approach in simulation with a fixed-wing UAV in a GNSS-denied environment with a budget constraint on localization error that can be renewed at visual landmarks.</description>

      <title>How to Adapt Control Barrier Functions? A Learning-Based Approach with Applications to a VTOL Quadplane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for online adaptation of Control Barrier Function (CBF) parameters, i.e., of the class K functions included in the CBF condition, under input constraints. We introduce the concept of locally validated CBF parameters, which are adapted online to guarantee finite-horizon safety, based on conditions derived from Nagumo's theorem and tangent cone analysis. To identify these parameters online, we integrate a learning-based approach with an uncertainty-aware verification process that account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties inherent in neural network predictions. Our method is demonstrated on a VTOL quadplane model during challenging transition and landing maneuvers, showcasing enhanced performance while maintaining safety.</description>

      <title>Statics of continuum planar grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum robotic grasping, inspired by biological appendages such as octopus arms and elephant trunks, provides a versatile and adaptive approach to object manipulation. Unlike conventional rigid-body grasping, continuum robots leverage distributed compliance and whole-body contact to achieve robust and dexterous grasping. This paper presents a control-theoretic framework for analyzing the statics of continuous contact with a planar object. The governing equations of static equilibrium of the object are formulated as a linear control system, where the distributed contact forces act as control inputs. To optimize the grasping performance, a constrained optimal control problem is posed to minimize contact forces required to achieve a static grasp, with solutions derived using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Furthermore, two optimization problems are introduced: (i) for assigning a measure to the quality of a particular grasp, which generalizes a (rigid-body) grasp quality metric in the continuum case, and (ii) for finding the best grasping configuration that maximizes the continuum grasp quality. Several numerical results are also provided to elucidate our methods.</description>

      <title>GraphSeg: Segmented 3D Representations via Graph Edge Addition and Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots operating in unstructured environments often require accurate and consistent object-level representations. This typically requires segmenting individual objects from the robot's surroundings. While recent large models such as Segment Anything (SAM) offer strong performance in 2D image segmentation. These advances do not translate directly to performance in the physical 3D world, where they often over-segment objects and fail to produce consistent mask correspondences across views. In this paper, we present GraphSeg, a framework for generating consistent 3D object segmentations from a sparse set of 2D images of the environment without any depth information. GraphSeg adds edges to graphs and constructs dual correspondence graphs: one from 2D pixel-level similarities and one from inferred 3D structure. We formulate segmentation as a problem of edge addition, then subsequent graph contraction, which merges multiple 2D masks into unified object-level segmentations. We can then leverage \emph{3D foundation models} to produce segmented 3D representations. GraphSeg achieves robust segmentation with significantly fewer images and greater accuracy than prior methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on tabletop scenes and show that GraphSeg enables improved performance on downstream robotic manipulation tasks.

      <title>The Ground Cost for Optimal Transport of Angular Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal transport problem over angular velocity dynamics given by the controlled Euler equation. The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost equals to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et. al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of a Constant Quaternion Difference Attitude Controller</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is quite often claimed, and correctly so, that linear methods cannot achieve global stability results for attitude control, and conversely that nonlinear control is essential in order to achieve (almost) globally stable tracking of general attitude trajectories. On account of this definitive result, and also because of the existence of powerful nonlinear control techniques, there has been relatively very little work analyzing the limits and performance of linear attitude control. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a characterization of the stability achievable for one class of linear attitude control problems, namely those leading to a constant quaternion difference. In this paper, we analytically derive a critical error angle below which linearized dynamics lead to natural marginal stability for such a system, and above which the system is unstable. The dynamics are then used to derive a locally stable linear attitude controller whose performance is validated using simulations.</description>

      <title>Gradient Field-Based Dynamic Window Approach for Collision Avoidance in Complex Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For safe and flexible navigation in multi-robot systems, this paper presents an enhanced and predictive sampling-based trajectory planning approach in complex environments, the Gradient Field-based Dynamic Window Approach (GF-DWA). Building upon the dynamic window approach, the proposed method utilizes gradient information of obstacle distances as a new cost term to anticipate potential collisions. This enhancement enables the robot to improve awareness of obstacles, including those with non-convex shapes. The gradient field is derived from the Gaussian process distance field, which generates both the distance field and gradient field by leveraging Gaussian process regression to model the spatial structure of the environment. Through several obstacle avoidance and fleet collision avoidance scenarios, the proposed GF-DWA is shown to outperform other popular trajectory planning and control methods in terms of safety and flexibility, especially in complex environments with non-convex obstacles.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Objective MPC for Motion Planning of Seamless Docking Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated vehicles and logistics robots must often position themselves in narrow environments with high precision in front of a specific target, such as a package or their charging station. Often, these docking scenarios are solved in two steps: path following and rough positioning followed by a high-precision motion planning algorithm. This can generate suboptimal trajectories caused by bad positioning in the first phase and, therefore, prolong the time it takes to reach the goal. In this work, we propose a unified approach, which is based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) that unifies the advantages of Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) with a Cartesian MPC to reach a specific goal pose. The paper's main contributions are the adaption of the dynamic weight allocation method to reach path ends and goal poses inside driving corridors, and the development of the so-called dynamic objective MPC. The latter is an improvement of the dynamic weight allocation method, which can inherently switch state-dependent from an MPCC to a Cartesian MPC to solve the path-following problem and the high-precision positioning tasks independently of the location of the goal pose seamlessly by one algorithm. This leads to foresighted, feasible, and safe motion plans, which can decrease the mission time and result in smoother trajectories.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes an event-triggered polynomial control method for trajectory tracking by unicycle robots. In this method, each control input between two consecutive events is a polynomial and its coefficients are chosen to minimize the error in approximating a continuous-time control signal. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of the tracking error and non-Zeno behavior of inter-event times. We illustrate our results through a suite of numerical simulations and experiments, which indicate that the number of events generated by the proposed controller is significantly less compared to that by a time-triggered controller or a event-triggered controller based on zero-order hold while guaranteeing similar tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Showcasing Automated Vehicle Prototypes: A Collaborative Release Process to Manage and Communicate Risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development and deployment of automated vehicles pose major challenges for manufacturers to this day. Whilst central questions, like the issue of ensuring a sufficient level of safety, remain unanswered, prototypes are increasingly finding their way into public traffic in urban areas. Although safety concepts for prototypes are addressed in literature, published work hardly contains any dedicated considerations on a systematic release for their operation. In this paper, we propose an incremental release process for public demonstrations of prototypes' automated driving functionality. We explicate release process requirements, derive process design decisions, and define stakeholder tasks. Furthermore, we reflect on practical insights gained through implementing the release process as part of the UNICAR$agil$ research project, in which four prototypes based on novel vehicle concepts were built and demonstrated to the public. One observation is the improved quality of internal risk communication, achieved by dismantling information asymmetries between stakeholders. Design conflicts are disclosed - providing a contribution to nurture transparency and, thereby, supporting a valid basis for release decisions. We argue that our release process meets two important requirements, as the results suggest its applicability to the domain of automated driving and its scalability to different vehicle concepts and organizational structures.</description>

The transceiver comprises of a full ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter and a full UWB band receiver. A design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented. At the transmitter side, a sub-harmonic mixer is used for signal up-conversion. The receiver low noise amplifier (LNA) has a 2 to 6 GHz input matching bandwidth with a power gain of 9 dB and a noise figure of 2.5 dB. The transceiver is implemented in Cadence EDA tools using 65nm CMOS technology. The system achieves a total dc power consumption of 50 mW. Good noise figure performance; good wide-band matching; gain; high level of integration; low power; low cost of the proposed UWB radar transceiver front-end make it a highly competitive SoC solution for low power UWB transceivers.</description>

      <title>Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving further up to 20.8$\times$ speedup over prevalent embedded CPUs with over 11$\times$ power reduction than GPU and low hardware resource overhead.</description>

      <title>Controlled Social Learning: Altruism vs. Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which a planner may pay a cost to adjust the private information structure of agents. The planner may seek to induce correct actions that are consistent with an unknown true state of the world (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates. This sheds light on practical policy questions, such as how the socially optimal level of ad personalization changes according to current beliefs or how a political campaign may selectively illuminate or obfuscate the winning potential of its candidate among voters. We then prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from the choices they induce in the agents. Even for a planner who has equivalent knowledge to an individual, cannot lie or cherry-pick information, and is fully observable, we demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically influence social welfare in both positive and negative directions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically efficient adaptive identification under saturated output observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As saturated output observations are ubiquitous in practice, identifying stochastic systems with such nonlinear observations is a fundamental problem across various fields. This paper investigates the asymptotically efficient identification problem for stochastic dynamical systems with saturated output observations. In contrast to most of the existing results, our results do not need the commonly used but stringent conditions such as periodic or independent assumptions on the system signals, and thus do not exclude applications to stochastic feedback systems. To be specific, we introduce a new adaptive Newton-type algorithm on the negative log-likelihood of the partially observed samples using a two-step design technique. Under some general excitation data conditions, we show that the parameter estimate is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal by employing the stochastic Lyapunov function method and limit theories for martingales. Furthermore, we show that the mean square error of the estimates can achieve the Cramer-Rao bound asymptotically without resorting to i.i.d data assumptions. This indicates that the performance of the proposed algorithm is the best possible that one can expect in general. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the superiority of our new adaptive algorithm over the existing related ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Price of Simplicity: Analyzing Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the performance cost of using simple, decoupled control policies in inherently coupled systems? Motivated by industrial refrigeration systems, where centralized compressors exhibit economies of scale yet traditional control employs decoupled room-by-room temperature regulation, we address this question through the lens of multi-location inventory control. Here, a planner manages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs that are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing that optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain unchanged despite the coupling when restricting attention to decoupled strategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies relative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio depends primarily on the degree of nonlinearity in the cost function and scales with the number of locations for systems with fixed costs; and (iii) analysis of practical online algorithms that achieve competitive performance without solving complex dynamic programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that while decoupled policies significantly outperform their worst-case guarantees in typical scenarios, they still exhibit meaningful suboptimality compared to fully coordinated strategies. These results provide actionable guidance for system operators navigating the trade-off between control complexity and operational efficiency in coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <title>Distributed AC Optimal Power Flow: A Scalable Solution for Large-Scale Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Control of General Linear Delay Systems under Dissipativity: Part I -- A KSD based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an effective framework for designing memoryless dissipative full-state feedbacks for general linear delay systems via the Krasovski\u{i} functional (KF) approach, where an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays (DDs) exists in the state, input and output. To handle the infinite dimensionality of DDs, we employ the Kronecker-Seuret Decomposition (KSD) which we recently proposed for analyzing matrix-valued functions in the context of delay systems. The KSD enables factorization or least-squares approximation of any number of $\mathcal{L}^2$ DD kernels from any number of DDs without introducing conservatism. This also facilitates the construction of a complete-type KF with flexible integral kernels, following from an application of a novel integral inequality derived from the least-squares principle. Our solution includes two theorems and an iterative algorithm to compute controller gains without relying on nonlinear solvers. A challenging numerical example, intractable for existing methods, underscores the efficacy of this approach.</description>
