      <title>Extreme-case Range Value-at-Risk under Increasing Failure Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme cases of risk measures, when considered within the context of distributional ambiguity, provide significant guidance for practitioners specializing in risk management of quantitative finance and insurance. In contrast to the findings of preceding studies, we focus on the study of extreme-case risk measure under distributional ambiguity with the property of increasing failure rate (IFR). The extreme-case range Value-at-Risk under distributional uncertainty, consisting of given mean and/or variance of distributions with IFR, is provided. The specific characteristics of extreme-case distributions under these constraints have been characterized, a crucial step for numerical simulations. We then apply our main results to stop-loss and limited loss random variables under distributional uncertainty with IFR.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Comprehensive Risk Assessment for Financial Reports: A Lightweight Hierarchical Transformer Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every publicly traded U.S. company files an annual 10-K report containing critical insights into financial health and risk. We propose Tiny eXplainable Risk Assessor (TinyXRA), a lightweight and explainable transformer-based model that automatically assesses company risk from these reports. Unlike prior work that relies solely on the standard deviation of excess returns (adjusted for the Fama-French model), which indiscriminately penalizes both upside and downside risk, TinyXRA incorporates skewness, kurtosis, and the Sortino ratio for more comprehensive risk assessment. We leverage TinyBERT as our encoder to efficiently process lengthy financial documents, coupled with a novel dynamic, attention-based word cloud mechanism that provides intuitive risk visualization while filtering irrelevant terms. This lightweight design ensures scalable deployment across diverse computing environments with real-time processing capabilities for thousands of financial documents which is essential for production systems with constrained computational resources. We employ triplet loss for risk quartile classification, improving over pairwise loss approaches in existing literature by capturing both the direction and magnitude of risk differences. Our TinyXRA achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy across seven test years on a dataset spanning 2013-2024, while providing transparent and interpretable risk assessments. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate our contributions and assess model explanations both quantitatively by systematically removing highly attended words and sentences, and qualitatively by examining explanation coherence. The paper concludes with findings, practical implications, limitations, and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Deep Hedging to Manage Tail Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Buehler et al.'s 2019 Deep Hedging paradigm, we innovatively employ deep neural networks to parameterize convex-risk minimization (CVaR/ES) for the portfolio tail-risk hedging problem. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on crisis-era bootstrap market simulators -- customizable with transaction costs, risk budgets, liquidity constraints, and market impact -- our end-to-end framework not only achieves significant one-day 99% CVaR reduction but also yields practical insights into friction-aware strategy adaptation, demonstrating robustness and operational viability in realistic markets.</description>

      <title>Potential Customer Lifetime Value in Financial Institutions: The Usage Of Open Banking Data to Improve CLV Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly adopt customer-centric strategies to enhance profitability and build long-term relationships. While Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a core metric, its calculations often rely solely on single-entity data, missing insights from customer activities across multiple firms. This study introduces the Potential Customer Lifetime Value (PCLV) framework, leveraging Open Banking (OB) data to estimate customer value comprehensively. We predict retention probability and estimate Potential Contribution Margins (PCM) from competitor data, enabling PCLV calculation. Results show that OB data can be used to estimate PCLV per competitor, indicating a potential upside of 21.06% over the Actual CLV. PCLV offers a strategic tool for managers to strengthen competitiveness by leveraging OB data and boost profitability by driving marketing efforts at the individual customer level to increase the Actual CLV.</description>

      <title>Risk exchange under infinite-mean Pareto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal decisions and equilibria of agents who aim to minimize their risks by allocating their positions over extremely heavy-tailed (i.e., infinite-mean) and possibly dependent losses. The loss distributions of our focus are super-Pareto distributions, which include the class of extremely heavy-tailed Pareto distributions. Using a recent result on stochastic dominance, we show that for a portfolio of super-Pareto losses, non-diversification is preferred by decision makers equipped with well-defined and monotone risk measures. The phenomenon that diversification is not beneficial in the presence of super-Pareto losses is further illustrated by an equilibrium analysis in a risk exchange market. First, agents with super-Pareto losses will not share risks in a market equilibrium. Second, transferring losses from agents bearing super-Pareto losses to external parties without any losses may arrive at an equilibrium which benefits every party involved.</description>
