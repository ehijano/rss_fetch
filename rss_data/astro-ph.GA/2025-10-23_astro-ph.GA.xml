      <title>Living with Neighbors. VI. Unraveling the Dual Impact of Bars on Star Formation in Paired Galaxies Using DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift galaxies ($0.02$\,$&lt;$\,z\,$&lt;$\,$0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$\,2.5 dex higher) than unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF regulation in interacting galaxies.</description>

      <title>Warped Disk Galaxies. II. From the Cosmic Web to the Galactic Warp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to galaxy--galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been proposed as a driver of disk warping. We investigate links among warp morphology, satellite distribution, and large-scale structure using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog of warped disks compiled by Zee et al.\ (2022). Warps are classified into 244 S and 127 U types, hosting 1,373 and 740 satellites, respectively, and are compared to an unwarped control matched in stellar mass, redshift, and local density. As an indirect, population-level proxy for the host halo's shape and orientation, we analyze the stacked spatial distribution of satellites. Warped hosts show a significant anisotropy: an excess at $45^{\circ}&lt;\phi&lt;90^{\circ}$ (measured from the host major axis), peaking at $P(\phi)\simeq 0.003$, versus nearly isotropic controls. Satellites of S-type warps preferentially align with the nearest cosmic filament, whereas those of U-type warps are more often perpendicular. The incidence of warps increases toward filaments ($r_{\rm fil}&lt;4,{\rm Mpc},h^{-1}$), while the number of satellites around warped hosts remains approximately constant with filament distance, indicating a direct influence of the large-scale environment. We discuss possible links between galactic warps and the cosmic web, including anisotropic tidal fields and differences in evolutionary stage.</description>

      <title>The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha emitters as probes of ionized bubble sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ production and intergalactic transmission with an empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to observationally-constrained Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions, we reproduce the rapid decline in Ly$\alpha$ visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles ($\gtrsim 10$ cMpc) have higher observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples with $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha} &gt; 10^{41.5}\ \text{erg s}^{-1}$, Ly$\alpha$ properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude, especially at $z \gtrsim 7$. This simulation-based framework maps LAE selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of reionization.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS) X: Molecular gas clumpiness under the influence of AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter profiles of "in silico" galaxies: deep learning inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.</description>

      <title>Accreted stars and stellar haloes of simulated galaxies in TNG50</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the accreted stellar component and stellar haloes of isolated galaxies spanning a wide range of masses ($10^8&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{11}$). We find that stars formed in the main progenitor (i.e., in-situ stars) typically dominate the inner regions as far as $\sim$10 half-light radii from the centre, implying that detecting uncontrovertible evidence for the presence of an accreted stellar halo requires probing the far outskirts of a galaxy. Stars from accreted, disrupted satellites (i.e., ex-situ stars) dominate beyond that radius (roughly $25\%$ of the virial radius, $r_{200}$), which we identify as the inner boundary of the outer stellar halo. The fraction of accreted stars decreases monotonically with decreasing galaxy mass, $M_*$, from $\sim$$20\%$ on average in $\sim$$2\times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{11}\, M_\odot$) to $2$-$3\%$ in $\sim$$2\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{8}\, M_\odot$). The outer halo has a mass comparable to roughly $10\%$ of all accreted stars. Fewer than $\sim$$30\%$ of stars in the outer halo are in-situ stars, many of which originate from star-forming satellites during the late stages of disruption, especially in low-mass systems. Accreted stars are systematically more metal poor in less massive systems, which makes the outer haloes of dwarf galaxies a fertile hunting ground for extremely metal-poor stars. At given galaxy mass, the more massive stellar haloes are systematically more concentrated (smaller $R_{\rm eff}$) and have steeper density profiles (larger $n$). Our results provide a blueprint for interpreting observations of the outskirts of isolated galaxies in terms of their assembly histories.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Nuclear Environments of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies within 45 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using HST/STIS observations, we present the highest-spatial-resolution spectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies, with the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The stellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals a younger recent starburst ($\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an offset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\sim$550 Myr), a radial age gradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar density of $\sim5900 \pm 800 \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the nucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star clusters. High-ionization ``coronal" emission lines, [Fe VI] $\lambda 5677$, [Fe VII] $\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\lambda 6375$, are also detected within the nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly alongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not detect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence in the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at various radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion episodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger driving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in post-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star formation history on $&lt;$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Optical Colors of Galactic Cirrus Clouds in the Stripe 82 Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have shown that the optical colors of Galactic cirrus clouds differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources; thus, they can be used to distinguish Galactic cirrus from extragalactic low surface brightness (LSB) features. To understand these properties, we calculate radiative transfer models in dust clouds, where photons are incident from the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Dust clouds are modeled to mimic a turbulent medium using a fractional Brownian motion algorithm, resulting in a lognormal density distribution and a power-law power spectral density that are appropriate for the ISM. The results are compared with optical observations of cirrus clouds in the Stripe 82 region. The observed color--color ($g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$) diagrams of the cirrus clouds can be reproduced by scattered light if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of Mathis et al. (as updated by Draine) is modified, either by reducing the intensities in the $i$ and $z$ bands or by enhancing those in the $g$ and $r$ bands. Similar results can also be obtained by adjusting the scattering albedos at the corresponding wavelengths. This demonstrates that the color--color diagrams are effective not only for identifying extragalactic LSB features but also for studying the ISRF and the properties of interstellar dust.</description>

      <title>The slope and scatter of the star forming main sequence at z~5 : reconciling observations with simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as H$\alpha$ emission -- which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\sim4$-$5$ with $\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot) = 6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the ``All the Little Things'' (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR $\propto \mathrm{M}_\star^\alpha$, with $\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for the H$\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to $\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of $\approx1$ expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to $\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from $\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\star=10^8$ M$_\odot$ to $0.4$ dex at M$_\star=10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\alpha$) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of S-stars and G-sources orbiting a supermassive compact object made of fermionic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrounding Sgr A*, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A*. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.</description>

      <title>On the origins, growth, and radiative efficiency of J0529-4351, reportedly the fastest-growing known black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SMSS J0521-4351 is reportedly the most luminous quasar known to date, and assuming a mean radiative efficiency of 0.1, it is inferred to be the fastest-growing black hole, accreting approximately one solar mass per day. Assessing the implications of this assumption on the seed mass and inception time of J0529-4351, we show that the inferred accretion rate is unreasonably high and that its radiative efficiency must be much greater than 0.1. Then, we derive its accretion rate and seed mass, and for comparison of three other similar-size (~1-2E+10 solar masses) black holes at various redshifts, using well-tested empirical scaling relations. The results indicate that J0529-4351 grew from a heavy seed (~2-3E+04 solar masses), and that its accretion rate (~10-13 solar masses/year) is the lowest of the four black holes. However, its radiative efficiency inferred from its bolometric luminosity and the derived accretion rate is the highest, which explains why it is the most luminous despite having the lowest accretion rate. This study challenges the prevailing notion that a higher luminosity or a higher Eddington ratio implies a higher accretion rate, highlights the dependence of a black hole's luminosity on radiative efficiency, reveals the pitfalls of inferring black hole properties assuming a standard value for radiative efficiency, and suggests that the Eddington ratios of high-luminosity BHs may be significantly overestimated.</description>

      <title>Modeling Globular Cluster Counts with Bayesian Latent Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian latent model to describe the scaling relation between globular cluster populations and their host galaxies, updating the framework proposed in de Souza 2015. GC counts are drawn from a negative-binomial (NB) process linked to host stellar mass, augmented with a newly introduced Gaussian observation layer that enables efficient propagation of measurement errors. The revised formulation preserves the underlying NB process while improving computational tractability.

      <title>WALLABY: an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies uncovers the first known ultra-diffuse galaxy pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) we performed an untargeted search for H I-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identified a core sample of 10 UDGs defined by $\mu_{g,0}\ge24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.5$ kpc, and a broader sample including 12 additional faint diffuse galaxies ($\mu_{g,0}\ge23.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.3$ kpc). Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of a UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc), with a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$. The North-Western UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-1) has a larger H I reservoir, $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.95\pm0.03$, compared to the South-Eastern UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-2), $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.60\pm0.04$. UDG-1's stellar mass and star formation rate are also approximately an order of magnitude larger at $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.07\pm0.12$ and $\log_{10}(SFR/\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}) = -1.26\pm0.12$ respectively. The pair has an isolated local environment, with no other galaxies or H I sources within 30 arcmin (525 kpc) and $\pm1000$ km s$^{-1}$. However, in the context of the larger-scale structure, the pair is located outside the virial radius of the Hydra cluster, with its position on the phase-space diagram indicating that it is infalling into the cluster. The identification of this H I-bearing UDG pair raises important questions around the formation of such a unique system and the evolution of UDGs in a transitional phase before ram pressure stripping and cluster infall.</description>

      <title>XRISM mock observations of simulated AGN jets in the core of a galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to heat the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening, observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN feedback processes in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Beyond single tracers: CNN-based inference of galaxy mass profiles from combined gas and stellar kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone. While traditional methods struggle to integrate multi-tracer data effectively, we test whether deep learning models can leverage this joint information. We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components. However, we find limitations in generalizing between simulation suites, with reduced performance when applying models trained on one suite to galaxies from another.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole Growth in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn $z \gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.</description>

      <title>FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations &lt;100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (&lt;10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (&lt; 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).</description>

      <title>Collisional Excitation in Space: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.</description>

Abstract: The initial gravitational collapse of Dark Matter and gas forms a universal filamentary network where the first galaxies form, with shapes and sizes that depend on the choice of Dark Matter. Claims from deep space imaging surveys that elongated galaxies predominate at $z &gt; 3$ are examined here by comparison with detailed hydrodynamical simulations of Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Warm Dark Matter (WDM), and Wave/Fuzzy Dark Matter, $\psi$DM. For CDM and WDM we have sufficient volume, $10^{3}\,\mathrm{Mpc/h}^{3}$, to generate galaxies with stellar masses $&gt; 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 2$, allowing comparison with the CEERS and CANDELS surveys. We find the observed tendency towards elongated, prolate-shaped young galaxies is well matched by WDM, from material accreted along smooth filaments during the first $\simeq 500\,\mathrm{Myr}$, with little dependence on stellar mass. This contrasts with CDM, where the stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal, formed from merging of fragmented filaments. For CDM, several subhalos are predicted to be visible, whereas for WDM and $\psi$DM, early merging is rare. Our findings show how the shapes and sizes of early galaxies are sensitive to the smoothness of the underlying filament network, providing a new constraint on the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cool dark gas in Cygnus X: The first large-scale mapping of low-frequency carbon recombination lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the transition from atomic gas to molecular gas is critical to explain the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274--399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 48' (21 pc) resolution. Of the 30 deg$^2$ surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273$\alpha$ emission from 24 deg$^2$ and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs, which likely originate in CO-dark molecular gas. The morphology of the C273$\alpha$ emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission. We find a correlation between velocity-integrated C273$\alpha$ and the 8 $\mu$m intensity with a power-law slope of $1.3 \pm 0.2$. We interpret the relation as the dependence of cool dark gas emission on the FUV radiation field, $G_0 \approx 40 - 160$. We determine the typical angular separation between C273$\alpha$ and $^{13}$CO emission to be 12 pc. Velocity differences between C273$\alpha$ and $^{13}$CO are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km s$^{-1}$. We estimate gas densities of $n \approx 20 - 900$ cm$^{-3}$ with a nominal $n \approx 400$ cm$^{-3}$ in the C$^{+}$/H$_2$ layer. The evolution of the C273$\alpha$ gas seems to be dominated by turbulent pressure, with a characteristic timescale to form H$_2$ of about 2.6 Myr. These observations underline the richness of low-frequency CRRLs to provide revelatory insights into the characteristics of (CO-)dark gas and the evolution of molecular gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse dwarf galaxies, and particularly ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the role of dark matter due to their large sizes, low surface brightness, and varying dark matter content. In this work, we investigate the gas-rich diffuse dwarf galaxy WALLABY J125956-192430 (aka. KK176) using high-resolution HI data from the WALLABY survey. We produce the most reliable kinematic model for KK176 to date. Using this model, the derived mass decomposition shows that KK176 is dark matter dominated. We also place KK176 on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFR), finding that it is consistent with low-mass dwarf galaxies but distinctly different from reported dark matter-deficient UDGs.</description>

Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from a wide variety of explosion scenarios and progenitor channels. They exhibit a factor of about 10 difference in brightness and, thus, a differentiation in the mass of 56Ni-&gt;56Co-&gt;56 Fe. We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and gamma-rays include both beta + decay of 56 Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WD) close to the Chandrasekhar mass, M(Ch), He-triggered explosions of sub-M Ch WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 1E13 G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SN Ia. We find that this is dominated by normal-bright SNe Ia, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to the Galactic positrons of &lt; 2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, less than 6...20% for M(Ch) and sub-M(Ch), respectively.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Gravitational atoms beyond the test field limit: The case of Sgr A* and ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation. We resolve the region near the horizon as well as the far field region. Our results are relevant in a wide range of masses, from ultralight to MeV scalar fields and for black holes ranging from primordial to supermassive. For instance, a system with a scalar field consistent with ultralight dark matter and a black hole mass comparable to that of Sagittarius A* can be modeled. A density spike near the event horizon, although present, is negligible, contrasting with the prediction in [P. Gondolo and Silk, Phys. Rev. Lett., 83:1719-1722, 1999] for cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>TOPz: Photometric redshifts using template fitting applied to the GAMA survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Accurate photometric redshift estimation is crucial for cosmological and galaxy evolution studies, especially with the advent of large-scale photometric surveys.
  Aims. We developed a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory Photo-z) and applied it to the GAMA photometric catalogue. Using nine-band photometric data from the GAMA project, we assessed the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z estimates to available spectroscopic redshifts from GAMA and DESI. The latter extends to z &lt; 2 and m_Z &lt; 24, allowing the photo-z accuracy to be validated beyond the GAMA limits.
  Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate photo-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. We generated synthetic galaxy spectra using the CIGALE software and ran template set optimisation. We improved the photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical prior was then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift estimates.
  Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the spectroscopic redshifts in the low-redshift regime (z &lt; 0.5). We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various magnitude bins and tested how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the actual uncertainty of the estimates. For the GAMA sample, the sigma_NMAD = 0.012 for m_Z &lt;18 and increases to sigma_NMAD = 0.021 for m_Z &gt;19. The outlier fraction (|dz|/(1 + z)&gt;0.1) in the same magnitude bins increases from 1% to 5%. We show that the TOPz results are consistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes (EAZY and SFM) applied to the same data set.
  Conclusions. TOPz is an advanced photo-z estimation code that integrates flux corrections, physical priors, and template set optimisation to provide state-of-the-art photo-z among competing template-based redshift estimators.</description>

      <title>Exploring the X-ray-radio connection for AGN via measurements of the multi-dimensional luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1538 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\"otes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray-radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray-radio luminosity function across redshift ($0&lt;z&lt;6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-Universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wavenumber of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center, and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Our work thus reveals effects that must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.</description>

      <title>M3DIS -- A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys. II. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.</description>
