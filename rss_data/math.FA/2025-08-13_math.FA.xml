      <title>Common Fixed Points for Weakly Compatible Mappings via Bivariate Auxiliary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish common fixed point theorems for two pairs of weakly compatible self-mappings using an auxiliary function of two variables. Unlike classical results, our theorems do not assume continuity of the mappings and require completeness of only one image set. The use of two-variable auxiliary functions allows us to unify and extend various existing fixed point theorems in metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Theorems for Multivalued Weak Contractions in Cone Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a deep investigation of fixed points for multivalued weak contractions in cone metric spaces. We extend Berinde weak contraction principles to the multivalued setting in cone metric spaces, developing existence, uniqueness, and convergence results. Using the structure of normal cones in Banach spaces, we prove generalized fixed-point theorems for set-valued mappings satisfying weak contractive conditions. The theoretical framework includes iterative approximation schemes with explicit convergence rates and stability analysis of fixed point sets. In the end, some applications to differential inclusions and variational inequalities demonstrate the utility of our results in nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of dual of K-frames in quaternionic Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual of K-frames in a right quaternionic Hilbert space has been recently introduced and studied by Ellouz[1]. In this paper, we study duals of K-frames and prove a characterization of a K-dual in terms of the canonical K-dual of a K-frame in the case when the range of K is not necessarily closed. Moreover, we defined and studied the Approximate K- Dual of a K-frame in a right quaternionic Hilbert space and proved various results for their existence.</description>

      <title>Anchored Implication &amp; Event-Indexed Fixed Points in Hilbert Spaces: Uniqueness and Quantitative Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a synthesis of orthomodular logic (projections as propositions) with operator fixed-point theory in Hilbert spaces. First, we introduce an anchored implication connective $A \Rightarrow^{\mathrm{comm}}_{P} B$, defined semantically so that it is true only when either $A$ is false or else $A$ is true and $B$ is true in a ''commuting'' context specified by a fixed nonzero projection $P$. This connective refines material implication by adding a side condition $[E_B,P]=0$ (commutation of $B$ with the anchor) and reduces to classical implication in the Boolean (commuting) case. Second, we study fixed-point convergence under event-indexed contractions. For a single nonexpansive (not necessarily linear) map $T$, we prove that the event-indexed condition is equivalent to the classical assertion that some power $T^N$ is a strict contraction; thus the ''irregular events'' phrasing does not add generality in that setting. We then present the genuinely more general case of varying operators (switching/randomized): if blocks of the evolving composition are contractive with bounded inter-event gaps and a common fixed point exists, we obtain uniqueness and an explicit envelope rate. Finally, with an anchor $P$ that commutes with $T$, the same reasoning ensures convergence on $PH$ under event-indexed contraction on that subspace. We include precise scope conditions, examples, and visual explanations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Vanishing Campanato Spaces via Ball Banach Function Spaces and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the authors provide some new characterizations of several vanishing Campanato spaces using a type of oscillation defined within the general framework of ball Banach function spaces. This approach yields fresh insights even in the special case of the vanishing BMO space. The characterization reveals a self-improvement phenomenon inherent in vanishing Campanato spaces. A key innovation of this approach lies in using higher-order differences to dominate oscillations. Instead of directly estimating these differences, the authors achieve the domination by smoothing the function via convolution. As additional outcomes, the authors also obtain new characterizations of vanishing Campanato spaces in terms of higher-order differences. Finally, the authors present several examples to show that these vanishing Campanato spaces naturally arise in the study on the compactness of fractional integral commutators in Morrey spaces.</description>

      <title>The Resolvent Mean and The Parametrized $\mathcal{A} \sharp \mathcal{B}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resolvent average and weighted \(\mathcal{A}\sharp \mathcal{H}\)-mean have been defined recently for positive definite matrices. Since the class of accretive matrices provides a general framework for addressing certain known results on positive matrices, this paper extends the notions of resolvent average and the weighted \(\mathcal{A}\sharp \mathcal{H}\)-mean to accretive matrices and discusses some of their properties.\\ The obtained results happen to be legitimate generalizations of those known results on positive definite matrices.\\ Among many results, we show that if $A,B$ are positive definite matrices, and $0\leq\lambda\leq 1, \mu&gt;0$, then \[\mathcal{R}_{\mu}(A,B,1-\lambda,\lambda)+\mu I \geq C \Big(A \sharp_{\bm{\lambda}} B +\mu I\Big),\] where $\mathcal{R}_{\lambda}$ is the resolvent average, $\sharp_{\bm{\lambda}}$ is the weighted geometric mean and $I$ is the identity matrix, for some positive constant $C$; as a new relation between the resolvent average and the geometric mean.</description>

      <title>Some central moments inequalities with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first derive an inequality involving central moments for n real numbers, which in turn provides an extension of Theorem 2.2 of Wolkowicz and Styan [18]. Furthermore, we present refinements of various inequalities obtained by Sharma et al. [12-15] involving central moments for the case of n distinct integers. Moreover, we provide applications of our results in matrix theory and the theory of polynomial equations.</description>

      <title>Weak Centrality for Certain Tensor Products of $C^\ast$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the weak centrality of the tensor product $A\otimes_\alpha B$ of $C^\ast$-algebras $A$ and $B$ in terms of the weak centrality of $A$ and $B$, where $\alpha$ is either the Haagerup or the Banach space projective tensor product. In the due course, we also identify the largest weakly central ideal of $A\otimes_\alpha B$ in certain cases. Centralilty and quasi-centrality of these tensor products are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Self-adjoint realizations of higher-order squeezing operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09044v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order squeezing captures non-Gaussian features of quantum light by probing moments of the field beyond the variance, and is associated with operators involving nonlinear combinations of creation and annihilation operators. Here we study a class of operators of the form $\xi (a^\dag)^ka^l+\xi^\ast (a^\dag)^la^k+f(a^\dag a)$, which arise naturally in the analysis of higher-order quantum fluctuations. The operators are defined on the linear span of Fock states. We show that the essential self-adjointness of these operators depends on the asymptotics of the real-valued function $f(n)$ at infinity. In particular, pure higher-order squeezing operators ($k\geq3$, $l=0$, and $f(n)=0$) are not essentially self-adjoint, but adding a properly chosen term $f(a^\dag a)$, like a Kerr term, can have a regularizing effect and restore essential self-adjointness. In the non-self-adjoint regime, we compute the deficiency indices and classify all self-adjoint extensions. Our results provide a rigorous operator-theoretic foundation for modeling and interpreting higher-order squeezing in quantum optics, and reveal interesting connections with the Birkhoff-Trjitzinsky theory of asymptotic expansions for recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>On a variant of the Grothendieck inequality and estimates on tensor product norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a Grothendieck-type inequality for pairs of Banach spaces $E,F$ assuming $E$ is finite-dimensional and study the associated Grothendieck-type constant. We prove that if there is a $C &gt;0$ such that $\|A\otimes \operatorname{id}_{F}\|_{E_m\check{\otimes}F\to E_n^*\hat{\otimes}F}\leqslant C \|A\|_{E_m\to E_n^*}$ for all $m,n\in\mathbb{N},$ where $\dim E_n=n$, then both $F$ and $F^*$ must have finite cotype. Moreover, assuming that $F$ has the bounded approximation property and that the conjecture in \cite{PisierDuality} has an affirmative answer, we show that $(E_n^*)_{n\geqslant 1}$ satisfies G.T. uniformly. We show that the Grothendieck-type constant defined for a pair of Banach spaces $(E,F)$ is closely related to another interesting quantity introduced recently in \cite{XOR games and GT} comparing the projective and injective norms on the tensor product of two finite-dimensional Banach spaces $E$ and $F$. We also study analogously the constants appearing in these extremal problems by restricting only to non-negative tensors. For contractive \emph{little} Parrott homomorphisms $\varrho_V : H^\infty(\Omega) \to M_{n}$, where $\Omega$ is the dual unit ball of a finite dimensional Banach space $(E,\|\cdot\|)$, we prove the sharp estimate $
\|\varrho_V\|_{\mathrm{cb}}\leq\sqrt{\gamma(E)}, $
$\gamma(E)$ being the positive Grothendieck constant associated with the pair $(E, \ell^n_2)$. %\st{with extremal cases achieving equality.} This yields a new proof of \cite[Theorem 2.1]{Davidchoi} using the lower bound $K_G^+(\ell_\infty^4,\ell_2^2) \geq 1.1658$ obtained in this paper.</description>

      <title>Schatten properties of commutators on metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterise the Schatten class $S^p$ properties of commutators $[b,T]$ of singular integrals and pointwise multipliers in a general framework of (quasi-)metric measure spaces. This covers, unifies, and extends a range of previous results in different special cases. As in the classical results on $\mathbb R^d$, the characterisation has three parts: (1) For $p&gt;d$, we have $[b,T]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is in a suitable Besov (or fractional Sobolev) space. (2) For $p\leq d$, we have $[b,T]\in S^p$ if and only if $b$ is constant. (3) For $p=d$, we have $[b,T]\in S^{d,\infty}$ (a weak-type Schatten class) if and only if $b$ is in a first-order Sobolev space.
  Result (1) extends to all spaces of homogeneous type as long as there are appropriate singular integrals, but for the more delicate properties (2) and (3), we assume a complete doubling metric space supporting a suitable Poincar\'e inequality, which is still very general. These latter results depend on new characterisations of constant functions and Sobolev spaces over such spaces obtained in a companion paper of the author with R. Korte.
  Even when specialised to various concrete domains considered earlier, the present results extend ones available in the literature by covering a larger class of operators with minimal kernel assumptions, removing a-priori assumptions on the pointwise multiplier $b$, and allowing Schatten classes on the weighted spaces $L^2(w)$ with an arbitrary Muckenhoupt weight $w\in A_2$. Even on $\mathbb R^d$, such weighted results were previously known for a few special operators $T$ only, and on all other domains, they are completely new.</description>

      <title>Min-max relations for tuples of operators in terms of component spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For tuples of compact operators $\mathcal{T}=(T_1,\ldots, T_d)$ and $\mathcal{S}=(S_1,$ $\ldots,S_d)$ on Banach spaces over a field $\mathbb{F}$, considering the joint $p$-operator norms on the tuples, we study $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S}),$ the distance of $\mathcal{T}$ from the $d$-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{F}^d\mathcal{S}:=\{\textbf{z}\mathcal{S}:\textbf{z}\in \mathbb{F}^d\}.$ We obtain a relation between $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S})$ and $dist(T_i,\mathbb{F}S_i),$ for $1\leq i\leq d.$ We prove that if $p=\infty,$ then $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S})=\underset{1\leq i\leq d}{\max}dist(T_i,\mathbb{F}S_i),$ and for $1\leq p&lt;\infty,$ under a sufficient condition, $dist(\mathcal{T},\mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S})^p=\underset{1\leq i\leq d}{\sum}dist(T_i,\mathbb{F}S_i)^p.$ As a consequence, we deduce the equivalence of Birkhoff-James orthogonality, $\mathcal{T}\perp_B \mathbb{F}^d\mathcal{S} \Leftrightarrow T_i\perp_B S_i,$ under a sufficient condition. Furthermore, we explore the relation of one sided Gateaux derivatives of $\mathcal{T}$ in the direction of $\mathcal{S}$ with that of $T_i$ in the direction of $S_i.$ Applying this, we explore the relation between the smoothness of $\mathcal{T}$ and $T_i.$ By identifying an operator, whose range is $\ell_\infty^d,$ as a tuple of functionals, we effectively use the results obtained here for operators whose range is $\ell_\infty^d$ and deduce nice results involving functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.05888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fourier(-Stieltjes) algebras on locally compact groups are important commutative Banach algebras in abstract harmonic analysis. In this paper we introduce a generalization of the above two algebras via twisting with respect to 2-cocycles on the group. We also define and investigate basic properties of the associated multiplier spaces with respect to a pair of 2-cocycles. We finally prove a twisted version of the results of Nebbia, Fendler, Bo\.{z}ejko, Losert and Ruan characterizing amenability of the underlying locally compact group through comparison of the twisted Fourier-Stieltjes space with the associated multiplier spaces.</description>

      <title>On the kernel conditions of operators mapping atoms to molecules in local Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the relationship between the operators mapping atoms to molecules in local Hardy spaces $h^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and the size conditions of its kernel. In particular, we show that if the kernel of a Calder\'on--Zygmund-type operator satisfies an integral-type size condition and a $T^*-$type cancellation, then the operator maps $h^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ atoms to molecules. On the other hand, assuming that $T$ is an integral type operator bounded on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ that maps atoms to molecules in $h^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$, then the kernel of such operator satisfies the same integral-type size conditions. We also provide the $L^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $L^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ boundedness for such operators connecting our integral-type size conditions on the kernel with others presented in the literature.</description>
