      <title>Exploring Perceptual Audio Quality Measurement on Stereo Processing Using the Open Dataset of Audio Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ODAQ (Open Dataset of Audio Quality) provides a comprehensive framework for exploring both monaural and binaural audio quality degradations across a range of distortion classes and signals, accompanied by subjective quality ratings. A recent update of ODAQ, focusing on the impact of stereo processing methods such as Mid/Side (MS) and Left/Right (LR), provides test signals and subjective ratings for the in-depth investigation of state-of-the-art objective audio quality metrics. Our evaluation results suggest that, while timbre-focused metrics often yield robust results under simpler conditions, their prediction performance tends to suffer under the conditions with a more complex presentation context. Our findings underscore the importance of modeling the interplay of bottom-up psychoacoustic processes and top-down contextual factors, guiding future research toward models that more effectively integrate both timbral and spatial dimensions of perceived audio quality.</description>

      <title>Building Audio-Visual Digital Twins with Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins today are almost entirely visual, overlooking acoustics-a core component of spatial realism and interaction. We introduce AV-Twin, the first practical system that constructs editable audio-visual digital twins using only commodity smartphones. AV-Twin combines mobile RIR capture and a visual-assisted acoustic field model to efficiently reconstruct room acoustics. It further recovers per-surface material properties through differentiable acoustic rendering, enabling users to modify materials, geometry, and layout while automatically updating both audio and visuals. Together, these capabilities establish a practical path toward fully modifiable audio-visual digital twins for real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Model Attribution and Detection of Synthetic Speech via Audio Residual Fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14013v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As speech generation technologies advance, so do risks of impersonation, misinformation, and spoofing. We present a lightweight, training-free approach for detecting synthetic speech and attributing it to its source model. Our method addresses three tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an open-world setting, (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world setting, and (3) real vs. synthetic speech classification. The core idea is simple: we compute standardized average residuals--the difference between an audio signal and its filtered version--to extract model-agnostic fingerprints that capture synthesis artifacts. Experiments across multiple synthesis systems and languages show AUROC scores above 99%, with strong reliability even when only a subset of model outputs is available. The method maintains high performance under common audio distortions, including echo and moderate background noise, while data augmentation can improve results in more challenging conditions. In addition, out-of-domain detection is performed using Mahalanobis distances to in-domain residual fingerprints, achieving an F1 score of 0.91 on unseen models, reinforcing the method's efficiency, generalizability, and suitability for digital forensics and security applications.</description>

      <title>A Low-Complexity Speech Codec Using Parametric Dithering for ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dithering is a technique commonly used to improve the perceptual quality of lossy data compression. In this work, we analytically and experimentally justify the use of dithering for ASR input compression. We formalize an understanding of optimal ASR performance under lossy input compression and leverage this to propose a parametric dithering technique for a low-complexity speech compression pipeline. The method performs well at 1-bit resolution, showing a 25\% relative CER improvement, while also demonstrating improvements of 32.4\% and 33.5\% at 2- and 3-bit resolution, respectively, with our second dither choice yielding a reduced data rate. The proposed codec is adaptable to meet performance targets or stay within entropy constraints.</description>

      <title>Forensic deepfake audio detection using segmental speech features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice comparison (FVC) are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach audio deepfake detection using methods that are distinct from those employed in traditional FVC, and offer a new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose. In addition, the present study proposes a speaker-specific framework for deepfake detection, which differs fundamentally from the speaker-independent systems that dominate current benchmarks. While speaker-independent frameworks aim at broad generalization, the speaker-specific approach offers advantages in forensic contexts where case-by-case interpretability and sensitivity to individual phonetic realization are essential.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Assessment of Pathological Voices via Combined Low-Level Descriptors and Foundation Model Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditional methods, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scales, rely on expert raters and are prone to inter-rater variability, emphasizing the need for objective solutions. This study introduces the Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning framework that employs an attention mechanism and Speech Foundation Model (SFM) embeddings to extract high-level features. To further enhance performance, we propose VOQANet+, which integrates self-supervised SFM embeddings with low-level acoustic descriptors-namely jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A), our models are evaluated on both vowel-level and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S) to assess generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that sentence-based inputs yield higher accuracy, particularly at the patient level. Overall, VOQANet consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even greater performance gains. Additionally, VOQANet+ maintains consistent performance under noisy conditions, suggesting enhanced robustness for real-world and telehealth applications. This work highlights the value of combining SFM embeddings with low-level features for accurate and robust pathological voice assessment.</description>

      <title>It Hears, It Sees too: Multi-Modal LLM for Depression Detection By Integrating Visual Understanding into Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.</description>
