      <title>Metrology of Complexity and Implications for the Study of the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the longest standing open problems in science is how life arises from non-living matter. If it is possible to measure this transition in the lab, then it might be possible to understand the physical mechanisms by which the emergence of life occurs, which so far have evaded scientific understanding. A significant hurdle is the lack of standards or a framework for cross comparison across different experimental contexts and planetary environments. In this essay, I review current challenges in experimental approaches to origin of life chemistry, focusing on those associated with quantifying experimental selectivity versus de novo generation of molecular complexity, and I highlight new methods using molecular assembly theory to measure molecular complexity. This metrology-centered approach can enable rigorous testing of hypotheses about the cascade of major transitions in molecular order marking the emergence of life, while potentially bridging traditional divides between metabolism-first and genetics-first scenarios. Grounding the study of life's origins in measurable complexity has significant implications for the search for life beyond Earth, suggesting paths toward theory-driven detection of biological complexity in diverse planetary contexts. As the field moves forward, standardized measurements of molecular complexity may help unify currently disparate approaches to understanding how matter transforms to life. Much remains to be done in this exciting frontier.</description>

      <title>Co-Evolution-Based Metal-Binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein-metal interactions is central to structural biology, with metal ions being vital for catalysis, stability, and signal transduction. Predicting metal-binding residues and metal types remains challenging due to the structural and evolutionary complexity of proteins. Conventional sequence- and structure-based methods often fail to capture co-evolutionary constraints that reflect how residues evolve together to maintain metal-binding functionality. Recent co-evolution-based methods capture part of this information, but still underutilize the complete co-evolved residue network. To address this limitation, we introduce the Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network (MBGNN), which leverages the complete co-evolved residue network to better capture complex dependencies within protein structures. Experimental results show that MBGNN substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art co-evolution-based method MetalNet2, achieving F1 score improvements of 2.5% for binding residue identification and 3.3% for metal type classification on the MetalNet2 dataset. Its superiority is further demonstrated on both the MetalNet2 and MIonSite datasets, where it outperforms two co-evolution-based and two sequence-based methods, achieving the highest mean F1 scores across both prediction tasks. These findings highlight how integrating co-evolutionary residue networks with graph-based learning advances our ability to decode protein-metal interactions, thereby facilitating functional annotation and rational metalloprotein design. The code and data are released at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</description>
