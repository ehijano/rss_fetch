      <title>Learning Generalized Statistical Mechanics with Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a variational algorithm based on Matrix Product States that is trained by minimizing a generalized free energy defined using Tsallis entropy instead of the standard Gibbs entropy. As a result, our model can generate the probability distributions associated with generalized statistical mechanics. The resulting model can be efficiently trained, since the resulting free energy and its gradient can be calculated exactly through tensor network contractions, as opposed to standard methods which require estimating the Gibbs entropy by sampling. We devise a variational annealing scheme by ramping up the inverse temperature, which allows us to train the model while avoiding getting trapped in local minima. We show the validity of our approach in Ising spin-glass problems by comparing it to exact numerical results and quasi-exact analytical approximations. Our work opens up new possibilities for studying generalized statistical physics and solving combinatorial optimization problems with tensor networks.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of metric tensor in thermodynamic geometry in terms of relaxation timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Usually, the Carnot efficiency cannot be achieved with finite power due to the quasi-static process, which requires infinitely slow operation speed. It is necessary to tolerate extra dissipation to obtain finite power. In the slow-driving linear response regime, this dissipation can be described as dissipated availability in a geometrical way. The key to this geometrical method is the thermodynamic length characterized by a metric tensor defined on the space of control variables. In this paper, we show that the metric tensor for Langevin dynamics can be decomposed in terms of the relaxation times of a system. As an application of the decomposition of the metric tensor, we show that it is possible to achieve Carnot efficiency at finite power by taking the vanishing limit of relaxation times without breaking trade-off relations between efficiency and power.</description>

      <title>Finite-time thermodynamic bounds and tradeoff relations for information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In thermal environments, information processing requires thermodynamic costs determined by the second law of thermodynamics. Information processing within finite time is particularly important, since fast information processing has practical significance but is inevitably accompanied by additional dissipation. In this paper, we reveal the fundamental thermodynamic costs and the tradeoff relations between incompatible information processing such as measurement and feedback in the finite-time regime. To this end, we generalize optimal transport theory so as to be applicable to subsystems such as the memory and the engine in Maxwell's demon setups. Specifically, we propose a general framework to derive the Pareto fronts of entropy productions and thermodynamic activities, and provide a geometrical perspective on their structure. In an illustrative example, we find that even in situations where naive optimization of total dissipation cannot realize the function of Maxwell's demon, reduction of the dissipation in the feedback system according to the tradeoff relation enables the realization of the demon. We also show that an optimal Maxwell's demon can be implemented by using double quantum dots. Our results would serve as a designing principle of efficient thermodynamic machines performing information processing, from single electron devices to biochemical signal transduction.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry restoration in the Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry is an observable independent tool to investigate the relaxation of quantum many body systems through the restoration of an initially broken symmetry of the dynamics. In this paper we use this to investigate the effects of interactions on quantum relaxation in a paradigmatic integrable model. Specifically, we study the dynamical restoration of the $U(1)$ symmetry corresponding to rotations about the $z$-axis in the XXZ model quenched from a tilted ferromagnetic state. We find two distinct patterns of behaviour depending upon the interaction regime of the model. In the gapless regime, at roots of unity, we find that the symmetry restoration is predominantly carried out by bound states of spinons of maximal length. The velocity of these bound states is suppressed as the anisotropy is decreased towards the isotropic point leading to slower symmetry restoration. By varying the initial tilt angle, one sees that symmetry restoration is slower for an initally smaller tilt angle, signifying the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect. In the gapped regime however, spin transport for non maximally tilted states, is dominated by smaller bound states with longer bound states becoming frozen. This leads to a much longer time scales for restoration compared to the gapless regime. In addition, the quantum Mpemba effect is absent in the gapped regime.</description>

      <title>PiNNAcLe: Adaptive Learn-On-The-Fly Algorithm for Machine-Learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PiNNAcLe is an implementation of our adaptive learn-on-the-fly algorithm for running machine-learning potential (MLP)-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations -- an emerging approach to simulate the large-scale and long-time dynamics of systems where empirical forms of the PES are difficult to obtain.
  The algorithm aims to solve the challenge of parameterizing MLPs for large-time-scale MD simulations, by validating simulation results at adaptive time intervals. This approach eliminates the need of uncertainty quantification methods for labelling new data, and thus avoids the additional computational cost and arbitrariness thereof.
  The algorithm is implemented in the NextFlow workflow language (Di Tommaso et al., 2017). Components such as MD simulation and MLP engines are designed in a modular fashion, and the workflows are agnostic to the implementation of such modules. This makes it easy to apply the same algorithm to different references, as well as scaling the workflow to a variety of computational resources.
  The code is published under BSD 3-Clause License, the source code and documentation are hosted on Github. It currently supports MLP generation with the atomistic machine learning package PiNN (Shao et al., 2020), electronic structure calculations with CP2K (K\"uhne et al., 2020) and DFTB+ (Hourahine et al., 2020), and MD simulation with ASE (Larsen et al., 2017).</description>

      <title>Inferring hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, it has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point distributions as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structure allows for inferring hyperuniformity. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally, for instance entering the structure factor, can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.</description>

      <title>Diffusion crossover from/to $q$-statistics to/from Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics in the classical inertial $\alpha$-XY ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the angular diffusion in a classical $d-$dimensional inertial XY model with interactions decaying with the distance between spins as $r^{-\alpha}$, wiht $\alpha\geqslant 0$. After a very short-time ballistic regime, with $\sigma_\theta^2\sim t^2$, a super-diffusive regime, for which $\sigma_\theta^2\sim t^{\alpha_D}$, with $\alpha_D \simeq 1\text{.}45$ is observed, whose duration covers an initial quasistationary state and its transition to a second plateau characterized by the Boltzmann-Gibbs temperature $T_\text{BG}$. Long after $T_\text{BG}$ is reached, a crossover to normal diffusion, $\sigma_\theta^2\sim t$, is observed. We relate, for the first time, via the expression $\alpha_D = 2/(3 - q)$, the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha_D$ with the entropic index $q$ characterizing the time-averaged angles and momenta probability distribution functions (pdfs), which are given by the so called $q-$Gaussian distributions, $f_q(x)\propto e_q(-\beta x^2)$, where $e_q (u) \equiv [1 + (1 - q)u]^{\frac{1}{1 - q}}$ ($e_1(u) = \exp(u)$). For fixed size $N$ and large enough times, the index $q_\theta$ characterizing the angles pdf approaches unity, thus indicating a final relaxation to Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium. For fixed time and large enough $N$, the crossover occurs in the opposite sense.</description>

      <title>Structural Robustness and Vulnerability of Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are useful descriptions of the structure of many complex systems. Unsurprisingly, it is thus important to analyze the robustness of networks in many scientific disciplines. In applications in communication, logistics, finance, ecology, biomedicine, and many other fields, researchers have studied the robustness of networks to the removal of nodes, edges, or other subnetworks to identify and characterize robust network structures. A major challenge in the study of network robustness is that researchers have reported that different and seemingly contradictory network properties are correlated with a network's robustness. Using a framework by Alderson and Doyle~\cite{Alderson2010}, we categorize several notions of network robustness and we examine these ostensible contradictions. We survey studies of network robustness with a focus on (1)~identifying robustness specifications in common use, (2)~understanding when these specifications are appropriate, and (3)~understanding the conditions under which one can expect different notions of robustness to yield similar results. With this review, we aim to give researchers an overview of the large, interdisciplinary body of work on network robustness and develop practical guidance for the design of computational experiments to study a network's robustness.</description>

      <title>Proposal for experimental realization of quantum spin chains with quasiperiodic interaction using Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating localization properties of interacting disordered systems plays a crucial role in understanding thermalization and its absence in closed quantum systems. However, simulating such systems on classical computers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a method to realize S = 1/2 and S = 1 quantum spin models with quasiperiodic interaction using Rydberg atoms by utilizing the high tunability of their spatial position. We also perform numerical calculations and show that these models host a many-body critical regime, which differs from the ergodic and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Rigidity transitions in anisotropic networks happen in multiple steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the rigidity transition in a triangular lattice changes as a function of anisotropy by preferentially filling bonds on the lattice in one direction. We discover that the onset of rigidity in anisotropic spring networks arises in at least two steps, reminiscent of the two-step melting transition in two dimensional crystals. In particular, our simulations demonstrate that the percolation of stress-supporting bonds happens at different critical volume fractions along different directions. By examining each independent component of the elasticity tensor, we determine universal exponents and develop universal scaling functions to analyze isotropic rigidity percolation as a multicritical point. We expect that these results will be important for elucidating the underlying mechanical phase transitions governing the properties of biological materials ranging from the cytoskeletons of cells to the extracellular networks of tissues such as tendon where the networks are often preferentially aligned.</description>

      <title>Mean square displacement of intruders in freely cooling multicomponent granular mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean square displacement (MSD) of intruders (tracer particles) immersed in a multicomponent granular mixture made up of smooth inelastic hard spheres in a homogeneous cooling state is explicitly computed. The multicomponent granular mixture is constituted by $s$ species with different masses, diameters, and coefficients of restitution. In the hydrodynamic regime, the time decay of the granular temperature of the mixture gives rise to a time decay of the intruder's diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The corresponding MSD of the intruder is determined by integrating the corresponding diffusion equation. As expected from previous works on binary mixtures, we find a logarithmic time dependence of the MSD which involves the coefficient $D_0$. To analyze the dependence of the MSD on the parameter space of the system, the diffusion coefficient is explicitly determined by considering the so-called second Sonine approximation (two terms in the Sonine polynomial expansion of the intruder's distribution function). The theoretical results for $D_0$ are compared with those obtained by numerically solving the Boltzmann equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We show that the second Sonine approximation improves the predictions of the first Sonine approximation, especially when the intruders are much lighter than the particles of the granular mixture. In the long-time limit, our results for the MSD agree with those recently obtained by Bodrova [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{109}, 024903 (2024)] when $D_0$ is determined by considering the first Sonine approximation.</description>

      <title>Effective diffusion along the backbone of combs with finite-span 1D and 2D fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in complex heterogeneous media such as biological tissues or porous materials typically involves constrained displacements in tortuous structures and {\em sticky} environments. Therefore, diffusing particles experience both entropic (excluded-volume) forces and the presence of complex energy landscapes. In this situation, one may describe transport through an effective diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we examine comb structures with finite-length 1D and finite-area 2D fingers, which act as purely diffusive traps. We find that there exists a critical width of 2D fingers above which the effective diffusion along the backbone is faster than for an equivalent arrangement of 1D fingers. Moreover, we show that the effective diffusion coefficient is described by a general analytical form for both 1D and 2D fingers, provided the correct scaling variable is identified as a function of the structural parameters. Interestingly, this formula corresponds to the well-known general situation of diffusion in a medium with fast reversible adsorption. Finally, we show that the same formula describes diffusion in the presence of dilute potential energy traps, e.g. through a landscape of square wells. While diffusion is ultimately always the results of microscopic interactions (with particles in the fluid, other solutes and the environment), effective representations are often of great practical use. The results reported in this paper help clarify the microscopic origins and the applicability of global, integrated descriptions of diffusion in complex media.</description>

Abstract: Stationary measures of last passage percolation with geometric weights and the log-gamma polymer in a strip of the $\mathbb Z^2$ lattice are characterized in arXiv:2306.05983 using variants of Schur and Whittaker processes, called two-layer Gibbs measures. In this article, we prove contour integral formulas characterizing the multipoint joint distribution of two-layer Schur and Whittaker processes. We also express them as Doob transformed Markov processes with explicit transition kernels. As an example of application of our formulas, we compute the growth rate of the KPZ equation on $[0,L]$ with arbitrary boundary parameters.</description>

Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed electronic structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the iconic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of spin glasses. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability in the dressed electronic structure (spontaneous replica symmetry breaking), which could provide the long-sought seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. This mapping paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as frustration, aging dynamics, excess of thermal fluctuations, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the mapping also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems and it suggests novel theoretical directions such as polarization glasses with explicitly time-dependent order parameter functions.</description>

      <title>Accurate Estimation of Diffusion Coefficients and their Uncertainties from Computer Simulation</title>

Abstract: Self-diffusion coefficients, $\D$, are routinely estimated from molecular dynamics simulations by fitting a linear model to the observed mean-squared displacements (MSDs) of mobile species. MSDs derived from simulation exhibit statistical noise that causes uncertainty in the resulting estimate of $\D$. An optimal scheme for estimating $\D$ minimises this uncertainty, i.e., it will have high statistical efficiency, and also gives an accurate estimate of the uncertainty itself. We present a scheme for estimating $\D$ from a single simulation trajectory with high statistical efficiency and accurately estimating the uncertainty in the predicted value. The statistical distribution of MSDs observable from a given simulation is modelled as a multivariate normal distribution using an analytical covariance matrix for an equivalent system of freely diffusing particles, which we parameterise from the available simulation data. We use Bayesian regression to sample the distribution of linear models that are compatible with this multivariate normal distribution, to obtain a statistically efficient estimate of $D^*$ and an accurate estimate of the associated statistical uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Identifying vegetation patterns for a qualitative assessment of land degradation using a cellular automata model and satellite imagery</title>

Abstract: We aim to identify the spatial distribution of vegetation and its growth dynamics with the purpose of obtaining a qualitative assessment of vegetation characteristics tied to its condition, productivity and health, and to land degradation. To do so, we compare a statistical model of vegetation growth and land surface imagery derived vegetation indices. Specifically, we analyze a stochastic cellular automata model and data obtained from satellite images, namely using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). In the experimental data, we look for areas where vegetation is broken into small patches and qualitatively compare it to the percolating, fragmented, and degraded states that appear in the cellular automata model. We model the periodic effect of seasons, finding numerical evidence of a periodic fragmentation and recovery phenomenology if the model parameters are sufficiently close to the model's percolation transition. We qualitatively recognize these effects in real-world vegetation images and consider them a signal of increased environmental stress and vulnerability. Finally, we show an estimation of the environmental stress in land images by considering both the vegetation density and its clusterization.</description>

Abstract: This is a conference proceeding in the framework of workshop "OpenQMBP2023" at Institute Pascal (Orsay, France) and associated to the lecture given by Prof. Ehud Altman. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent results in the context of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum systems, with a particular focus on hybrid quantum circuits as a model system in one-dimension. Recent results, demonstrate how varying the rate of projective measurements can induce phase transitions, resulting in abrupt changes in the properties of the entanglement. The interplay between unitary evolution and measurement processes can be investigated, through mappings to classical statistical models and the application of replica field theory techniques. Starting from a low-entangled state, there can be three regimes characterized by different dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropies for a portion of the system: high-rate measurements leading to rapid entanglement saturation (area law), low-rate measurements allowing linear entanglement growth (up to volume law), and a critical rate at which entanglement grows logarithmically. Finally, we present results on the non-local effects of local measurements by examining the field theory of critical ground states in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>Generalized $\alpha$-Observational Entropy and Thermodynamic Entropy Production</title>

Abstract: Traditional measures of entropy, like the Von Neumann entropy, while fundamental in quantum information theory, are insufficient when interpreted as thermodynamic entropy due to their invariance under unitary transformations, which contradicts observed entropy increases in isolated systems. Recognizing this limitations of existing measures for thermodynamic entropy, recent research has focused on observational entropy (OE) as a promising alternative, offering practical applicability and theoretical insights. In this work, we extend the scope of observational entropy by generalizing it to a parameterized version called $\alpha$-Observational entropy ($\alpha$-OE). $\alpha$-OE is expressed in terms of the Petz-R\'{e}nyi relative entropy between the states on which a quantum-to-classical channel is applied. The $\alpha$-OE reduces to OE under $\alpha\rightarrow 1$. We prove various properties of the $\alpha$-OE, which are the generalization of the properties of OE, including the monotonically increasing of $\alpha$-OE as a function of refinement of coarse-graining. We further explore the role of $\alpha$-OE in thermodynamic contexts, particularly for the entropy production in open and closed quantum systems and its relation with the Helmholtz free energy.</description>

      <title>Boundary Chaos: Spectral Form Factor</title>

Abstract: Random matrix spectral correlations is a defining feature of quantum chaos. Here, we study such correlations in a minimal model of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics where interactions are confined to the system's boundary, dubbed \textit{boundary chaos}, in terms of the spectral form factor and its fluctuations. We exactly calculate the latter in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ for different classes of random boundary interactions and find it to coincide with random matrix theory, possibly after a non-zero Thouless time. The latter effect is due to a drastic enhancement of the spectral form factor, when integer time and system size fulfill a resonance condition. We compare our semiclassical (large $q$) results with numerics at small local Hilbert space dimension ($q=2,3$) and observe qualitatively similar features as in the semiclassical regime.</description>

      <title>Prerelaxation in quantum, classical, and quantum-classical two-impurity models</title>

Abstract: We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems, focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.</description>

      <title>Locality, Correlations, Information, and non-Hermitian Quantum Systems</title>

Abstract: Local non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems generically exhibit breakdown of Lieb-Robinson (LR) bounds, motivating study of whether new locality measures might shed light not seen by existing measures. In this paper we extend the standard connected correlation function (CC) to NH systems in a form that recovers locality. Additionally, we use the metric formalism to derive a modified CC which recovers not just locality but even LR bounds in local $PT$-Symmetric systems, and discuss extensions of both CCs to the $n$-partite case. We show that in Hermitian systems $\delta\rho = \rho-\rho_A\otimes\rho_B$ can be written as a linear combination of CCs, allowing us to place an LR bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$. We show this generically extends to an LR bound on mutual information as well. We then extend this to NH systems, where we show its violations can be used to place a necessary condition on which NH Hamiltonians are capable of nonlocal entanglement generation. Numerical simulations are provided by means of exact diagonalization for the NH Transverse-Field Ising Model, demonstrating both breakdown and recovery of LR bounds.</description>
