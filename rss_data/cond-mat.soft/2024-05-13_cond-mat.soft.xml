      <title>Active nematic fluids on Riemannian 2-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in cell biology and experimental techniques using reconstituted cell extracts have generated significant interest in understanding how geometry and topology influence active fluid dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive continuous theory and computational method to explore the dynamics of active nematic fluids on arbitrary surfaces without topological constraints. The fluid velocity and nematic order parameter are represented as the sections of the complex line bundle of a 2-manifold. We introduce the Levi-Civita connection and surface curvature form within the framework of complex line bundles. By adopting this geometric approach, we introduce a gauge-invariant discretization method that preserves the continuous local-to-global theorems in differential geometry. We establish a nematic Laplacian on complex functions that can accommodate fractional topological charges through the covariant derivative on the complex nematic representation. We formulate advection of the nematic field based on a unifying definition of the Lie derivative, resulting in a stable geometric semi-Lagrangian discretization scheme for transport by the flow. In general, the proposed surface-based method offers an efficient and stable means to investigate the influence of local curvature and global topology on the 2D hydrodynamics of active nematic systems. Moreover, the complex line representation of the nematic field and the unifying Lie advection present a systematic approach for generalizing our method to active $k$-atic systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Insights into Polyelectrolyte Complexation: A Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a theoretical framework to investigate the interactions between flexible polymer chains, specifically polyelectrolytes (PEs). By calculating the system's free energy while considering position-dependent mutual interactions and chain conformations, we gain insights into the local dielectricity as PEs overlap. Our analysis reveals that the thermodynamic drive for complex coacervation is influenced by factors such as the number of ions bound to the polymer backbone and the entropy associated with free ions, challenging earlier assumptions about the relationship between entropy gain and electrostatic temperature. We demonstrate that global thermodynamic behavior is strongly influenced by local factors like dielectric constant, providing clarity on discrepancies between experimental and computational studies. Additionally, we found that entropy gain is inversely proportional to the local dielectric constant, assuming a constant electrostatic temperature. Our findings highlight the importance of considering polymer-specific parameters when exploring the thermodynamic behavior of charged polymer complexation.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities in the order parameter space that are mathematically described by topological invariants and cannot be removed by continuous transformations. These defects play a significant role in various fields, ranging from cosmology to solid-state physics and biological matter. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, leading to decades of debate about the existence of topological defects in disordered systems, such as glasses. Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects might emerge in the dynamical properties of glasses under deformation, potentially relating to their plastic behavior. In this study, we investigate a two-dimensional colloidal glass system composed of particles interacting by an effective magnetic repulsion. We reveal the presence of topological defects in the eigenspace of the vibrational frequencies of this experimental 2D amorphous solid. The vibrational density of states of this 2D amorphous material exhibits distinct glassy properties such as the presence of a boson peak anomaly. Through extensive numerical and theoretical quantitative analysis, we establish a robust positive correlation between the vibrational characteristics and the total number of topological defects. We furthermore show that defects of opposite charge tend to pair together and prove their local statistical correlation with the "soft spots", the regions more prone to plastic flow. This work provides the experimental confirmation for the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing a complex interplay between topology, disorder, and vibrational behavior.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent current response theory of jamming and vibrational modes in low-temperature amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study amorphous solids with strong elastic disorder and find an un-jamming instability that exists, inter alia, in an harmonic model built using Euclidean random matrices (ERM). Employing the Zwanzig-Mori projection operator formalism and Gaussian factorization approximations, we develop a first-principles, self-consistent theory of transverse momentum correlations in athermal disordered materials, extending beyond the standard Born approximation. The vibrational anomalies in glass at low temperatures are recovered in the stable solid limit, and floppy modes lacking restoring forces are predicted in unstable states below the jamming transition. Near the un-jamming transition, the speed of sound $v_0^\perp$ vanishes with $ \propto \sqrt{\epsilon}$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the distance from the critical point. Additionally, the density of states develops a plateau, independent of $\epsilon$ above a frequency $\omega_*$ which vanishes at the transition, $\omega_*\propto |\epsilon|$. We identify a characteristic length scale in the un-jammed phase, $\lambda_-^\perp\propto1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$, indicating the distance over which injected momentum remains correlated. We confirm the theoretical predictions with numerical solutions of a scalar ERM model, demonstrating overall good qualitative and partly quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Density and inertia effects on two-dimensional active semiflexible filament suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the influence of density on the transition between chain and spiral structures in planar assemblies of active semiflexible filaments, utilizing detailed numerical simulations. We focus on how increased density, and higher P\'eclet numbers, affect the activity-induced transition spiral state in a semiflexible, self-avoiding active chain. Our findings show that increasing the density causes the spiral state to break up, reverting to a motile chain-like shape. This results in a density-dependent reentrant phase transition from spirals back to open chains. We attribute this phenomenon to an inertial effect observed at the single polymer level, where increased persistence length due to inertia has been shown in recent three-dimensional studies to cause polymers to open up. Our two-dimensional simulations further reveal that a reduction in the damping coefficient leads to partial unwinding of the spirals, forming longer arms. In suspension, interactions among these extended arms can trigger a complete unwinding of the spirals, driven by the combined effects of density and inertia.</description>

      <title>An explicit granular-mechanics approach to marine sediment acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we theoretically and computationally study the frequency dependence of phase speed and attenuation for marine sediments from the perspective of granular mechanics. We leverage recent theoretical insights from the granular physics community as well as discrete-element method simulations, where the granular material is treated as a packing of discrete objects that interact via pairwise forces. These pairwise forces include both repulsive contact forces as well as dissipative terms which may include losses from the fluid as well as losses from inelasticity at grain-grain contacts. We show that the structure of disordered granular packings leads to anomalous scaling laws for frequency-dependent phase speed and attenuation that do not follow from a continuum treatment. Our results demonstrate that granular packing structure, which is not explicitly considered in existing models, may play a crucial role in a complete theory of sediment acoustics. While this simple approach does not explicitly treat sound propagation or inertial effects in the interstitial fluid, it provides a starting point for future models that include these and other more complex features.</description>

      <title>Assorted remarks on bending measures and energies for plates and shells, and their invariance properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we address several issues, including some raised in recent works and commentary, related to bending measures and energies for plates and shells, and certain of their invariance properties. We discuss the distinction between definitions and results in our and others' approaches, correct an error and citation oversights in our work, and provide additional brief observations regarding the relative size of energetic terms and the symmetrization of bending measures. Particular points of emphasis are a reiteration of some of the early history of dilation-invariant measures, the similarities between all such measures, and the non-dilation-invariance of our recently introduced bending measure for shells and curved rods. In the course of this discussion, we provide a simpler presentation of the elementary, but much overlooked, fact that the additional tangential stretch of material near the mid-surface of a thin body is the product of the mid-surface stretch and the change in curvature.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects on the Electronic Structure of Water and Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic properties and optical response of ice and water are intricately shaped by their molecular structure, including the quantum mechanical nature of hydrogen atoms. In spite of numerous studies appeared over decades, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of the nuclear quantum motion on the electronic structure of water and ice at finite temperatures remains elusive. Here, we utilize molecular simulations that harness the efficiency of machine-learning potentials and many-body perturbation theory to assess the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the electronic structure of water and hexagonal ice. By comparing the results of path-integral and classical simulations, we find that including nuclear quantum effects leads to a larger renormalization of the fundamental gap of ice, compared to that of water, eventually leading to a comparable gap in the two systems, consistent with experimental estimates. Our calculations suggest that the quantum fluctuations responsible for an increased delocalization of protons in ice, relative to water, are a key factor leading to the enhancement of nuclear quantum effects on the electronic structure of ice.</description>

      <title>Local topology and perestroikas in protein structure and folding dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods of local topology are introduced to the field of protein physics. This is achieved by explaining how the folding and unfolding processes of a globular protein alter the local topology of the protein's C-alpha backbone through conformational bifurcations. The mathematical formulation builds on the concept of Arnol'd's perestroikas, by extending it to piecewise linear chains using the discrete Frenet frame formalism. In the low-temperature folded phase, the backbone geometry generalizes the concept of a Peano curve, with its modular building blocks modeled by soliton solutions of a discretized nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The onset of thermal unfolding begins when perestroikas change the flattening and branch points that determine the centers of solitons. When temperature increases, the perestroikas cascade, which leads to a progressive disintegration of the modular structures. The folding and unfolding processes are quantitatively characterized by a correlation function that describes the evolution of perestroikas under temperature changes. The approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the Physics of protein folding and unfolding transitions, contributing to the broader field of protein structure and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Facilitation Governs the Equilibration Dynamics of Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convincing evidence of domain growth in the heating of ultrastable glasses suggests that the equilibration dynamics of super-cooled liquids could be driven by a nucleation and growth mechanism. We investigate this possibility by simulating the equilibration dynamics of a model glass during both heating and cooling between poorly and well-annealed states. Though we do observe the growth of domains during heating, we find that domains are absent during cooling. This absence is inconsistent with classical nucleation theory. By comparing the equilibration dynamics of our glass with that of two models with kinetic constraints, we demonstrate that dynamical facilitation generically leads to heating driven by domain growth and cooling without domains. Our results provide strong evidence that dynamical facilitation, not nucleation and interfacial-tension-driven domain growth, is the driving mechanism for the equilibration dynamics of glass-formers.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of confined water molecules in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensions and molecular structure play pivotal roles in the principle of heat conduction. The dimensional characteristics of solution within nanoscale systems depend on the degrees of confinement. However, the influence of such variations on heat transfer remains inadequately understood. Here, we perform quasi-one-dimensional non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the thermal conductivity of water molecules confined in carbon nanotubes. The structure of water molecules is determined depending on the nanotube radius, forming a single-file, a single-layer, and a double-layer structure, corresponding to an increasing radius order. We reveal that the thermal conductivity of liquid water has a sublinear dependency on nanotube length exclusively when water molecules form a single file. Stronger confinement leads to behavioral and structural characteristics closely resembling a one-dimensional nature. Moreover, single-layer-structured water molecules exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity. We elucidate that this is due to the increase in the local water density and the absence of transitions to another layer, which typically occurs in systems with double-layer water structures within relatively large radius nanotubes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kinematics of Recursive Origami Inspired by the Spidron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that the Spidron has a $1$-DOF isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of the Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit cells, we consider the folding of the Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing $1$-dimensional dynamical systems governing each of them. We show that these systems can possess different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the granular temperatures in force-free granular gases under exponential resetting. When a resetting event occurs, the granular temperature attains its initial value, whereas it decreases due to inelastic collisions between the resetting events. We study the dependence of the mean granular temperature and its variance on the resetting rate. Our theory may help to understand the behavior of non-periodically driven granular systems.</description>

      <title>A universal strategy for decoupling stiffness and extensibility of polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the invention of polymer networks in the 19th century (e.g., crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our discovery opens an avenue for developing polymer networks with extraordinary mechanical properties.</description>
