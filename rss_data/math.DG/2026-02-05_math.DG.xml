      <title>Equivariant min-max theory and the spherical Bernstein problem in $\mathbb{S}^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an embedded non-equatorial minimal hypersphere in the unit $4$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^4$, which provides a new resolution of Chern's spherical Bernstein problem in $\mathbb{S}^4$. The construction is based on our equivariant min-max theory for $G$-invariant minimal hypersurfaces with reduced genus bound, where $G$ is a compact Lie group acting by isometries on a closed Riemannian manifold with $3$-dimensional orbit space. This confirms an assertion made by Pitts-Rubinstein in 1986. We also show the regularity for the solutions of the $G$-equivariant Plateau problem and the $G$-equivariant isotopy area minimization problem.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of the Gursky-Malchiodi $Q$-curvature Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Gursky and Malchiodi introduced a non-local conformal flow in dimensions $n \geq 5$ to resolve the constant $Q$-curvature problem. They proved sequential convergence of the flow for initial metrics with positive scalar curvature and $Q$-curvature, provided the energy was sufficiently small.
  In this paper, we prove the global convergence of the flow for arbitrary initial energy under the same positivity assumptions by establishing a non-local version of the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient along the flow.
  We construct test bubbles and estimate their Paneitz-Sobolev quotients, a strategy that was carried out in the celebrated work of Brendle in the context of the Yamabe flow. We develop a more geometric and systematic proof that addresses the algebraic and computational complexity inherent in the $Q$-curvature and the Paneitz operator. Along the way, we derive a stability inequality for the Paneitz-Sobolev quotient using a higher-order Koiso-Bochner formula established in recent work of Bahuaud, Guenther, Isenberg, and Mazzeo.</description>

      <title>Hurwitz-Radon numbers and proper actions of semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study proper isometric actions of non-compact semisimple Lie groups on symmetric spaces in pseudo-Riemannian geometry. Motivated by Okuda's classification of semisimple symmetric spaces admitting proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions [J. Differ. Geom., 2013], we focus on a family of symmetric spaces lying on the "boundary case" of the existence of proper $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$-actions. As a rigidity result, we show that any connected non-compact semisimple Lie group acting properly on this family must be globally isomorphic to $Spin(n,1)$ up to compact factors. Moreover, the largest value of $n$ for the existence of $Spin(n,1)$-proper actions is governed by the Hurwitz-Radon number. Our family includes the pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic space $\mathbf{H}_{+}^{N,N-1}$ of signature $(N,N-1)$.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz Smoothing under Ricci and Injectivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a complete Riemannian manifold with a positive uniform lower bound on injectivity radius and a positive uniform lower bound on Ricci curvature admits an $L^\infty$-close (bi-Lipschitz) smooth metric with two-sided Ricci curvature bounds and a uniform positive lower bound on injectivity radius. This answers Question 2 in the Morgan--Pansu list of open problems from the conference Modern Trends in Differential Geometry (S\~ao Paulo, 2018), proposed by L. Bandara. In the proof, we rely on controlled smoothing with Croke's universal local volume lower bound and the Cheeger--Gromov--Taylor injectivity radius estimate.</description>

      <title>A Darboux classification of homogeneous Pfaffian forms on graded manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local classification problem for differential Pfaffian forms on a supermanifold $M$ that are homogeneous with respect to a given homogeneity structure on $M$. The best-known homogeneity structures are those associated with linearity on a vector bundle. The aim is to show that, for a homogeneous form of given degree, there are `Darboux coordinates' which are homogeneous. As a consequence, we obtain Darboux-type normal pictures for homogeneous forms, recovering the classical Darboux theorems, as well as their contact and presymplectic counterparts as special cases.
  To obtain an analog of Darboux's classification in the supergeometric context, we define a class of a differential form $\alpha$ by the rank of the characteristic distribution $\chi(\alpha)$, being the intersection of kernels of $\alpha$ and $d\alpha$. We show that, under suitable regularity and constant-rank assumptions, this distribution completely controls the local equivalence problem for homogeneous Pfaffian forms. Our results hold as well for ordinary (purely even) manifolds.</description>

      <title>A note on tractor bundles and codimension two spacelike immersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conformal tractor bundles from an extrinsic viewpoint, relating them to codimension two spacelike immersions into Lorentzian manifolds. We show that, at least locally, every Riemannian conformal structure admits a natural realization of its normal conformal tractor bundle as the pullback of the tangent bundle of a suitably constructed Lorentzian ambient space. Finally, we reformulate the classical equations characterizing parallel sections of the normal conformal tractor bundle in this extrinsic setting, showing that they can be expressed entirely in terms of the geometry of the associated spacelike immersion. This extrinsic perspective provides additional geometric insight into parallel standard tractors and conformal holonomy.</description>

      <title>Pairs of differential forms: a framework for precontact geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precontact manifolds extend contact geometry by weakening the maximal non-integrability condition of the defining $1$-form. We clarify the geometric foundations of this structure by studying general pairs of a $1$-form and a $2$-form under mild regularity conditions. We characterize them through their class, analyse the role of distinguished vector fields, such as Reeb or Liouville fields, and study other associated geometrical objects. Precontact structures are then treated as the special case of pairs formed by a nowhere-vanishing $1$-form and its exterior derivative. We also define Hamiltonian dynamics on precontact manifolds. Several examples are presented to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Representation Geometry as a Diagnostic for Out-of-Distribution Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust generalization under distribution shift remains difficult to monitor and optimize in the absence of target-domain labels, as models with similar in-distribution accuracy can exhibit markedly different out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. While prior work has focused on training-time regularization and low-order representation statistics, little is known about whether the geometric structure of learned embeddings provides reliable post-hoc signals of robustness. We propose a geometry-based diagnostic framework that constructs class-conditional mutual k-nearest-neighbor graphs from in-distribution embeddings and extracts two complementary invariants: a global spectral complexity proxy based on the reduced log-determinant of the normalized Laplacian, and a local smoothness measure based on Ollivier--Ricci curvature. Across multiple architectures, training regimes, and corruption benchmarks, we find that lower spectral complexity and higher mean curvature consistently predict stronger OOD accuracy across checkpoints. Controlled perturbations and topological analyses further show that these signals reflect meaningful representation structure rather than superficial embedding statistics. Our results demonstrate that representation geometry enables interpretable, label-free robustness diagnosis and supports reliable unsupervised checkpoint selection under distribution shift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the synthetic-geometric framework of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces developed in Kunzinger and S\"amann (Ann. Glob. Anal. Geom. 54(3):399--447, 2018) we introduce a notion of a hyperbolic angle, an angle between timelike curves and related concepts like timelike tangent cone and exponential map. This provides valuable technical tools for the further development of the theory and paves the way for the main result of the article, which is the characterization of timelike curvature bounds (defined via triangle comparison) with an angle monotonicity condition. Further, we improve on a geodesic non-branching result for spaces with timelike curvature bounded below.</description>

      <title>The universal structure of moment maps in complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric approach to the construction of moment maps in finite and infinite-dimensional complex geometry. We apply this to two settings: K\"ahler manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles. Our new approach exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant differential forms.
  For K\"ahler manifolds we give a new, geometric proof of Donaldson-Fujiki's moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature. Associated to arbitrary products of Chern classes of the manifold - namely to a central charge - we further introduce a geometric PDE determining a $Z$-critical K\"ahler metric, and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map properties. For holomorphic vector bundles, using a similar strategy we give a geometric proof of Atiyah-Bott's moment map interpretation of the Hermitian Yang-Mills condition. We then go on to give a new, geometric proof that the PDE determining a $Z$-critical connection - again associated to a choice of central charge - can be viewed as a moment map; deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections are a special case, in which our work gives a geometric proof of a result of Collins-Yau.
  Our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps in complex geometry - associated to any geometric problem along with a choice of stability condition - and hence that this accomplishes one of the main steps towards producing PDE counterparts to stability conditions in large generality.</description>

      <title>Fast and Stable Riemannian Metrics on SPD Manifolds via Cholesky Product Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix learning show that Riemannian metrics are fundamental to effective SPD neural networks. Motivated by this, we revisit the geometry of the Cholesky factors and uncover a simple product structure that enables convenient metric design. Building on this insight, we propose two fast and stable SPD metrics, Power--Cholesky Metric (PCM) and Bures--Wasserstein--Cholesky Metric (BWCM), derived via Cholesky decomposition. Compared with existing SPD metrics, the proposed metrics provide closed-form operators, computational efficiency, and improved numerical stability. We further apply our metrics to construct Riemannian Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifiers and residual blocks for SPD neural networks. Experiments on SPD deep learning, numerical stability analyses, and tensor interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/PCM_BWCM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the buckling and clamped-plate problems to the context of differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary. We characterize their smallest eigenvalues and prove that, in the case of bounded Euclidean domains, their spectra without multiplicities on forms coincide with the spectra of the corresponding problems on functions. We obtain various estimates involving the first eigenvalues of the mentioned problems and the ones of the Hodge Laplacian with respect to Dirichlet and absolute boundary conditions on forms. These estimates generalize previous ones in the case of functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. As a consequence, the category consisting of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces and isometries is established. With a technical condition for a definite weak Riemannian metric, we show that the pseudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic functions on geometrically finite quotients of the ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete and torsion-free subgroup of $\mathrm{PU}(n,1)$, the group of biholomorphisms of the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, denoted by $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}$. We show that if $\Gamma$ is Abelian, then $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is a Stein manifold. If the critical exponent $\delta(\Gamma)$ of $\Gamma$ is less than 2, a conjecture of Dey and Kapovich predicts that the quotient $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is Stein. We confirm this conjecture in the case where $\Gamma$ is parabolic or geometrically finite. We also study the case of quotients with $\delta(\Gamma)=2$ that contain compact complex curves and confirm another conjecture of Dey and Kapovich. We finally show that $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}/\Gamma$ is Stein when $\Gamma$ is a parabolic or geometrically finite group preserving a totally real and totally geodesic submanifold of $\mathbb{H}^{n}_{\mathbb{C}}$, without any hypothesis on the critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Fuchsian flows and the coupled vortex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow in the thermostat parametrization.</description>

      <title>Monge solutions and uniqueness in multi-marginal optimal transport with hierarchical jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Hierarchical Jump multi-marginal transport (HJMOT), a generalization of multi-marginal optimal transport where mass can "jump" over intermediate spaces via augmented isolated points. Established on Polish spaces, the framework guarantees the existence of Kantorovich solutions and, under sequential differentiability and a twist condition, the existence and uniqueness of Monge solutions. This core theory extends robustly to diverse settings, including smooth Riemannian manifolds, demonstrating its versatility as a unified framework for optimal transport across complex geometries.</description>
