      <title>Dual $F$-signatures of Veronese subrings and Segre products of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the dual $F$-signatures of certain toric rings by using combinatorial techniques. Specifically, we calculate the dual $F$-signatures of Veronese subrings of polynomial rings. Moreover, we give an upper bound for the dual $F$-signatures of Segre products of polynomial rings and show that this upper bound is attained in some cases.</description>

      <title>Matrix invertible extensions over commutative rings. Part III: Hermite rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reobtain and often refine prior criteria due to Kaplansky, McGovern, Roitman, Shchedryk, Wiegand, and Zabavsky--Bilavska and obtain new criteria for a Hermite ring to be an \textsl{EDR}. We mention three criteria: (1) a Hermite ring $R$ is an \textsl{EDR} iff for all pairs $(a,c)\in R^2$, the product homomorphism $U(R/Rac)\times U\bigl(R/Rc(1-a)\bigr)\to U(R/Rc)$ between groups of units is surjective; (2) a reduced Hermite ring is an \textsl{EDR} iff it is a pre-Schreier ring and for each $a\in R$, every zero determinant unimodular $2\times 2$ matrix with entries in $R/Ra$ lifts to a zero determinant matrix with entries in $R$; (3) a B\'{e}zout domain $R$ is an \textsl{EDD} iff for all triples $(a,b,c)\in R^3$ there exists a unimodular pair $(e,f)\in R^2$ such that $(a,e)$ and $(be+af,1-a-bc)$ are unimodular pairs. We use these criteria to show that each B\'{e}zout ring $R$ that is an $(SU)_2$ ring (as introduced by Lorenzini) such that for each nonzero $a\in R$ there exists no nontrivial self-dual projective $R/Ra$-module of rank $1$ generated by $2$ elements (e.g., all its elements are squares), is an \textsl{EDR}.</description>

      <title>Merging N-hyperideals and J-hyperideals in one frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of N-hyperideals and J-hyperideals as two classes of hyperideals were recently defined in the context of Krasner (m,n)-hyperrings. These concepts are created on the basis of the intersection of all n-ary prime hyperideals and the intersection of all maximal hyperideals, respectively. Despite being vastly different in many aspects, they shar numerous similar properties. The aim of this research work is to merge them under one frame called n-ary delta(0)-hyperideals where the function delta assigns to each hyperideals of a Krasner (m,n)-hyperring a hyperideal of the same hyperring. We give various properties of n-ary delta(0)-hyperideals and use them to characerize certain classes of hyperring such as hyperintegral domains and local hyperrings. Moreover, we introduce the notions of (s,n)-absorbing delta(0)-hyperideals and weakly (s,n)-absorbing delta(0)-hyperideals.</description>

      <title>Auslander-Reiten conjecture for modules whose (self) dual has finite complete intersection dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a commutative Noetherian ring, we show that Auslander-Reiten conjecture holds true for the class of (finitely generated) modules whose dual has finite complete intersection dimension. Our another result validates the conjecture for the class of modules whose self dual has finite complete intersection dimension and either the module or its dual has finite Gorenstein dimension.</description>

      <title>Subadditivity of shifts, Eilenberg-Zilber shuffle products and homology of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the maximal shifts in the minimal free resolution of the quotients of a polynomial ring by a monomial ideal are subadditive as a function of the homological degree. This answers a question that has received some attention in recent years. To do so, we define and study a new model for the homology of posets, given by the so called synor complex. We also introduce an Eilenberg-Zilber type shuffle product on the simplicial chain complex of lattices.
  Combining these concepts we prove that the existence of a non-zero homology class for a lattice forces certain non-zero homology classes in lower intervals. This result then translates into properties of the minimal free resolution. In particular, it implies a generalization of the original question.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic complexity of computing Gr\"obner bases of comaximal determinantal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of homogeneous linear forms over a field $\Bbbk$. If the ideal $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ generated by minors of size $n-1$ is Cohen-Macaulay, then the Gulliksen-Neg{\aa}rd complex is a free resolution of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. It has recently been shown that by taking into account the syzygy modules for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ which can be obtained from this complex, one can derive a refined signature-based Gr\"obner basis algorithm DetGB which avoids reductions to zero when computing a grevlex Gr\"obner basis for $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$. In this paper, we establish sharp complexity bounds on DetGB. To accomplish this, we prove several results on the sizes of reduced grevlex Gr\"obner bases of reverse lexicographic ideals, thanks to which we obtain two main complexity results which rely on conjectures similar to that of Fr\"oberg. The first one states that, in the zero-dimensional case, the size of the reduced grevlex Gr\"obner basis of $\mathcal{I}_{n-2}(M)$ is bounded from below by $n^{6}$ asymptotically. The second, also in the zero-dimensional case, states that the complexity of DetGB is bounded from above by $n^{2\omega+3}$ asymptotically, where $2\le\omega\le 3$ is any complexity exponent for matrix multiplication over $\Bbbk$.</description>
