      <title>The Complexity of Counting Small Sub-Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph counting is a fundamental and well-studied problem whose computational complexity is well understood. Quite surprisingly, the hypergraph version of subgraph counting has been almost ignored. In this work, we address this gap by investigating the most basic sub-hypergraph counting problem: given a (small) hypergraph $H$ and a (large) hypergraph $G$, compute the number of sub-hypergraphs of $G$ isomorphic to $H$. Formally, for a family $\mathcal{H}$ of hypergraphs, let #Sub($\mathcal{H}$) be the restriction of the problem to $H \in \mathcal{H}$; the induced variant #IndSub($\mathcal{H}$) is defined analogously. Our main contribution is a complete classification of the complexity of these problems. Assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, we prove that #Sub($\mathcal{H}$) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\mathcal{H}$ has bounded fractional co-independent edge-cover number, a novel graph parameter we introduce. Moreover, #IndSub($\mathcal{H}$) is fixed-parameter tractable if and only if $\mathcal{H}$ has bounded fractional edge-cover number. Both results subsume pre-existing results for graphs as special cases. We also show that the fixed-parameter tractable cases of #Sub($\mathcal{H}$) and #IndSub($\mathcal{H}$) are unlikely to be in polynomial time, unless respectively #P = P and Graph Isomorphism $\in$ P. This shows a separation with the special case of graphs, where the fixed-parameter tractable cases are known to actually be in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Linear Planar 3-SAT and Its Applications in Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several fragments of the satisfiability problem have been studied in the literature. Among these, Linear 3-SAT is a satisfaction problem in which each clause (viewed as a set of literals) intersects with at most one other clause; moreover, any pair of clauses have at most one literal in common. Planar 3-SAT is a fragment which requires that the so-called variable-clause graph is planar. Both fragments are NP-complete and have applications in encoding NP-hard planning problems. In this paper, we investigate the complexity and applications of the fragment obtained combining both features. We define Linear Planar 3-SAT and prove its NP-completeness. We also study the reconfiguration problem of Linear Planar 3-SAT and show that it is PSPACE-complete. As an application, we use these new results to prove the NP-completeness of Bounded Connected Multi-Agent Pathfinding and the PSPACE-completeness of Connected Multi-Agent Pathfinding in two-dimensional grids.</description>

      <title>Generating uniform linear extensions using few random bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{linear extension} of a partial order \(\preceq\) over items \(A = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, n \}\) is a permutation \(\sigma\) such that for all \(i &lt; j\) in \(A\), it holds that \(\neg(\sigma(j) \preceq \sigma(i))\). Consider the problem of generating uniformly from the set of linear extensions of a partial order. The best method currently known uses \(O(n^3 \ln(n))\) operations and \(O(n^3 \ln(n)^2)\) iid fair random bits to generate such a permutation. This paper presents a method that generates a uniform linear extension using only \(2.75 n^3 \ln(n)\) operations and \( 1.83 n^3 \ln(n) \) iid fair bits on average.</description>

      <title>Information-Computation Gaps in Quantum Learning via Low-Degree Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data, designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.</description>
