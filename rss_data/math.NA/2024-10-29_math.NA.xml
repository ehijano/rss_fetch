      <title>Hierarchical Network Partitioning for Solution of Potential-Driven, Steady-State Nonlinear Network Flow Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential-driven steady-state flow in networks is an abstract problem which manifests in various engineering applications, such as transport of natural gas, water, electric power through infrastructure networks or flow through fractured rocks modelled as discrete fracture networks. In general, while the problem is simple when restricted to a single edge of a network, it ceases to be so for a large network.
  The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology and in general there is no numerical algorithm that offers guaranteed convergence to the solution (assuming a solution exists). Some methods offer guarantees in cases where the network topology satisfies certain assumptions but these methods fail for larger networks. On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson algorithm offers a convergence guarantee if the starting point lies close to the (unknown) solution.
  It would be advantageous to compute the solution of the large nonlinear system through the solution of smaller nonlinear sub-systems wherein the solution algorithms (Newton-Raphson or otherwise) are more likely to succeed. This article proposes and describes such a procedure, an hierarchical network partitioning algorithm that enables the solution of large nonlinear systems corresponding to potential-driven steady-state network flow equations.</description>

      <title>A quantum graph FFT with applications to partial differential equations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural and manufactured structures can be effectively modeled as networks of one dimensional segments joined at nodes. A new algorithm for the numerical solution of various time dependent partial differential equations on some of these networks is presented. The main novelty is a network version of the Fast Fourier Transform, which provides an efficient technique for expansions with eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator.</description>

      <title>Studying Morphological Variation: Exploring the Shape Space in Evolutionary Anthropology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of a long-term team collaboration of mathematicians and biologists. We focus on building a mathematical framework for the shape space constituted by a collection of homologous bones or teeth from many species. The biological application is to quantitative morphological understanding of the evolutionary history of primates in particular, and mammals more generally. Similar to the practice of biologists, we leverage the power of the whole collection for results that are more robust than can be obtained by only pairwise comparisons, using tools from differential geometry and machine learning. This paper concentrates on the mathematical framework. We review methods for comparing anatomical surfaces, discuss the problem of registration and alignment, and address the computation of different distances. Next, we cover broader questions related to cross-dataset landmark selection, shape segmentation, and shape classification analysis. This paper summarizes the work of many team members other than the authors; in this paper that unites (for the first time) all their results in one joint context, space restrictions prevent a full description of the mathematical details, which are thoroughly covered in the original articles. Although our application is to the study of anatomical surfaces, we believe our approach has much wider applicability.</description>

      <title>On the adaptive deterministic block coordinate descent methods with momentum for solving large linear least-squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first present an adaptive deterministic block coordinate descent method with momentum (mADBCD) to solve the linear least-squares problem, which is based on Polyak's heavy ball method and a new column selection criterion for a set of block-controlled indices defined by the Euclidean norm of the residual vector of the normal equation. The mADBCD method eliminates the need for pre-partitioning the column indexes of the coefficient matrix, and it also obviates the need to compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a column sub-matrix at each iteration. Moreover, we demonstrate the adaptability and flexibility in the automatic selection and updating of the block control index set. When the coefficient matrix has full rank, the theoretical analysis of the mADBCD method indicates that it linearly converges towards the unique solution of the linear least-squares problem. Furthermore, by effectively integrating count sketch technology with the mADBCD method, we also propose a novel count sketch adaptive block coordinate descent method with momentum (CS-mADBCD) for solving highly overdetermined linear least-squares problems and analysis its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of the proposed two methods in terms of both CPU times and iteration counts compared to recent block coordinate descent methods.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Numerical Scheme for a Time-Fractional Burgers Equation with Caputo-Prabhakar Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical method to solve a time-fractional Burgers equation, achieving order of convergence $(2-\alpha)$ in time, here $\alpha$ represents the order of the time derivative. The fractional derivative is modeled by Caputo-Prabhakar (CP) formulation, which incorporates a kernel defined by the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler function. Finite difference methods are employed for the discretization of the derivatives. To handle the non-linear term, the Newton iteration method is used. The proposed numerical scheme is proven to be stable and convergent in the $L_{\infty}$ norm. The validity of the theory is supported by two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Tangential-Normal Decompositions of Finite Element Differential Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a novel tangential-normal ($t$-$n$) decomposition for finite element differential forms. Its main contribution is the development of a $t$-$n$ basis where the degrees of freedom and shape functions are explicitly dual to each other. This duality simplifies the assembly of stiffness matrices and enhances the efficiency of interpolation and numerical integration in finite element methods. Additionally, the well-documented Lagrange element basis can be used to expedite implementation. This paper focuses on the full polynomial spaces, excluding trimmed polynomial differential forms, and provides a new perspective on constructing finite element differential forms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Weak Galerkin Finite Element Methods for Maxwell Equations on polyhedral Meshes without Convexity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method with reduced stabilizers for solving the time-harmonic Maxwell equations on both convex and non-convex polyhedral meshes. By employing bubble functions as a critical analytical tool, the proposed method enhances efficiency by partially eliminating the stabilizers traditionally used in WG methods. This streamlined WG method demonstrates stability and effectiveness on convex and non-convex polyhedral meshes, representing a significant improvement over existing stabilizer-free WG methods, which are typically limited to convex elements within finite element partitions. The method achieves an optimal error estimate for the exact solution in a discrete $H^1$ norm, and additionally, an optimal $L^2$ error estimate is established for the WG solution. Several numerical experiments are conducted to validate the method's efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Energy Stable and Well-balanced Scheme for the Ripa System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and analyse an energy stable, structure preserving and well-balanced scheme for the Ripa system of shallow water equations. The energy stability of the numerical solutions is achieved by introducing appropriate stabilisation terms in the discretisation of the convective fluxes of mass and momenta, the pressure gradient and the topography source term. A diligent choice of the interface values of the water height and the temperature ensures the well-balancing property of the scheme for three physically relevant hydrostatic steady states. The explicit in time and finite volume in space scheme preserves the positivity of the water height and the temperature, and it is weakly consistent with the continuous model equations in the sense of Lax-Wendroff. The results of extensive numerical case studies on benchmark test problems are presented to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Implicit-explicit time discretization schemes for a class of semilinear wave equations with nonautonomous dampings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned about the implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods for a class of dissipative wave systems with time-varying velocity feedbacks and nonlinear potential energies, equipped with different boundary conditions. Firstly, we approximate the problems by using a vanilla IMEX method, which is a second-order scheme for the problems when the damping terms are time-independent. However, rigors analysis shows that the error rate declines from second to first order due to the nonautonomous dampings. To recover the convergence order, we propose a revised IMEX scheme and apply it to the nonautonomous wave equations with a kinetic boundary condition. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the revised scheme can not only achieve second-order accuracy but also improve the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose numerical schemes for the approximate solution of problems defined on the edges of a one-dimensional graph. In particular, we consider linear transport and a drift-diffusion equations, and discretize them by extending Finite Volume schemes with upwind flux to domains presenting bifurcation nodes with an arbitrary number of incoming and outgoing edges, and implicit time discretization. We show that the discrete problems admit positive unique solutions, and we test the methods on the intricate geometry of an electrical treeing.</description>

      <title>A new class of splitting methods that preserve ergodicity and exponential integrability for stochastic Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of splitting methods to solve the stochastic Langevin equation, which can simultaneously preserve the ergodicity and exponential integrability of the original equation. The central idea is to extract a stochastic subsystem that possesses the strict dissipation from the original equation, which is inspired by the inheritance of the Lyapunov structure for obtaining the ergodicity. We prove that the exponential moment of the numerical solution is bounded, thus validating the exponential integrability of the proposed methods. Further, we show that under moderate verifiable conditions, the methods have the first-order convergence in both strong and weak senses, and we present several concrete splitting schemes based on the methods. The splitting strategy of methods can be readily extended to construct conformal symplectic methods and high-order methods that preserve both the ergodicity and the exponential integrability, as demonstrated in numerical experiments. Our numerical experiments also show that the proposed methods have good performance in the long-time simulation.</description>

      <title>Edge multiscale finite element methods for semilinear parabolic problems with heterogeneous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new spatial semidiscrete multiscale method based upon the edge multiscale methods to solve semilinear parabolic problems with heterogeneous coefficients and smooth initial data. This method allows for a cheap spatial discretization, which fails to resolve the spatial heterogeneity but maintains satisfactory accuracy independent of the heterogeneity. This is achieved by simultaneously constructing a steady-state multiscale ansatz space with certain approximation properties for the evolving solution and the initial data. The approximation properties of the multiscale ansatz space are derived using local-global splitting. A fully discrete scheme is analyzed using a first-order explicit exponential Euler scheme. We derive the error estimates in the $L^{2}$-norm and energy norm under the regularity assumptions for the semilinear term. The convergence rates depend on the coarse grid size and the level parameter. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seam carving, a content-aware image resizing technique, has garnered significant attention for its ability to resize images while preserving important content. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of four algorithmic design techniques for seam carving: brute-force, greedy, dynamic programming, and GPU-based parallel algorithms. We begin by presenting a theoretical overview of each technique, discussing their underlying principles and computational complexities. Subsequently, we delve into empirical evaluations, comparing the performance of these algorithms in terms of runtime efficiency. Our experimental results provide insights into the theoretical complexities of the design techniques.</description>

      <title>Symmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on dual quaternion algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, we have seen that dual quaternion algorithms are used in 3D coordinate transformation problems due to their advantages. 3D coordinate transformation problem is one of the important problems in geodesy. This transformation problem is encountered in many application areas other than geodesy. Although there are many coordinate transformation methods (similarity, affine, projective, etc.), similarity transformation is used because of its simplicity. The asymmetric transformation is preferred to the symmetric coordinate transformation because of its ease of use. In terms of error theory, the symmetric transformation should be preferred. In this study, the topic of symmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on the dual quaternion algorithm is discussed, and the bottlenecks encountered in solving the problem and the solution method are discussed. A new iterative algorithm based on the dual quaternion is presented. The solution is implemented in two different models: with constraint equations and without constraint equations. The advantages and disadvantages of the two models compared to each other are also evaluated. Not only the transformation parameters but also the errors of the transformation parameters are determined. The detailed derivation of the formulas for estimating the symmetric similarity of 3D transformation parameters is presented step by step. Since symmetric transformation is the general form of asymmetric transformation, we can also obtain asymmetric transformation results with a simple modification of the model we developed for symmetric transformation. The proposed algorithm is capable of performing both 2D and 3D symmetric and asymmetric similarity transformations. For the 2D transformation, it is sufficient to replace the z and Z coordinates in both systems with zero.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter spaces of big data and AI applications. Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $O(h^2 d^{1/2})$ in dimension $d&gt;0$ with stepsize $h&gt;0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration, thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize. We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training and stochastic weight averaging.</description>

      <title>Predicting potato plant vigor from the seed tuber properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vigor of potato plants, defined as the canopy area at the end of the exponential growth stage, depends on the origin and physiological state of the seed tuber. Experiments carried out with six potato varieties in three test fields over three years show that there is a 73%-90% correlation in the vigor of the plants from the same seedlot grown in different test fields. However, these correlations are not always observed on the level of individual varieties and vanish or become negative when the seed tubers and young plants experience environmental stress. A comprehensive study of the association between the vigor and the seed tuber biochemistry has revealed that, while 50%-70% of the variation in the plant vigor is explained by the tuber data, the vigor is dominated by the potato genotype. Analysis of individual predictors, such as the abundance of a particular metabolite, indicates that the vigor enhancing properties of the seed tubers differ between genotypes. Variety-specific models show that, for some varieties, up to 30% of the vigor variation within the variety is explained by and can be predicted from the tuber biochemistry, whereas, for other varieties, the association between the tuber composition and the vigor is much weaker.</description>

      <title>XbarSim: A Decomposition-Based Memristive Crossbar Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the growing focus on memristive crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) architectures as a potential alternative to current energy-hungry machine learning hardware, the availability of a fast and accurate circuit-level simulation framework could greatly enhance research and development efforts in this field. This paper introduces XbarSim, a domain-specific circuit-level simulator designed to analyze the nodal equations of memristive crossbars. The first version of XbarSim, proposed herein, leverages the lower-upper (LU) decomposition approach to solve the nodal equations for the matrices associated with crossbars. The XbarSim is capable of simulating interconnect parasitics within crossbars and supports batch processing of the inputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that the XbarSim can achieve orders of magnitude speedup compared to HSPICE across various sizes of memristive crossbars. The XbarSim's full suite of features is accessible to researchers as an open-source tool.</description>

      <title>Crack opening calculation in phase-field modeling of fluid-filled fracture: A robust and efficient strain-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase-field method has become popular for the numerical modeling of fluid-filled fractures, thanks to its ability to represent complex fracture geometry without algorithms. However, the algorithm-free representation of fracture geometry poses a significant challenge in calculating the crack opening (aperture) of phase-field fracture, which governs the fracture permeability and hence the overall hydromechanical behavior. Although several approaches have been devised to compute the crack opening of phase-field fracture, they require a sophisticated algorithm for post-processing the phase-field values or an additional parameter sensitive to the element size and alignment. Here, we develop a novel method for calculating the crack opening of fluid-filled phase-field fracture, which enables one to obtain the crack opening without additional algorithms or parameters. We transform the displacement-jump-based kinematics of a fracture into a continuous strain-based version, insert it into a force balance equation on the fracture, and apply the phase-field approximation. Through this procedure, we obtain a simple equation for the crack opening, which can be calculated with quantities at individual material points. We verify the proposed method with analytical and numerical solutions obtained based on discrete representations of fractures, demonstrating its capability to calculate the crack opening regardless of the element size or alignment.</description>

      <title>Latent Neural Operator Pretraining for Solving Time-Dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretraining methods gain increasing attraction recently for solving PDEs with neural operators. It alleviates the data scarcity problem encountered by neural operator learning when solving single PDE via training on large-scale datasets consisting of various PDEs and utilizing shared patterns among different PDEs to improve the solution precision. In this work, we propose the Latent Neural Operator Pretraining (LNOP) framework based on the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) backbone. We achieve universal transformation through pretraining on hybrid time-dependent PDE dataset to extract representations of different physical systems and solve various time-dependent PDEs in the latent space through finetuning on single PDE dataset. Our proposed LNOP framework reduces the solution error by 31.7% on four problems and can be further improved to 57.1% after finetuning. On out-of-distribution dataset, our LNOP model achieves roughly 50% lower error and 3$\times$ data efficiency on average across different dataset sizes. These results show that our method is more competitive in terms of solution precision, transfer capability and data efficiency compared to non-pretrained neural operators.</description>

      <title>Low-rank Bayesian matrix completion via geodesic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new sampling-based approach for enabling efficient computation of low-rank Bayesian matrix completion and quantifying the associated uncertainty. Firstly, we design a new prior model based on the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) parametrization of low-rank matrices. Our prior is analogous to the seminal nuclear-norm regularization used in non-Bayesian setting and enforces orthogonality in the factor matrices by constraining them to Stiefel manifolds. Then, we design a geodesic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (-within-Gibbs) algorithm for generating posterior samples of the SVD factor matrices. We demonstrate that our approach resolves the sampling difficulties encountered by standard Gibbs samplers for the common two-matrix factorization used in matrix completion. More importantly, the geodesic Hamiltonian sampler allows for sampling in cases with more general likelihoods than the typical Gaussian likelihood and Gaussian prior assumptions adopted in most of the existing Bayesian matrix completion literature. We demonstrate an applications of our approach to fit the categorical data of a mice protein dataset and the MovieLens recommendation problem. Numerical examples demonstrate superior sampling performance, including better mixing and faster convergence to a stationary distribution. Moreover, they demonstrate improved accuracy on the two real-world benchmark problems we considered.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vectorvalued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the phase field. In the presence of non-normality, the spectral analysis of such a matrix when (unknown or uncertain or time-dependent) constitutive parameters vary is generically not decisive to evaluate the material stability. We thus need to look at the pseudospectrum, that is, the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in an {\epsilon}-neighborhood of the matrix of interest. As a case study, we look at quasicrystals and evaluate through spectra and pseudospectra the influence of a microstructural self-action on the material stability. This approach allows us to reliably determine thresholds where stable-unstable transitions in the material behavior occur.</description>

      <title>Contributions to the Algorithmic Foundations of Approximate Lie Symmetry Algebras of Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lie symmetry transformations that leave a differential equation invariant play a fundamental role in science and mathematics. Such Lie symmetry groups uniquely determine their Lie symmetry algebras. Exact differential elimination algorithms have been developed to determine the dimension and structure constants of the Lie symmetry algebra of an exact polynomially nonlinear differential equation. Directly applying these symbolic algorithms to approximate models is prone to instability since these algorithms strongly depend on the orderings of the variables involved. This motivates the need to address questions at the algorithmic foundation of approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations. How do we define approximate Lie symmetry? How do we compute and apply approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations? How reliable are the results?
  To address such questions, we define approximate Lie symmetry algebras in terms of exact Lie symmetry algebras of a nearby differential equation. Our algorithm for identifying these hidden approximate Lie symmetry algebras uses the SVD to find nearby rank-deficient systems combined with approximate geometric involutive forms of the approximate symmetry-defining systems. Our approach is local and depends on an input base point in the space of independent and dependent variables. In general, our local approach can yield many different nearby Lie symmetry algebras. We also outline a numerical approach to determining the approximate isomorphic of such Lie symmetry algebras as the local base point varies across a grid in the base space. We also provide a method for evaluating the reliability of our results. This enables the base space to be partitioned into regions where different local Lie symmetry algebras are admitted, separated by unstable transition regions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering culprits for cyanobacterial blooms and lake vulnerability in north-temperate lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) have a growing global prevalence, emerging as a significant environmental concern due to their potential toxicity. Understanding how the different mechanisms affect CBs is crucial to develop actionable management strategies. For this, we derive a stoichiometric dynamical system that describes the qualitative population dynamics of cyanobacteria and their toxicity in north-temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our model quantifies the hypoxic effects of CBs on fish mortality and the effect of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a potent toxin produced by cyanobacteria, on aquatic macro-invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish species. By fitting the model to lakes with varying physical characteristics, eutrophic conditions, and water temperature, we can delineate and understand the driving components of CBs. We show that decreases in water exchange rate, depth of epilimnion, or light attenuation increases bloom intensity and duration. Furthermore, our models concur that eutrophication and increasing water temperatures exacerbate the intensity of CBs. We observe a severe bioaccumulative effect of MC-LR in aquatic species, stressing the potential impact on humans and other terrestrial animals. We validate our model with field measurements demonstrating its applicability to several realistic lake conditions. These insights are essential for informing targeted interventions to reduce CBs and their ecological impacts.</description>

      <title>On the longest increasing subsequence and number of cycles of butterfly permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a square matrix $A$, Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) results in the factorization $PA = LU$ where $L$ and $U$ are lower and upper triangular matrices and $P$ is a permutation matrix. If $A$ is a random matrix, then the associated permutation from the $P$ factor is random. We are interested in studying properties of random permutations generated using GEPP. We introduce and present probabilistic results for groups of simple and nonsimple butterfly permutations of order $N = p^n$ for prime $p$, on which GEPP induces the Haar measure when applied to particular ensembles of random butterfly matrices. Of note, the nonsimple butterfly permutations include specific $p$-Sylow subgroups of $S_{p^n}$ for each prime $p$. Moreover, we focus on addressing the questions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the number of cycles for butterfly permutations. Our proof techniques utilize the explicit structural recursive properties of these permutations to answer what are traditionally hard analytical questions using simpler tools. For simple butterfly permutations, we provide full distributional descriptions and Law of Large Numbers (LLN) or Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type results for each statistic. For nonsimple $p$-nary butterfly permutations, we establish lower and upper power law bounds on the expected LIS of the form $N^{\alpha_p}$ and $N^{\beta_p}$ where $\frac12 &lt; \alpha_p &lt; \beta_p &lt; 1$ for each $p$ with $\alpha_p = 1 - o_p(1)$. Additionally, we determine the aysmptotic form for the number of cycles scaled by $(2 - \frac1p)^n$ that limit to new distributions we introduce depending only on $p$ whose positive integer moments satisfy explicit recursion formulas for each $p$; in particular, this characterizes a full CLT result for the number of cycles for any uniform $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_{p^n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper offers a contemporary and comprehensive perspective on the classical algorithms utilized for the solution of minimum-time problem for linear systems (MTPLS). The use of unified notations supported by visual geometric representations serves to highlight the differences between the Neustadt-Eaton and Barr-Gilbert algorithms. Furthermore, these notations assist in the interpretation of the distance-finding algorithms utilized in the Barr-Gilbert algorithm. Additionally, we present a novel algorithm for solving MTPLS and provide a constructive proof of its convergence. Similar to the Barr-Gilbert algorithm, the novel algorithm employs distance search algorithms. The design of the novel algorithm is oriented towards solving such MTPLS for which the analytic description of the reachable set is available. To illustrate the advantages of the novel algorithm, we utilize the isotropic rocket benchmark. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, for high-precision computations, the novel algorithm outperforms others by factors of tens or hundreds and exhibits the lowest failure rate.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the convergence of the primal-dual algorithm for composite optimization problems when the objective functions are weakly convex. We introduce a modified duality gap function, which is a lower bound of the standard duality gap function. Under the sharpness condition of this new function, we identify the area around the set of saddle points where we obtain the convergence of the primal-dual algorithm. We give numerical examples and applications in image denoising and deblurring to demonstrate our results.</description>

      <title>Computable Lipschitz Bounds for Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving sharp and computable upper bounds of the Lipschitz constant of deep neural networks is crucial to formally guarantee the robustness of neural-network based models. We analyse three existing upper bounds written for the $l^2$ norm. We highlight the importance of working with the $l^1$ and $l^\infty$ norms and we propose two novel bounds for both feed-forward fully-connected neural networks and convolutional neural networks. We treat the technical difficulties related to convolutional neural networks with two different methods, called explicit and implicit. Several numerical tests empirically confirm the theoretical results, help to quantify the relationship between the presented bounds and establish the better accuracy of the new bounds. Four numerical tests are studied: two where the output is derived from an analytical closed form are proposed; another one with random matrices; and the last one for convolutional neural networks trained on the MNIST dataset. We observe that one of our bound is optimal in the sense that it is exact for the first test with the simplest analytical form and it is better than other bounds for the other tests.</description>

      <title>LAMA: Stable Dual-Domain Deep Reconstruction For Sparse-View CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems arise in many applications, especially tomographic imaging. We develop a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) to solve such problems via two-block optimization by synergizing data-driven and classical techniques with proven convergence. LAMA is naturally induced by a variational model with learnable regularizers in both data and image domains, parameterized as composite functions of neural networks trained with domain-specific data. We allow these regularizers to be nonconvex and nonsmooth to extract features from data effectively. We minimize the overall objective function using Nesterov's smoothing technique and residual learning architecture. It is demonstrated that LAMA reduces network complexity, improves memory efficiency, and enhances reconstruction accuracy, stability, and interpretability.

      <title>Benchmarking Numerical Algorithms for Harmonic Maps into the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark methods for computing harmonic maps into the unit sphere, with particular focus on harmonic maps with singularities. For the discretization we compare two different approaches, both based on Lagrange finite elements. While the first method enforces the unit-length constraint only at the Lagrange nodes, the other one adds a pointwise projection to fulfill the constraint everywhere. For the solution of the resulting algebraic problems we compare a nonconforming gradient flow with a Riemannian trust-region method. Both are energy-decreasing and can be shown to converge globally to stationary points of the discretized Dirichlet energy. We observe that while the nonconforming and the conforming discretizations both show similar behavior for smooth problems, the nonconforming discretization handles singularities better. On the solver side, the second-order trust-region method converges after few steps, whereas the number of gradient-flow steps increases proportionally to the inverse grid element diameter.</description>

      <title>When data driven reduced order modeling meets full waveform inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waveform inversion is concerned with estimating a heterogeneous medium, modeled by variable coefficients of wave equations, using sources that emit probing signals and receivers that record the generated waves. It is an old and intensively studied inverse problem with a wide range of applications, but the existing inversion methodologies are still far from satisfactory. The typical mathematical formulation is a nonlinear least squares data fit optimization and the difficulty stems from the non-convexity of the objective function that displays numerous local minima at which local optimization approaches stagnate. This pathological behavior has at least three unavoidable causes: (1) The mapping from the unknown coefficients to the wave field is nonlinear and complicated. (2) The sources and receivers typically lie on a single side of the medium, so only backscattered waves are measured. (3) The probing signals are band limited and with high frequency content. There is a lot of activity in the computational science and engineering communities that seeks to mitigate the difficulty of estimating the medium by data fitting. In this paper we present a different point of view, based on reduced order models (ROMs) of two operators that control the wave propagation. The ROMs are called data driven because they are computed directly from the measurements, without any knowledge of the wave field inside the inaccessible medium. This computation is non-iterative and uses standard numerical linear algebra methods. The resulting ROMs capture features of the physics of wave propagation in a complementary way and have surprisingly good approximation properties that facilitate waveform inversion.
  In this arxiv version two important typos are corrected when compared to the published version. The typo was in the second equation in Theorem 3 and carried over into Corollary 1. The proofs are correct.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present convergence estimates of two types of greedy algorithms in terms of the metric entropy of underlying compact sets. In the first part, we measure the error of a standard greedy reduced basis method for parametric PDEs by the metric entropy of the solution manifold in Banach spaces. This contrasts with the classical analysis based on the Kolmogorov n-widths and enables us to obtain direct comparisons between the greedy algorithm error and the entropy numbers, where the multiplicative constants are explicit and simple. The entropy-based convergence estimate is sharp and improves upon the classical width-based analysis of reduced basis methods for elliptic model problems. In the second part, we derive a novel and simple convergence analysis of the classical orthogonal greedy algorithm for nonlinear dictionary approximation using the metric entropy of the symmetric convex hull of the dictionary. This also improves upon existing results by giving a direct comparison between the algorithm error and the metric entropy.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a simple initialization of the Maubach bisection routine for adaptive mesh refinement which applies to any conforming initial triangulation and terminates in linear time with respect to the number of initial vertices. We show that Maubach's routine with this initialization generates meshes that preserve shape regularity and satisfy the closure estimate needed for optimal convergence of adaptive schemes. Our ansatz allows for the intrinsic use of existing implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to address two issues of integral equations for the scattering of time-harmonic electromagnetic waves by a perfect electric conductor with Lipschitz continuous boundary: ill-conditioned {boundary element Galerkin matrices} on fine meshes and instability at spurious resonant frequencies. The remedy to ill-conditioned matrices is operator preconditioning, and resonant instability is eliminated by means of a combined field integral equation. Exterior traces of single and double layer potentials are complemented by their interior counterparts for a purely imaginary wave number. We derive the corresponding variational formulation in the natural trace space for electromagnetic fields and establish its well-posedness for all wave numbers. A Galerkin discretization scheme is employed using conforming edge boundary elements on dual meshes, which produces well-conditioned discrete linear systems of the variational formulation. Some numerical results are also provided to support the numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast and Inverse-Free Algorithms for Deflating Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a key question in numerical linear algebra: how can we compute projectors onto the deflating subspaces of a regular matrix pencil $(A,B)$, in particular without using matrix inversion or defaulting to an expensive Schur decomposition? We focus specifically on spectral projectors, whose associated deflating subspaces correspond to sets of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. In this work, we present a high-level approach to computing these projectors, which combines rational function approximation with an inverse-free arithmetic of Benner and Byers [Numerische Mathematik 2006]. The result is a numerical framework that captures existing inverse-free methods, generates an array of new options, and provides straightforward tools for pursuing efficiency on structured problems (e.g., definite pencils). To exhibit the efficacy of this framework, we consider a handful of methods in detail, including Implicit Repeated Squaring and iterations based on the matrix sign function. For the former, we present a new and general floating-point stability bound that may be of independent interest. In an appendix, we demonstrate that recent, randomized divide-and-conquer eigensolvers -- which are built on fast methods for individual projectors like those considered here -- can be adapted to produce the generalized Schur form of any matrix pencil in nearly matrix multiplication time.</description>

      <title>Strongly stable dual-pairing summation by parts finite difference schemes for the vector invariant nonlinear shallow water equations -- I: Numerical scheme and validation on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an energy/entropy stable and high order accurate finite difference (FD) method for solving the nonlinear (rotating) shallow water equations (SWEs) in vector invariant form using the newly developed dual-pairing and dispersion-relation preserving summation by parts (SBP) FD operators. We derive new well-posed boundary conditions (BCs) for the SWE in one space dimension, formulated in terms of fluxes and applicable to linear and nonlinear SWEs. For the nonlinear vector invariant SWE in the subcritical regime, where energy is an entropy functional, we find that energy/entropy stability ensures the boundedness of numerical solution but does not guarantee convergence. Adequate amount of numerical dissipation is necessary to control high frequency errors which could negatively impact accuracy in the numerical simulations. Using the dual-pairing SBP framework, we derive high order accurate and nonlinear hyper-viscosity operator which dissipates entropy and enstrophy. The hyper-viscosity operator effectively minimises oscillations from shocks and discontinuities, and eliminates high frequency grid-scale errors. The numerical method is most suitable for the simulations of subcritical flows typically observed in atmospheric and geostrophic flow problems. We prove both nonlinear and local linear stability results, as well as a priori error estimates for the semi-discrete approximations of both linear and nonlinear SWEs. Convergence, accuracy, and well-balanced properties are verified via the method of manufactured solutions and canonical test problems such as the dam break and lake at rest. Numerical simulations in two-dimensions are presented which include the rotating and merging vortex problem and barotropic shear instability, with fully developed turbulence.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical solution of fractional terminal value problems (FDE-TVPs). In particular, the proposed procedure uses a Newton-type iteration which is particularly efficient when coupled with a recently-introduced step-by-step procedure for solving fractional initial value problems (FDE-IVPs), able to produce spectrally accurate solutions of FDE problems. Some numerical tests are reported to make evidence of its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Volume-Preserving Transformers for Learning Time Series Data with Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the many trends in neural network research of the past few years have been (i) the learning of dynamical systems, especially with recurrent neural networks such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and (ii) the introduction of transformer neural networks for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
  While some work has been performed on the intersection of these two trends, those efforts were largely limited to using the vanilla transformer directly without adjusting its architecture for the setting of a physical system.
  In this work we develop a transformer-inspired neural network and use it to learn a dynamical system. We (for the first time) change the activation function of the attention layer to imbue the transformer with structure-preserving properties to improve long-term stability. This is shown to be of great advantage when applying the neural network to learning the trajectory of a rigid body.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for systems of nonlocal balance laws modeling dense multilane vehicular traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled system of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution is proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, as opposed to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., drad101, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is also indicated. Numerical simulations illustrating the theory and the behavior of the entropy solution as the support of the kernel goes to zero (nonlocal to local limit), are shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a provably convergent kernel-based solver for path-dependent PDEs (PPDEs). Our numerical scheme leverages signature kernels, a recently introduced class of kernels on path-space. Specifically, we solve an optimal recovery problem by approximating the solution of a PPDE with an element of minimal norm in the signature reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) constrained to satisfy the PPDE at a finite collection of collocation paths. In the linear case, we show that the optimisation has a unique closed-form solution expressed in terms of signature kernel evaluations at the collocation paths. We prove consistency of the proposed scheme, guaranteeing convergence to the PPDE solution as the number of collocation points increases. Finally, several numerical examples are presented, in particular in the context of option pricing under rough volatility. Our numerical scheme constitutes a valid alternative to the ubiquitous Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular scale decision making is modulated by the dynamics of signalling molecules and their diffusive trajectories from a source to small absorbing sites on the cellular surface. Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of works on weak convergence of one-step schemes for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with one-sided Lipschitz conditions. It is known that the super-linear coefficients may lead to a blowup of moments of solutions and numerical solutions and thus affect the convergence of numerical methods. Wang et al. (2023, IMA J. Numer. Anal.) have analyzed weak convergence of one-step numerical schemes when solutions to SDEs have all finite moments. Therein some modified Euler schemes have been discussed about their weak convergence orders. In this work, we explore the effects of limited orders of moments on the weak convergence of a family of explicit schemes. The schemes are based on approximations/modifications of terms in the Ito-Talyor expansion. We provide a systematic but simple way to establish weak convergence orders for these schemes. We present several numerical examples of these schemes and show their weak convergence orders.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative complex variable solution on sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential excavation is common in shallow tunnel engineering, especially for large-span tunnels. However, existing complex variable solutions can not handle sequential shallow tunnelling effectively. This paper proposes a new complex variable solution on sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial with reasonable far-field displacement in a non-iterative manner by incorporating a bidirectional stepwise conformal mapping combining Charge Simulation Method and Complex Dipole Simulation Method. The non-iterative manner ensures that the mechanical models of sequential excavation stages share similar mathematical formation with non-successive mixed boundary conditions, which are respectively transformed into corresponding homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problems, and are solved to obtain stress and displacement fields of sequential shallow tunnelling. The proposed solution is subsequently validated by sufficient comparisons with equivalent finite element solution with good agreements. The comparisons also suggest that the proposed solution should be more accurate than the finite element one. A parametric investigation is finally conducted to illustrate possible practical applications of the proposed solution with several engineering recommendations. Additionally, the theoretical improvements and defects of the proposed solution are discussed for objectivity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J. Math. Phys. 11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Subspace Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Travel-Time Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely studied as effective generative tools for solving inverse problems. The main ideas focus on performing the reverse sampling process conditioned on noisy measurements, using well-established numerical solvers for gradient updates. Although diffusion-based sampling methods can produce high-quality reconstructions, challenges persist in nonlinear PDE-based inverse problems and sampling speed. In this work, we explore solving PDE-based travel-time tomography based on subspace diffusion generative models. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose a posterior sampling process for PDE-based inverse problems by solving the associated adjoint-state equation. Second, we resorted to the subspace-based dimension reduction technique for conditional sampling acceleration, enabling solving the PDE-based inverse problems from coarse to refined grids. Our numerical experiments showed satisfactory advancements in improving the travel-time imaging quality and reducing the sampling time for reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of the Euler's method for stochastic differential equations with multiplicative noise via relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sharp error estimate of the density under the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) for the traditional Euler-Maruyama discretization of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with multiplicative noise. The foundation of the proof is the estimates of the derivatives for the logarithmic numerical density. The key technique is to adopt the Malliavin calculus to get the expressions of the derivatives of the logarithmic Green's function and to obtain an estimate for the inverse Malliavin matrix. The estimate of relative entropy then naturally gives sharp error bounds under total variation distance and Wasserstein distances. Compared to the usual weak error estimate for SDEs, such estimate can give an error bound for a family of test functions instead of one test function.</description>

      <title>A novel polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method solving three-dimensional heat conduction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derived the three-dimensional scaled boundary finite element formulation for thermal conduction problems. By introducing Wachspress shape functions, we proposed a novel polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method (PSBFEM) to address thermal conduction problems. The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges associated with complex geometries by integrating the polyhedral mesh and the octree mesh. The presented formulation handles both steady-state and transient thermal conduction analyses. Through a series of numerical examples, the accuracy and convergence of the proposed method were validated. The results demonstrate that mesh refinement leads to superior accuracy for the PSBFEM compared to the FEM. Moreover, Polyhedral elements provide an effective and efficient approach for complex simulations that substantially reduces computational costs.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Neural Networks for Approximating Green's Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have been widely used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) in the applications of physics, biology, and engineering. One effective approach for solving PDEs with a fixed differential operator is learning Green's functions. However, Green's functions are notoriously difficult to learn due to their poor regularity, which typically requires larger NNs and longer training times. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging multiscale NNs to learn Green's functions. Through theoretical analysis using multiscale Barron space methods and experimental validation, we show that the multiscale approach significantly reduces the necessary NN size and accelerates training.</description>

      <title>Vanilla Feedforward Neural Networks as a Discretization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has made significant applications in the field of data science and natural science. Some studies have linked deep neural networks to dynamic systems, but the network structure is restricted to the residual network. It is known that residual networks can be regarded as a numerical discretization of dynamic systems. In this paper, we back to the classical network structure and prove that the vanilla feedforward networks could also be a numerical discretization of dynamic systems, where the width of the network is equal to the dimension of the input and output. Our proof is based on the properties of the leaky-ReLU function and the numerical technique of splitting method to solve differential equations. Our results could provide a new perspective for understanding the approximation properties of feedforward neural networks.</description>

      <title>A first-order augmented Lagrangian method for constrained minimax optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of constrained minimax problems. In particular, we propose a first-order augmented Lagrangian method for solving them, whose subproblems turn out to be a much simpler structured minimax problem and are suitably solved by a first-order method developed in this paper. Under some suitable assumptions, an \emph{operation complexity} of $O(\varepsilon^{-4}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured by its fundamental operations, is established for the first-order augmented Lagrangian method for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the constrained minimax problems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of linear Port-Hamiltonian Descriptor Systems via Output Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure preserving stabilization of (possibly non-regular) linear port-Hamiltonian descriptor (pHDAE) systems by output feedback is discussed. For general descriptor systems the characterization when there exist output feedbacks that lead to an asymptotically stable closed loop system is a very hard and partially an open problem. In contrast to this it is shown that for systems in pHDAE representation this problem can be completely solved. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented that guarantee that there exist a proportional and/or derivative output feedback such that the resulting closed-loop port-Hamiltonian descriptor system is asymptotically stable. For this it is also necessary that the output feedback also makes the problem regular and of index at most one. A complete characterization when this is possible is presented as well.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Aided Construction of Multivariate Chebyshev Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with an extension of univariate Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind to the multivariate setting, where one chases best approximants to specific monomials by polynomials of lower degree relative to the uniform norm. Exploiting the Moment-SOS hierarchy, we devise a versatile semidefinite-programming-based procedure to compute such best approximants, as well as associated signatures. Applying this procedure in three variables leads to the values of best approximation errors for all monomials up to degree six on the euclidean ball, the simplex, and the cross-polytope. Furthermore, inspired by numerical experiments, we obtain explicit expressions for Chebyshev polynomials in two cases unresolved before, namely for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2^2 x_3$ on the euclidean ball and for the monomial $x_1^2 x_2 x_3$ on the simplex.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two efficient and stable algorithms for recovering phase factors in quantum signal processing (QSP), a crucial component of many quantum algorithms. The first algorithm, the ``Half Cholesky" method, which is based on nonlinear Fourier analysis and fast solvers for structured matrices, demonstrates robust performance across all regimes. The second algorithm, ``Fast Fixed Point Iteration," provides even greater efficiency in the non-fully-coherent regime. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantages of these new methods over all existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Gradient-adjusted underdamped Langevin dynamics for sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a target distribution is a fundamental problem. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), derived from the overdamped Langevin dynamics, have been extensively studied. From an optimization perspective, the Kolmogorov forward equation of the overdamped Langevin dynamics can be treated as the gradient flow of the relative entropy in the space of probability densities embedded with Wassrstein-2 metrics. Several efforts have also been devoted to including momentum-based methods, such as underdamped Langevin dynamics for faster convergence of sampling algorithms. Recent advances in optimizations have demonstrated the effectiveness of primal-dual damping and Hessian-driven damping dynamics for achieving faster convergence in solving optimization problems. Motivated by these developments, we introduce a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) called gradient-adjusted underdamped Langevin dynamics (GAUL), which add stochastic perturbations in primal-dual damping dynamics and Hessian-driven damping dynamics from optimization. We prove that GAUL admits the correct stationary distribution, whose marginal is the target distribution. The proposed method outperforms overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics regarding convergence speed in the total variation distance for Gaussian target distributions. Moreover, using the Euler-Maruyama discretization, we show that the mixing time towards a biased target distribution only depends on the square root of the condition number of the target covariance matrix. Numerical experiments for non-Gaussian target distributions, such as Bayesian regression problems and Bayesian neural networks, further illustrate the advantages of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>
