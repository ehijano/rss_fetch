      <title>Trivial Isochronous Centers in Odd Degrees: a Two--Branch Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the characterization of \emph{trivial} isochronous centers for planar polynomial Hamiltonian systems in degrees $5$ and $7$ obtained by Braun--Llibre--Mereu, and we formalize two conclusions suggested by their method. First, a \emph{triangular family} yields trivial (indeed global) isochronous centers in every odd degree $n=2k-1\geq3$. Second, a genuinely different \emph{quadratic--shear} ($Q$) family appears exactly when $n\equiv3\pmod 4$, beginning at $n=7$, explaining the observed \textquotedblleft alternating\textquotedblright\ emergence of a second branch. For $n=9$ this second branch cannot occur by degree parity. Our statements rest on the structure of the degree--7 proof and the general triangular construction in the preprint, together with the standard isochrony characterization $\mathcal{H}=\tfrac{1}{2}(f_{1}^{2}+f_{2}^{2})$ with $\det Df\equiv1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractors of iterated function systems are usually obtained as the Hausdorff limit of any non-empty compact subset under iteration. In this note we show that an iterated function system on a boundedly compact metric space has compact, invariant subspaces so that the attractor of the IFS can also be expressed as the intersection of a sequence of decreasing compact spaces.</description>

      <title>Absolute continuity of stationary measures for random surface dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find conditions for stationary measures of random dynamical systems on surfaces having dissipative diffeomorphisms to be absolutely continuous. These conditions involve a uniformly expanding on average property in the future (UEF) and past (UEP). Our results can cover random dynamical systems generated by "very dissipative" diffeomorphisms and perturbations of volume preserving surface diffeomorphisms. For example, we can consider a random dynamical system on $\mathbb{T}^2$ generated by perturbations of a pair of non-commuting infinite order toral automorphisms with any arbitrary single diffeomorphism. In this case, we conclude that stationary measures are either atomic or absolutely continuous. We also obtain an orbit classification and equidistribution result.</description>

      <title>Spectral instability of the regular n-gon elliptic relative equilibrium in the planar n-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regular $n$-gon elliptic relative equilibrium (ERE) is a Kepler homographic solution generated by the regular $n$-gon central configuration, and its linear stability depends on the eccentricity $\mathfrak{e}\in[0,1)$. While Moeckel \cite{Moe1} established the spectral instability for this solution at $\mathfrak{e}=0$ for all $n\geq3$, it remained unknown whether instability persists for $\mathfrak{e} \in (0,1)$. This paper resolves this problem: we prove that the regular $n$-gon ERE is spectral instability for all $n\geq 3$ and $\mathfrak{e} \in [0,1)$. Furthermore, we introduce the $\beta$-system which related the Lagrange solution, and we developed an estimation method that, by testing the hyperbolicity of the $\beta$-system at a finite number of points alone, allows us to obtain extensive hyperbolic regions. As a corollary, for $n=3,4,5$, we uniformly demonstrate that the instability is hyperbolic (and hence stronger) for all $\mathfrak{e} \in [0,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof of the conjecture by Bonifant and Milnor (see arXiv:2503.08868) regarding the similarity between the connectedness locus of the curve $\mathcal{S}_p$ at Misiurewicz parameters and their corresponding filled Julia sets in a neighborhood of the corresponding free co-critical point. The proof is in parallel with the generalization of Tan Lei's proof of similarity in the Mandelbrot set developed by Kawahira.</description>

      <title>On the Similarity between Epidemiologic Strains, Minimal Self-Replicable Siphons, and autocatalytic cores in (Chemical) Reaction Networks: Towards a Unifying Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to study boundary stability and persistence of positive odes in mathematical epidemiology models by importing structural tools from chemical reaction networks. This is largely a review work, which attempts to bring closer together the fields of mathematical epidemiology (ME), and chemical reaction networks (CRNs), based on several observations. We started by observing the conceptual correspondence between epidemiologic strains and both critical minimal siphons and minimal autocatalytic sets (cores) in an underlying CRN, and confirmed this in all the models we studied. We leverage this to provide a definition of the disease free equilibrium (DFE) face/infected set as the union of either all minimal siphons, or of all cores (they coincide always in our examples). Next, we provide a proposed definition of ME models, as models which have a unique boundary fixed point on the DFE face, and for which the Jacobian of the infected subnetwork admits a regular splitting, which allows defining the famous next generating matrix (NGM). We then define the interaction graph on minimal siphons (IGMS), whose vertices are minimal siphons, and whose edges indicate the existence of reactions producing species in one siphon from species in another. When this graph is acyclic, we say the model exhibits a Acyclic Minimal Siphon Decomposition (AMSD). For AMSD models whose minimal siphons partition the infection species, we show that the NGM is block triangular after permutation, which implies the classical max structure of the reproduction number R0 for multi-strain models. We implement algorithms to compute IGMS and detect AMSD in the Epid-CRN Mathematica package (https://github.com/florinav/EpidCRNmodels) (which contains already modules to identify minimal siphons, criticality, drainability, self-replicability, etc).</description>

      <title>On the closedness of ergodic measures in a characteristic class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We endow the set of all invariant measures of a topological dynamical system with a metric $\bar{\rho}$, which induces a topology stronger than the the weak$^*$-topology. Then, we study the closedness of ergodic measures within a characteristic class under this metric. Specifically, we show that if a sequence of generic points associated with ergodic measures from a fixed characteristic class converges in the Besicovitch pseudometric, then the limit point is generic for an ergodic measure in the same class. This implies that the set of ergodic measures belonging to a fixed characteristic class is closed in $\bar{\rho}$ (by a result of Babel, Can, Kwietniak, and Oprocha in [1]).</description>

      <title>A Flat Triangular Structure Based on a Multi-Chained Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining whether a nonlinear multi-input system is differentially flat remains challenging. One way to obtain computationally tractable sufficient conditions is to give complete characterizations of flat normal forms. We introduce a structurally flat triangular form for control-affine systems with at least three inputs that is based on a multi-chained form. For two specific instances of this structure, we provide complete geometric characterizations: necessary and sufficient conditions under which a control-affine system is static-feedback equivalent to the respective triangular form. These characterizations yield sufficient conditions for differential flatness and, in turn, constructive procedures for computing flat outputs.</description>

      <title>A Radial and Tangential Framework for Studying Transient Reactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modeling biological systems and other applications, an important recurring question is whether those systems maintain healthy regimes not just at dynamic attractors but also during transient excursions away from those attractors. For ODE models, these excursions are not due only to nonlinearities. Even in a linear, autonomous system with a global attractor at the origin, some trajectories will move transiently away from the origin before eventually being attracted asymptotically. Reactivity, defined by Neubert and Caswell in 1997, captures this idea of transient amplification of perturbations by measuring the maximum instantaneous rate of radial growth. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for analyzing reactivity and transient dynamics in two-dimensional linear ODEs using a radial and tangential decomposition of the vector field. We establish how to view the eigen-structure of the system through this lens and introduce a matching structure of orthovectors and orthovalues that characterize where the radial velocity becomes positive. From this perspective, we gain geometric insight about the regions of state space where positive radial growth occurs and how solutions trajectories traverse through these regions. Additionally, we propose four standard matrix forms that characterize both transient and asymptotic behavior and which highlight reactivity features more directly. Finally, we apply our framework to explore the limits of reactivity and maximal amplification and to characterize how transient reactivity can accumulate in nonautonomous linear systems to result in asymptotically unstable behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish effective bounds on the number of periodic points of degree-$d$ polynomials $\phi$ defined over $p$-adic fields and number fields, under a mild reduction hypothesis that is satisfied by all unicritical polynomials $X^d + c$ with $c$ integral at some prime dividing $d$. As a consequence, we verify the uniform boundedness conjecture for this class of polynomials over number fields $K$, giving the explicit uniform bound $\#\mathrm{Per}_K(\phi) \leq d^{[K:\mathbb{Q}]}$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we give completely new examples of embedded complex manifolds the germ of neighborhood of which is holomorphically equivalent to a germ of neighborhood of the zero section in its normal bundle. The first set of examples is composed of connected abelian complex Lie groups, embedded in some complex manifold $M$. These are non compact manifolds in general. We also give some conditions ensuring the existence a holomorphic foliation having the embedded manifold as leaf. The second set of examples are $n$-dimensional Hopf manifolds, embedded as hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Life-cycle Modeling and the Walking Behavior of the Pedestrian-Group as an Emergent Agent: With Empirical Data on the Cohesion of the Group Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modelling of Hopf bifurcations for the Navier-Stokes equations through invariant manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a parametric simulation-free reduced order model for incompressible flows undergoing a Hopf bifurcation, leveraging the parametrisation method for invariant manifolds. Unlike data-driven approaches, this method operates directly on the governing equations, eliminating the need for full-order simulations. The proposed model is computed at a single value of the bifurcation parameter yet remains valid over a range of values. The approach systematically constructs an invariant manifold and embedded dynamics, providing an accurate and efficient reduction of the original system. The ability to capture pre-critical steady states, the bifurcation point, and post-critical limit cycle oscillations is demonstrated by a strong agreement between the reduced order model and full order simulations, while achieving significant computational speed-up.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian heat flows on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a semigroup framework for Laplacians on directed hypergraphs, extending the classical heat flow models on graphs and establishing hypergraphs as prototypical models for non-Markovian diffusion. We apply spectral surgery methods to derive eigenvalue bounds, thus describing large-time behaviour of the heat flow. Unlike on standard graphs, heat flows on directed hypergraphs may lose positivity and/or $\infty$-contractivity, yet can recover them eventually or asymptotically under specific combinatorial configurations: examples based on duals of oriented graph and realisations of the Fano plane illustrate these phenomena.
  Our approach combines combinatorial, order-theoretic and linear-algebraic methods.</description>

      <title>Apocalypsis and Apocalyptic Events: The Morphogenetic Ontology of Synchronized Catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I formalize the ontology of apocalyptic events as synchronized morphogenetic manifolds within the framework of Thom's catastrophe theory. Local catastrophes (folds, cusps, umbilici) are extended to higher-order systemic collapses through the synchronization of multiple morphogenetic manifolds. The resulting construct is the Apocalypsis: a topological meta-singularity generated by the alignment of local singularities into a global structure of collapse. The mathematical formalization of Apocalyptic events and Apocalypsis integrates dynamical systems theory, topological stability, and probabilistic dependence structures using Archimedean copulas that capture nonlinear interrelations among coupled subsystems. The Inevitability Theorem demonstrates the existence, genericity, and almost-sure occurrence of Apocalypsis under stochastic coupling.</description>

      <title>High Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Cover-Based Distributed Observer Approach</title>

Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, This paper presents a coverage solution algorithm for large-scale systems that accounts for both physical and communication network characteristics, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the cover-based distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between cover sets. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proved, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the cover-based distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the cover-based distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show the validity of the developed theories.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</description>
