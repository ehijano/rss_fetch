      <title>FlexPINN: Modeling Fluid Dynamics and Mass Transfer in 3D Micromixer Geometries Using a Flexible Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, fluid flow and concentration distribution inside a 3D T-shaped micromixer with various fin shapes and configurations are investigated using a Flexible Physics-Informed Neural Network (FlexPINN), which includes modifications over the vanilla PINN architecture. Three types of fins (rectangular, elliptical, and triangular) are considered to evaluate the influence of fin geometry, along with four different fin configurations inside the 3D channel to examine the effect of placement. The simulations are conducted at four Reynolds numbers: 5, 20, 40, and 80, in both single-unit (four fins) and double-unit (eight fins) configurations. The goal is to assess pressure drop coefficient, mixing index, and mixing efficiency using the FlexPINN method. Given the challenges in simulating 3D problems with standard PINN, several improvements are introduced. The governing equations are injected into the network as first-order, dimensionless derivatives to enhance accuracy. Transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost, and adaptive loss weighting is applied to improve convergence compared to the vanilla PINN approach. These modifications enable a consistent and flexible architecture that can be used across numerous tested cases. Using the proposed FlexPINN method, the pressure drop coefficient and mixing index are predicted with maximum errors of 3.25% and 2.86%, respectively, compared to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. Among all the tested cases, the rectangular fin with configuration C in the double-unit setup at Reynolds number 40 shows the highest mixing efficiency, reaching a value of 1.63. The FlexPINN framework demonstrates strong capabilities in simulating fluid flow and species transport in complex 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry-breaking instability of the flow past axisymmetric bluff bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary bifurcation of the flow past three-dimensional axisymmetric bodies is investigated. We show that the azimuthal vorticity generated at the body surface is at the root of the instability, and that the mechanism proposed by Magnaudet and Mougin (2007) in the context of spheroidal bubbles extends to axisymmetric bodies with a no-slip surface. The instability arises in a thin region of the flow in the near wake and is associated with the occurrence of strong vorticity gradients. We propose a simple yet effective scaling law for the prediction of the instability, based on a measure of the near-wake vorticity and of the radial extent of the separation bubble. At criticality, the resulting Reynolds number collapses approximately to a constant value for bodies with different geometries and aspect ratios, with a relative variation that is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the standard Reynolds number based on the free-stream velocity and body diameter. The new scaling can be useful to assess whether the steady flow past axisymmetric bodies is globally unstable, without the need for an additional stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Line Stretching in Random Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An \emph{ab initio} analysis of stretching of the length $l(t)$ of material lines in steady and unsteady random chaotic flows is performed under Fickian and non-Fickian (anomalous) transport. We show that fluid stretching is an autocatalytic process with finite sampling that is governed by a competition between ensemble and temporal averaging processes. The topological entropy $h\equiv \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} \ln l(t)/t$ converges to the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_\infty$ in Fickian flows, whereas in non-Fickian flows $h$ aconverges to $\lambda_\infty$ plus a contribution from the variance $\sigma_\lambda^2$ of the finite time Lyapunov exponent. This study uncovers the rich dynamics of deformation in random flows, provides methods to characterize deformation from macroscopic observations, corrects classical fluid stretching models and calls for a reassessment of experimental data and fluid stretching models in turbulent and chaotic flows.</description>

      <title>RapidPIV: Full Flow-Field kHz PIV for Real-Time Display and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel architecture for accelerating PIV calculations. An optical flow hardware accelerator does the brunt of the work, with cross-correlation only providing quick corrections. The result is RapidPIV: a free-to-download software program for real-time particle image velocimetry (PIV) for Linux and Windows computers with an Nvidia Turing-gen (or newer) GPU (RapidPIV download at https://rapidpiv.caltech.edu). Dense vector fields and vorticity can be displayed in real time when connected to compatible camera. Processing pre-existing PIV image files is also supported. We achieve 1,150 frames-per-second on 1 megapixel images. Accuracy, repeatability, and robustness are tested with physical experiments involving an accelerated flat plate and a cylinder wake. RapidPIV's accuracy, precision and ability to handle high displacement, velocity gradients, out-of-plane motion, and low seeding density compare favorably with the trusted multi-grid correlation software. However, RapidPIV is a thousand times faster.</description>

      <title>HOSVD-SR: A Physics-Based Deep Learning Framework for Super-Resolution in Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a novel methodology that combines Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) with Deep Learning (DL) techniques for super-resolution in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and sparse experimental datasets. This approach, referred to as HOSVD-SR 1, integrates modal decomposition techniques with Machine Learning (ML), creating a hybrid model grounded in the underlying physics of the studied phenomena and capable of enhancing data dimensionality. The proposed methodology leverages HOSVD, a robust variant of SVD, ideal for high dimensional data, which extracts the singular values and modes (spatial and temporal) associated with each dimension of the database in tensor form, reducing noise and addressing challenges related to turbulent flows. HOSVD is employed to capture the key physical patterns from a under-resolved fluid mechanics database. Each spatial mode matrix serves as input for a decoder/autoencoder type neural network trained to increase the dimensionality of the tensor and accurately reconstruct experimental and CFD-like databases. The HOSVD-SR methodology has been tested on both two- and three-dimensional numerical databases of flow past a circular cylinder, as well as an experimental database of circular cylinder wake flows under a turbulent flow regime. HOSVD-SR has successfully addressed both laminar and turbulent cases, outperforming a previously proposed SVD-based methodology in terms of accuracy. HOSVD-SR is physics-based, making it a robust and highly generalizable method that can also be implemented for other data generation approaches in fluid mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Acoustic turbulence: from the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectra to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a brief review on theoretical and numerical works on three-dimensional acoustic turbulence both in a weakly nonlinear regime, when the amplitudes of sound waves are small, and in the case of strong nonlinearity. This review is based on the classical studies on weak acoustic turbulence by V.E. Zakharov (1965) and V.E. Zakharov and R.Z. Sagdeev (1970), on the one hand, and on the other hand, by B.B. Kadomtsev and V.I. Petviashvili (1972). Until recently, there were no convincing numerical experiments confirming one or the other point of view. In the works of the authors of this review in 2022 and 2024, strong arguments were found based on direct numerical modeling in favor of both theories. It is shown that the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum of weak turbulence $\propto k^{-3/2}$ is realized not only for small positive dispersion of sound waves, but also in the case of complete absence of dispersion. The calculated turbulence spectra in the weakly nonlinear regime have anisotropic distribution: for small $k$, narrow cones (jets) are formed, broadening in the Fourier space. For weak dispersion, the jets are smoothed out, and the turbulence spectrum tends to be isotropic in the region of short wavelengths. In the absence of dispersion, the turbulence spectrum is a discrete set of jets subjected to diffraction divergence. For each individual jet, nonlinear effects are much weaker than diffraction ones, which prevents the formation of shock waves. Thus, the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum is realized due to the smallness of nonlinear effects compared to dispersion or diffraction. As the pumping level increases in the non-dispersive regime, when nonlinear effects begin to dominate, shock waves are formed. As a result, acoustic turbulence passes into a strongly nonlinear state in the form of an ensemble of random shocks described by the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum $\propto k^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>A generalized fundamental solution technique for the regularized 13-moment system in rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for solving the regularized 13-moment (R13) equations for rarefied monatomic gases. While previous applications of the MFS in rarefied gas flows relied on problem-specific fundamental solutions, we propose a generic approach that systematically computes the fundamental solutions for any linear moment system without predefined source terms. The generalized framework is first introduced using a simple example involving the Stokes equations, and is then extended to the R13 equations. The results obtained from the generic MFS are validated against an analytical solution for the R13 equations. Following validation, the framework is applied to the case of thermally-induced flow between two non-coaxial cylinders. Since no analytical solution exists for this case, we compare the results obtained from the MFS with those obtained from the finite element method (FEM). To further assess computational efficiency, we analyze the runtimes of the FEM and MFS. The results indicate that the MFS converges faster than the FEM and serves as a promising alternative to conventional meshing-based techniques.</description>

      <title>Development of a Scaled Down Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine for Wind Tunnel Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to design and develop scaled down models of Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) to test in a limited sized wind tunnel. The mathematical design of a HAWT is carried out at a rated speed of 5 m/s, by using QBlade, which is based on BEM theory. The 1.0 m long blade is scaled to 0.15 m with geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarity conditions. This model was tested in an existing open circuit wind tunnel with 0.38 x 0.38 m2 test section at Fluid Lab of Kathmandu University. A physical model of the turbine is developed using additive manufacturing method. For experiments conducted at pitch angles 0 degrees and 5 degrees, the turbine response is found to be better at the latter angle with a maximum coefficient of performance of 0.32. This paper also presents graphical analysis of experimental results along with computational analysis for model validation. The method described in this paper can be implemented for conducting a cost-effective experimental validation of wind turbines designed for laboratorial or industrial purposes.</description>

      <title>Swash flow due to obliquely incident bores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new solution to the nonlinear shallow water equations and show that it accurately predicts the swash flow due to obliquely approaching bores in large-scale wave basin experiments. The solution is based on an application of Snell's law of refraction in settings where the bore approach angle $\theta$ is small. We use the weakly two-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations [Ryrie (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 129, 1983, p. 193)], where the cross-shore dynamics are independent of, and act as a forcing to, the alongshore dynamics. Using a known solution to the cross-shore dynamics [Antuono (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 658, 2010, p. 166)], we solve for the alongshore flow using the method of characteristics and show that it differs from previous solutions. Since the cross-shore solution assumes a constant forward-moving characteristic variable, $\alpha$, we term our solution the `small-$\theta$, constant-$\alpha$' solution. We test our solution in large-scale experiments with data from fifteen wave cases, including normally incident waves and obliquely incident waves generated using the wall reflection method. We measure water depths and fluid velocities using in situ sensors within the surf and swash zones and track shoreline motion using quantitative imaging. The data show that the basic assumptions of the theory (Snell's law of refraction and constant-$\alpha$) are satisfied and that our solution accurately predicts the swash flow. In particular, the data agrees well with our expression for the time-averaged alongshore velocity, which is expected to improve predictions of alongshore transport at coastlines.</description>

      <title>Online learning to accelerate nonlinear PDE solvers: applied to multiphase porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of nonlinear solver acceleration for systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) that is based on online/adaptive learning. It is applied in the context of multiphase flow in porous media. The proposed method rely on four pillars: (i) dimensionless numbers as input parameters for the machine learning model, (ii) simplified numerical model (two-dimensional) for the offline training, (iii) dynamic control of a nonlinear solver tuning parameter (numerical relaxation), (iv) and online learning for real-time improvement of the machine learning model. This strategy decreases the number of nonlinear iterations by dynamically modifying a single global parameter, the relaxation factor, and by adaptively learning the attributes of each numerical model on-the-run. Furthermore, this work performs a sensitivity study in the dimensionless parameters (machine learning features), assess the efficacy of various machine learning models, demonstrate a decrease in nonlinear iterations using our method in more intricate, realistic three-dimensional models, and fully couple a machine learning model into an open-source multiphase flow simulator achieving up to 85\% reduction in computational time.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Based Concurrent Coupling Approach for Cryogenic Propellant Tank Long-term Pressure Control Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and optimization of cryogenic propellant storage tanks for NASA's future space missions require fast and accurate predictions of long-term fluid behaviors. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are high-fidelity but computationally prohibitive. Coarse mesh nodal techniques are fast but heavily rely on empirical correlations to capture prominent three-dimensional phenomena. A data-driven based concurrent coupling (DCC) approach has been developed to integrate CFD with nodal techniques for efficient and accurate analysis. This concurrent coupling scheme generates case-specific correlations on the fly through a short period of co-solving CFD and nodal simulations, followed by a long-period nodal simulation with CFD-corrected solutions. This paper presents the approach development, stability analysis, and efficiency demonstration, specifically for modeling two-phase cryogenic propellant tank self-pressurization and periodic mixing phenomena. Linear regression is employed to derive the data-driven correlations. The self-pressurization experiments of Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed experiments and K-Site tank are used to validate the approach. The DCC approach accurately predicts temperature stratifications while reducing computational time by as much as 70% compared to pure CFD simulations. Additionally, the DCC approach mitigates the risks of numerical instability and correlation loss inherent in current domain decomposition or overlapping-based coupling methods, making it a flexible and user-friendly approach for integrated CFD and nodal analysis of cryogenic tank behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an empirical extension of Yakhot's model of strong turbulence [V. Yakhot, Phys. Rev. E 57(2) (1998)] that correctly describes the statistics of longitudinal velocity increments not only in the inertial range but also for larger scales up to the system length scale L. Two additional parameters are introduced to the original equation for the probability density function of velocity increments. These parameters can be motivated by physical arguments and their values are fixed by large scale boundary conditions. The resultant model ensures correct convergence of structure functions at the system length scale, including vanishing slopes at L, and shows good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Mixed Convection and Entropy Generation Analysis of Carbon Nanotube-Water Nanofluid in a Square Cavity with Cylinders and Flow Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the mixed convection of carbon nanotube (CNT)-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number ($Re$), Richardson number ($Ri$), Hartmann number ($Ha$), wavy wall peaks ($n$), nanoparticle volume fraction ($\phi$), Hartmann angle ($\gamma$), rotational speed ($\omega$), and inclination angle ($\alpha$), on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. MWCNT nanofluids exhibit up to a 19.1% increase in $Nu_{\text{ave}}$ compared to SWCNT nanofluids, confirming their superior heat transfer performance. Adding a second heated cylinder increases $Nu_{\text{ave}}$ by approximately 71.7% compared to a single-cylinder configuration, while the inclusion of a flow deflector modifies vortex structures, further enhancing convective transport. Increasing wavy wall peaks ($n$) enhances heat transfer by intensifying vortex formation and disrupting thermal boundary layers, leading to a more uniform temperature distribution. SWCNT nanofluids exhibit Bejan numbers up to 58.7% higher than MWCNT nanofluids, indicating greater thermal irreversibility. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates speed-accuracy trade-off aspects for geometry simplification of blood flow in realistic arteries obtained from Computed Tomography (CT) scan data. The study uses realistic inflow (with mean Re = 313.6 and peak Re = 1687 based on Newtonian viscosity) and outlet boundary conditions with Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood viscosity models, including the one developed by Apostolidis and Beris et al. Similar studies exist to predict the progression of atherosclerosis, clots, and thrombus formation in arteries. However, these assume smooth flow geometries. In contrast, realistic arteries possess significant amounts of roughness, perturbations, and undulations. To understand their impact, studies are performed with two levels of geometry simplifications. Our results indicate that flow field predictions on these simplified geometries are visibly affected. The first level of simplification loses the local asymmetry but is able to reasonably approximate various parameters, capturing patterns with the correct magnitude. However, further simplification to a smooth one does not show vortex structures in the flow field. The flow recirculation zones near wall perturbations progressively weaken as the geometry is smoothed. On the other hand, no significant differences are observed between Newtonian and non-Newtonian models in this study. Our analysis also enables a speed-accuracy trade-off for future applications. The number of iterations to convergence becomes progressively lower as geometry is simplified, with nearly four times the difference obtained even with the first level of simplification. Further, the computational time for the Newtonian model is nearly 10 times smaller than the non-Newtonian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Intermittency and non-universality of pair dispersion in isothermal compressible turbulence</title>

Abstract: Statistical properties of the pair dispersion of Lagrangian particles (tracers) in incompressible turbulent flows provide insights into transport and mixing. We explore the same in transonic to supersonic compressible turbulence of an isothermal ideal gas in two dimensions, driven by large-scale solenoidal and irrotational stirring forces, via direct numerical simulations. We find that the scaling exponents of the order-$p$ negative moments of the distribution of exit times -- in particular, the doubling and halving times of pair separations -- are nonlinear functions of $p$. Furthermore, the doubling and halving time statistics are different. The halving-time exponents are universal -- they satisfy their multifractal model-based prediction, irrespective of the nature of the stirring. However, the doubling-time exponents are not. In the solenoidally-stirred flows, the doubling time exponents can be expressed solely in terms of the multifractal scaling exponents obtained from the structure functions of the solenoidal component of the velocity. Moreover, they depend strongly on the Mach number, $\Ma$, as elongated patches of high vorticity emerge along shock fronts at high $\Ma$. In contrast, in the irrotationally-stirred flows, the doubling-time exponents do not satisfy any known multifractal model-based relation, and are independent of $\Ma$. Our findings are of potential relevance to astrophysical disks and molecular clouds wherein turbulent transport and mixing of gases often govern chemical kinetics and the rates of formation of stars and planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>

Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>
