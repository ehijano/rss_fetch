      <title>Dimension of Bernoulli Convolutions in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{d})=\lambda\in(0,1)^{d}$ with $\lambda_{1}&gt;...&gt;\lambda_{d}$, denote by $\mu_{\lambda}$ the Bernoulli convolution associated to $\lambda$. That is, $\mu_{\lambda}$ is the distribution of the random vector $\sum_{n\ge0}\pm\left(\lambda_{1}^{n},...,\lambda_{d}^{n}\right)$, where the $\pm$ signs are chosen independently and with equal weight. Assuming for each $1\le j\le d$ that $\lambda_{j}$ is not a root of a polynomial with coefficients $\pm1,0$, we prove that the dimension of $\mu_{\lambda}$ equals $\min\left\{ \dim_{L}\mu_{\lambda},d\right\} $, where $\dim_{L}\mu_{\lambda}$ is the Lyapunov dimension. More generally, we obtain this result in the context of homogeneous diagonal self-affine systems on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with rational translations.
  The proof extends to higher dimensions the works of Breuillard and Varj\'u and Varj\'u regarding Bernoulli convolutions on the real line. The main novelty and contribution of the present work lies in an extension of an entropy increase result, due to Varj\'u, in which the amount of increase in entropy is given explicitly. The extension of this result to the higher-dimensional non-conformal case requires significant new ideas.</description>

      <title>The negative energy N-body problem has finite diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jacobi-Maupertuis metric provides a reformulation of the classical N-body problem as a geodesic flow on an energy-dependent metric space denoted $M_E$ where $E$ is the energy of the problem. We show that $M_E$ has finite diameter for $E &lt; 0$. Consequently $M_E$ has no metric rays. Motivation comes from work of Burgos- Maderna and Polimeni-Terracini for the case $E \ge 0$ and from a need to correct an error made in a previous ``proof''. We show that $M_E$ has finite diameter for $E &lt; 0$ by showing that there is a constant $D$ such that all points of the Hill region lie a distance $D$ from the Hill boundary. (When $E \ge 0$ the Hill boundary is empty.) The proof relies on a game of escape which allows us to quantify the escape rate from a closed subset of configuration space, and the reduction of this game to one of escaping the boundary of a polyhedral convex cone into its interior.</description>

      <title>Lorenz equations and the figure eight knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorenz equations were first presented in 1963 by Edward Lorenz, they depend on three real positive parameters. For some of these parameters which are called T-points, there are two heteroclinic orbits connecting the three singular points in the equations. The heteroclinic connections can be extended into an invariant curve passing through infinity. We consider the system at the second T-point parameter, and develop a geometric model for the flow that simulates the Lorenz dynamics there. We show that the model contains infinitely many periodic orbits, and that as knots they are all positive, prime and fibered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first rates of convergence to an $N$-dimensional Brownian motion when $N\ge2$ for discrete and continuous time dynamical systems. Additionally, we provide the first rates for continuous time in any dimension. Our results hold for nonuniformly hyperbolic and expanding systems, such as Axiom A flows, suspensions over a Young tower with exponential tails, and some classes of intermittent solenoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, under certain conditions we consider two-dimensional cellular automata with the Moore neighborhood. Namely, the characterization of 2D linear cellular automata defined by the Moore neighborhood with some mixed boundary conditions over the field $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is studied. Furthermore, we investigate the rule matrices of 2D Moore CA under some mixed boundary conditions by applying rotation. Finally, we give the conditions under which the obtained rule matrices for 2D finite CAs are reversible.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for lattice point counting on tessellated domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the approach of Bj$\ddot{\text{o}}$rklund and Gorodnik, we have considered the discrepancy function for lattice point counting on domains that can be nicely tessellated by the action of a diagonal semigroup. We have shown that suitably normalized discrepancy functions for lattice point counting on certain tessellated domains satisfy a non-degenerate central limit theorem. Furthermore, we have also addressed the same problem for affine and congruence lattice point counting, proving analogous non-degenerate central limit theorems for them. The main ingredients of the proofs are the method of cumulants and quantitative multiple mixing estimates.</description>

      <title>RandONet: Shallow-Networks with Random Projections for learning linear and nonlinear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepOnets) have revolutionized the domain of scientific machine learning for the solution of the inverse problem for dynamical systems. However, their implementation necessitates optimizing a high-dimensional space of parameters and hyperparameters. This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla" DeepOnets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic calculus for the theta process. The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of hypersurfaces in any contact manifold of dimension 5 and larger that cannot be $C^2$-approximated by convex hypersurfaces. This contrasts sharply with the foundational result of Giroux in dimension $3$ and the work of Honda-Huang in the $C^0$ setting. The main technical step is the construction of a Bonatti-Diaz type blender in the contact setting.</description>

      <title>The class and dynamics of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each ordinal $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, we introduce the class of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. These classes form a hierarchy that completely stratifies the space between the class of Polish groups admitting a two-side-invariant metric (TSI) and the class of Polish groups admitting a complete left-invariant metric (CLI). We establish various closure properties, provide connections to model theory, and we develop a boundedness principle for CLI groups by showing that $\alpha$-balancedness is an initial segment of a regular coanalytic rank.
  In the spirit of Hjorth's turbulence theory we also introduce "generic $\alpha$-unbalancedness": a new dynamical condition for Polish $G$-spaces which serves as an obstruction to classification by actions of $\alpha$-balanced Polish groups. We use this to provide, for each $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$, an action of an $\alpha$-balanced Polish group whose orbit equivalence relation is strongly generically ergodic against actions of any $\beta$-balanced Polish group with $\beta&lt;\alpha$.</description>

      <title>The rational rank of the support of generalized power series solutions of differential and $q$-difference equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a differential or $q$-difference equation $P$ of order $n$, we prove that the set of exponents of a generalized power series solution has its rational rank bounded by the rational rank of the support of $P$ plus $n$. We also prove that when the support of the solution has maximum rational rank, it is convergent. Using the Newton polygon technique, we show also that in the maximum rational rank case, an initial segment can always be completed to a true solution. The techniques are the same for the differential and the $q$-difference case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Approximation of Fading Mode in Neurooscillator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system consisting of two delay differential equations with a large parameter, modeling the association of a pair of neurooscillators. The unknown functions describe the changes in the normalized membrane potentials of neurons over time, with the large parameter characterizing the speed of electrical processes. The first equation is separated from the system and represents a generalized Hutchinson equation. This equation, as known, possesses periodic solutions with high peaks over the period. The second equation is also based on the generalized Hutchinson equation, but with an additional term, linking it to an oscillator satisfying the first equation. For the second equation, it is possible to asymptotically construct the so-called fading neuron mode, which is as follows: for any natural number $n$, one can adjust the parameters of the problem in such a way that the solution is asymptotically close to a periodic function with high peaks over $n$ periods, and then, after a transient process represented by decreasing peaks, becomes asymptotically small.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review some recent results dealing with the transition between microscopic and macroscopic scales in different fields, including kinetic theory, cells movement in biology, chemotaxis, flocking phenomena and agent systems. The methodology of the mean-field approach of this study uses  the concept of marginals instead of the empirical measure paradigm. Numerical computations showing some theoretically unexpected features are presented  at the end of the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by classical results by Benoist, we introduce and study natural objects associated to an integrable tangent vector to the character variety $\mathfrak X(\Gamma,\mathsf G)$ of a semi-group $\Gamma$, with values on a semi-simple real algebraic group $\mathsf G$ of the non-compact type. We obtain non-empty interior of the cone of Jordan variations and, when $\mathsf G$ is split and Benoist's limit cone is sparse, we obtain double-density results associated to these variations, giving in particular non-empty interior of the set of length-normalized variations. We then apply the developed techniques to study pressure forms on the space of Anosov representations, in particular to higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. Among other things we exhibit an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at the Fuchsian points of the Hitchin component. We finally exhibit a Diophantine equation that governs the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of higher-quasi-circles.</description>

      <title>Input Driven Synchronization of Chaotic Neural Networks with Analyticaly Determined Conditional Lyapunov Exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with random, but sufficiently strong and balanced coupling display a well known high-dimensional chaotic dynamics. Here, we investigate if externally applied inputs to these RNNs can stabilize globally synchronous, input-dependent solutions, in spite of the strong chaos-inducing coupling. We find that when the balance between excitation and inhibition is exact, that is when the row-sum of the weights is constant and 0, a globally applied input can readily synchronize all neurons onto a synchronous solution. The stability of the synchronous solution is analytically explored in this work with a master stability function. For any synchronous solution to the network dynamics, the conditional Lyapunov spectrum can be readily determined, with the stability of the synchronous solution critically dependent on the largest real eigenvalue component of the RNN weight matrix. We find that the smaller the maximum real component of the weight matrix eigenvalues, the more readily the network synchronizes. Further, the conditional Lyapunov exponents are easily computed numerically for any synchronization signal without simulating the RNN. Finally, for certain oscillatory synchronization signals, the conditional Lyapunov exponents can be determined analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a rational function of one complex variable, and $z_0$ its repelling fixed point with the multiplier $\lambda.$ Then a Poincar\'e function associated with $z_0$ is a function $\mathcal{P}_{A,z_0,\lambda}$ meromorphic on $\mathbb C$ such that $\mathcal{P}_{A,z_0,\lambda}(0)=z_0$, $\mathcal{P}_{A,z_0,\lambda}'(0)\neq 0,$ and $\mathcal{P}_{A,z_0,\lambda}(\lambda z)=A\circ \mathcal{P}_{A,z_0,\lambda}(z).$ In this paper, we investigate the following problem: given Poincar\'e functions $\mathcal{P}_{A_1,z_1,\lambda_1}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{A_2,z_2,\lambda_2}$, find out if there is an algebraic relation $f(\mathcal{P}_{A_1,z_1,\lambda_1},\mathcal{P}_{A_2,z_2,\lambda_2})=0$ between them and, if such a relation exists, describe the corresponding algebraic curve. We provide a solution, which can be viewed as a refinement of the classical theorem of Ritt about commuting rational functions. We also reprove and extend previous results concerning algebraic dependencies between B\"ottcher functions.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonholonomic motion of a point particle on the Heisenberg group around the fixed "sun" whose potential is given by the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian. Unlike arXiv:1212.2713 where the variational problem is studied we consider the equations of nonholonomic dynamics which are not Hamiltonian. We find three independent first integrals of the system and show that its bounded trajectories of the system are wound up around certain surfaces of the fourth order.</description>

Abstract: We study heavy tailed random variables obtained by sampling an observable with a power singularity along an orbit of an expanding map on the circle. In the regime where the observables have infinite variance, we show that the set of limit points of the ergodic sum process, rescaled by $N^{1/s} (\ln N)^\alpha$, where $s$ is the index of limiting stable law, equals to the set of piecewise constant increasing functions with finitely many jumps. The proof relies on the multiple Borel-Cantelli Lemma proven in Dolgopyat, Fayad and Liu [J. Mod. Dyn. 18 (2022) 209--289].</description>

      <title>Universal exponential pointwise convergence for weighted multiple ergodic averages over $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing an accelerated weighting method, we establish arbitrary polynomial and exponential pointwise convergence for multiple ergodic averages under general conditions in both discrete and continuous settings, involving quasi-periodic and almost periodic cases, which breaks the well known slow convergence rate observed in classical ergodic theory. We also present joint Diophantine rotations as explicit applications. Especially, in the sense that excluding nearly rational rotations with zero measure, we demonstrate that the pointwise exponential convergence is universal via analytic observables, even when multiplicatively averaging over the infinite-dimensional torus $ \mathbb{T}^\infty $, utilizing a novel truncated approach. Moreover, by constructing counterexamples concerning with multiple ergodicity, we highlight the irremovability of the joint nonresonance and establish the optimality of our weighting method in preserving rapid convergence. We also provide numerical simulations with analysis to further illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Ergodic optimization for continuous functions on non-Markov shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ergodic optimization aims to describe dynamically invariant probability measures that maximize the integral of a given function. For a wide class of intrinsically ergodic subshifts over a finite alphabet, we show that the space of continuous functions on the shift space splits into two subsets: one is a $G_\delta$ dense set for which all maximizing measures have `relatively small' entropy; the other is contained in the closure of the set of functions having uncountably many, fully supported ergodic measures with `relatively large' entropy. This result considerably generalizes and unifies the results of Morris (2010) and Shinoda (2018), and applies to a wide class of intrinsically ergodic non-Markov symbolic dynamics without Bowen's specification property, including any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map, some coded shifts and multidimensional $\beta$-transformations. Along with these examples of application, we provide an example of an intrinsically ergodic subshift with positive obstruction entropy to specification.</description>

      <title>Recurrent subspaces in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spaceability of the set of recurrent vectors $\text{Rec}(T)$ for an operator $T:X\longrightarrow X$ on a Banach space $X$. In particular: we find sufficient conditions for a quasi-rigid operator to have a recurrent subspace; when $X$ is a complex Banach space we show that having a recurrent subspace is equivalent to the fact that the essential spectrum of the operator intersects the closed unit disc; and we extend the previous result to the real case. As a consequence we obtain that: a weakly-mixing operator on a real or complex separable Banach space has a hypercyclic subspace if and only if it has a recurrent subspace. The results exposed exhibit a symmetry between the hypercyclic and recurrence spaceability theories showing that, at least for the spaceable property, hypercyclicity and recurrence can be treated as equals.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic State-Space Identification of Closed-Loop Stochastic Linear Systems using Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper suggests a generalization of the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) finite sample system identification method for the identification of closed-loop observable stochastic linear systems in state-space form. The solution builds on the theory of matrix-variate regression and instrumental variable methods to construct distribution-free confidence regions for the state-space matrices. Both direct and indirect identification are studied, and the exactness as well as the strong consistency of the construction are proved. Furthermore, a new, computationally efficient ellipsoidal outer-approximation algorithm for the confidence regions is proposed. The new construction results in a semidefinite optimization problem which has an order-of-magnitude smaller number of constraints, as if one applied the ellipsoidal outer-approximation after vectorization. The effectiveness of the approach is also demonstrated empirically via a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Safely Learning Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in learning an unknown dynamical system is to reduce model uncertainty by making measurements while maintaining safety. We formulate a mathematical definition of what it means to safely learn a dynamical system by sequentially deciding where to initialize trajectories. The state of the system must stay within a safety region for a horizon of $T$ time steps under the action of all dynamical systems that (i) belong to a given initial uncertainty set, and (ii) are consistent with information gathered so far.
  First, we consider safely learning a linear dynamical system involving $n$ states. For the case $T=1$, we present an LP-based algorithm that either safely recovers the true dynamics from at most $n$ trajectories, or certifies that safe learning is impossible. For $T=2$, we give an SDP representation of the set of safe initial conditions and show that $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ trajectories generically suffice for safe learning. For $T = \infty$, we provide SDP-representable inner approximations of the set of safe initial conditions and show that one trajectory generically suffices for safe learning. We extend a number of our results to the cases where the initial uncertainty set contains sparse, low-rank, or permutation matrices, or when the system has a control input.
  Second, we consider safely learning a general class of nonlinear dynamical systems. For the case $T=1$, we give an SOCP-based representation of the set of safe initial conditions. For $T=\infty$, we provide semidefinite representable inner approximations to the set of safe initial conditions. We show how one can safely collect trajectories and fit a polynomial model of the nonlinear dynamics that is consistent with the initial uncertainty set and best agrees with the observations. We also present some extensions to cases where the measurements are noisy or the dynamical system involves disturbances.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Domain Generalization in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In science we are interested in finding the governing equations, the dynamical rules, underlying empirical phenomena. While traditionally scientific models are derived through cycles of human insight and experimentation, recently deep learning (DL) techniques have been advanced to reconstruct dynamical systems (DS) directly from time series data. State-of-the-art dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) methods show promise in capturing invariant and long-term properties of observed DS, but their ability to generalize to unobserved domains remains an open challenge. Yet, this is a crucial property we would expect from any viable scientific theory. In this work, we provide a formal framework that addresses generalization in DSR. We explain why and how out-of-domain (OOD) generalization (OODG) in DSR profoundly differs from OODG considered elsewhere in machine learning. We introduce mathematical notions based on topological concepts and ergodic theory to formalize the idea of learnability of a DSR model. We formally prove that black-box DL techniques, without adequate structural priors, generally will not be able to learn a generalizing DSR model. We also show this empirically, considering major classes of DSR algorithms proposed so far, and illustrate where and why they fail to generalize across the whole phase space. Our study provides the first comprehensive mathematical treatment of OODG in DSR, and gives a deeper conceptual understanding of where the fundamental problems in OODG lie and how they could possibly be addressed in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every locally compact second countable group $G$ arises as the outer automorphism group Out $M$ of a II$_1$ factor, which was so far only known for totally disconnected groups, compact groups and a few isolated examples. We obtain this result by proving that every locally compact second countable group is a centralizer group, a class of Polish groups that arise naturally in ergodic theory and that may all be realized as Out $M$.</description>
