      <title>MetaDragonBoat: Exploring Paddling Techniques of Virtual Dragon Boating in a Metaverse Campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preservation of cultural heritage, as mandated by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is integral to sustainable urban development. This paper focuses on the Dragon Boat Festival, a prominent event in Chinese cultural heritage, and proposes leveraging Virtual Reality (VR), to enhance its preservation and accessibility. Traditionally, participation in the festival's dragon boat races was limited to elite athletes, excluding broader demographics. Our proposed solution, named MetaDragonBoat, enables virtual participation in dragon boat racing, offering immersive experiences that replicate physical exertion through a cultural journey. Thus, we build a digital twin of a university campus located in a region with a rich dragon boat racing tradition. Coupled with three paddling techniques that are enabled by either commercial controllers or physical paddle controllers with haptic feedback, diversified users can engage in realistic rowing experiences. Our results demonstrate that by integrating resistance into the paddle controls, users could simulate the physical effort of dragon boat racing, promoting a deeper understanding and appreciation of this cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>The algorithmic nature of song-sequencing: statistical regularities in music albums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a review of anecdotal beliefs, we explored patterns of track-sequencing within professional music albums. We found that songs with high levels of valence, energy and loudness are more likely to be positioned at the beginning of each album. We also found that transitions between consecutive tracks tend to alternate between increases and decreases of valence and energy. These findings were used to build a system which automates the process of album-sequencing. Our results and hypothesis have both practical and theoretical applications. Practically, sequencing regularities can be used to inform playlist generation systems. Theoretically, we show weak to moderate support for the idea that music is perceived in both global and local contexts.</description>

      <title>MM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an emerging and intriguing problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting with large language models. Compared to using text or graph modalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event forecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in two key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting, and 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To answer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions that images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named MM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset MidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast can correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating these verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting performance. The dataset, code, and prompts are available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/MM-Forecast.</description>

      <title>Emotional Cues Extraction and Fusion for Multi-modal Emotion Prediction and Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion Prediction in Conversation (EPC) aims to forecast the emotions of forthcoming utterances by utilizing preceding dialogues. Previous EPC approaches relied on simple context modeling for emotion extraction, overlooking fine-grained emotion cues at the word level. Additionally, prior works failed to account for the intrinsic differences between modalities, resulting in redundant information. To overcome these limitations, we propose an emotional cues extraction and fusion network, which consists of two stages: a modality-specific learning stage that utilizes word-level labels and prosody learning to construct emotion embedding spaces for each modality, and a two-step fusion stage for integrating multi-modal features. Moreover, the emotion features extracted by our model are also applicable to the Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) task. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance on both IEMOCAP and MELD datasets.</description>

      <title>MultiColor: Image Colorization by Learning from Multiple Color Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep networks have shown impressive performance in the image restoration tasks, such as image colorization. However, we find that previous approaches rely on the digital representation from single color model with a specific mapping function, a.k.a., color space, during the colorization pipeline. In this paper, we first investigate the modeling of different color spaces, and find each of them exhibiting distinctive characteristics with unique distribution of colors. The complementarity among multiple color spaces leads to benefits for the image colorization task.
  We present MultiColor, a new learning-based approach to automatically colorize grayscale images that combines clues from multiple color spaces. Specifically, we employ a set of dedicated colorization modules for individual color space. Within each module, a transformer decoder is first employed to refine color query embeddings and then a color mapper produces color channel prediction using the embeddings and semantic features. With these predicted color channels representing various color spaces, a complementary network is designed to exploit the complementarity and generate pleasing and reasonable colorized images. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>MU-MAE: Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of multimedia data, leveraging multimodal sensors presents a promising approach for improving accuracy in human activity recognition. Nevertheless, accurately identifying these activities using both video data and wearable sensor data presents challenges due to the labor-intensive data annotation, and reliance on external pretrained models or additional data. To address these challenges, we introduce Multimodal Masked Autoencoders-Based One-Shot Learning (Mu-MAE). Mu-MAE integrates a multimodal masked autoencoder with a synchronized masking strategy tailored for wearable sensors. This masking strategy compels the networks to capture more meaningful spatiotemporal features, which enables effective self-supervised pretraining without the need for external data. Furthermore, Mu-MAE leverages the representation extracted from multimodal masked autoencoders as prior information input to a cross-attention multimodal fusion layer. This fusion layer emphasizes spatiotemporal features requiring attention across different modalities while highlighting differences from other classes, aiding in the classification of various classes in metric-based one-shot learning. Comprehensive evaluations on MMAct one-shot classification show that Mu-MAE outperforms all the evaluated approaches, achieving up to an 80.17% accuracy for five-way one-shot multimodal classification, without the use of additional data.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale and Detail-Enhanced Segment Anything Model for Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Salient Object Detection (SOD) aims to identify and segment the most prominent objects in images. Advanced SOD methods often utilize various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Transformers for deep feature extraction. However, these methods still deliver low performance and poor generalization in complex cases. Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed as a visual fundamental model, which gives strong segmentation and generalization capabilities. Nonetheless, SAM requires accurate prompts of target objects, which are unavailable in SOD. Additionally, SAM lacks the utilization of multi-scale and multi-level information, as well as the incorporation of fine-grained details. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Multi-scale and Detail-enhanced SAM (MDSAM) for SOD. Specifically, we first introduce a Lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter (LMSA), which allows SAM to learn multi-scale information with very few trainable parameters. Then, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Module (MLFM) to comprehensively utilize the multi-level information from the SAM's encoder. Finally, we propose a Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) to incorporate SAM with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model on multiple SOD datasets and its strong generalization on other segmentation tasks.

      <title>Edit As You Wish: Video Caption Editing with Multi-grained User Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically narrating videos in natural language complying with user requests, i.e. Controllable Video Captioning task, can help people manage massive videos with desired intentions. However, existing works suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the control signal is single-grained which can not satisfy diverse user intentions; 2) the video description is generated in a single round which can not be further edited to meet dynamic needs. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{C}aption \textbf{E}diting \textbf{(VCE)} task to automatically revise an existing video description guided by multi-grained user requests. Inspired by human writing-revision habits, we design the user command as a pivotal triplet \{\textit{operation, position, attribute}\} to cover diverse user needs from coarse-grained to fine-grained. To facilitate the VCE task, we \textit{automatically} construct an open-domain benchmark dataset named VATEX-EDIT and \textit{manually} collect an e-commerce dataset called EMMAD-EDIT. We further propose a specialized small-scale model (i.e., OPA) compared with two generalist Large Multi-modal Models to perform an exhaustive analysis of the novel task. For evaluation, we adopt comprehensive metrics considering caption fluency, command-caption consistency, and video-caption alignment. Experiments reveal the task challenges of fine-grained multi-modal semantics understanding and processing. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available at https://github.com/yaolinli/VCE.</description>

      <title>Learning Domain-Invariant Features for Out-of-Context News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-context news is a common type of misinformation on online media platforms. This involves posting a caption, alongside a mismatched news image. Existing out-of-context news detection models only consider the scenario where pre-labeled data is available for each domain, failing to address the out-of-context news detection on unlabeled domains (e.g. news topics or agencies). In this work, we therefore focus on domain adaptive out-of-context news detection. In order to effectively adapt the detection model to unlabeled news topics or agencies, we propose ConDA-TTA (Contrastive Domain Adaptation with Test-Time Adaptation) which applies contrastive learning and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to learn domain-invariant features. In addition, we leverage test-time target domain statistics to further assist domain adaptation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms baselines in most domain adaptation settings on two public datasets, by as much as 2.93% in F1 and 2.08% in accuracy.</description>

      <title>GaussianForest: Hierarchical-Hybrid 3D Gaussian Splatting for Compressed Scene Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of novel-view synthesis has recently witnessed the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting, which represents scenes in a point-based manner and renders through rasterization. This methodology, in contrast to Radiance Fields that rely on ray tracing, demonstrates superior rendering quality and speed. However, the explicit and unstructured nature of 3D Gaussians poses a significant storage challenge, impeding its broader application. To address this challenge, we introduce the Gaussian-Forest modeling framework, which hierarchically represents a scene as a forest of hybrid 3D Gaussians. Each hybrid Gaussian retains its unique explicit attributes while sharing implicit ones with its sibling Gaussians, thus optimizing parameterization with significantly fewer variables. Moreover, adaptive growth and pruning strategies are designed, ensuring detailed representation in complex regions and a notable reduction in the number of required Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian-Forest not only maintains comparable speed and quality but also achieves a compression rate surpassing 10 times, marking a significant advancement in efficient scene modeling. Codes will be available at https://github.com/Xian-Bei/GaussianForest.</description>

      <title>SynopGround: A Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding from TV Dramas and Synopses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video grounding is a fundamental problem in multimodal content understanding, aiming to localize specific natural language queries in an untrimmed video. However, current video grounding datasets merely focus on simple events and are either limited to shorter videos or brief sentences, which hinders the model from evolving toward stronger multimodal understanding capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a large-scale video grounding dataset named SynopGround, in which more than 2800 hours of videos are sourced from popular TV dramas and are paired with accurately localized human-written synopses. Each paragraph in the synopsis serves as a language query and is manually annotated with precise temporal boundaries in the long video. These paragraph queries are tightly correlated to each other and contain a wealth of abstract expressions summarizing video storylines and specific descriptions portraying event details, which enables the model to learn multimodal perception on more intricate concepts over longer context dependencies. Based on the dataset, we further introduce a more complex setting of video grounding dubbed Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding (MPVG), which takes as input multiple paragraphs and a long video for grounding each paragraph query to its temporal interval. In addition, we propose a novel Local-Global Multimodal Reasoner (LGMR) to explicitly model the local-global structures of long-term multimodal inputs for MPVG. Our method provides an effective baseline solution to the multi-paragraph video grounding problem. Extensive experiments verify the proposed model's effectiveness as well as its superiority in long-term multi-paragraph video grounding over prior state-of-the-arts. Dataset and code are publicly available. Project page: https://synopground.github.io/.</description>
