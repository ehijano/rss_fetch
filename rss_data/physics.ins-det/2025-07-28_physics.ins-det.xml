      <title>Development and performance evaluation of a water-based liquid scintillator tracking detector with wavelength-shifting fiber readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a novel tracking detector utilizing a water-based liquid scintillator (WbLS) for the accurate characterization of neutrino interactions on a water target. In this detector, the WbLS is optically segmented into small cells by reflective separators, and the scintillation light is read out in three directions using wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers. We developed and optimized WbLS samples for this application and measured their light yield using cosmic-ray muons. Subsequently, we constructed a prototype of the WbLS tracking detector and evaluated its performance with a positron beam. The beam test demonstrated good tracking performance, although the light yield was lower than required. The result prompted a review of the surfactant used in the WbLS and the material of the optical separators, leading to a significant improvement in light yield. In this paper, we report on a design of the WbLS tracking detector, the development of the WbLS, the results of the beam test, and subsequent improvements to the WbLS and optical separators.</description>

      <title>Design and Mechanical Integration of Scintillation Modules for SUB-Millicharge ExperimenT (SUBMET)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of the detector design for the SUB-Millicharge ExperimenT (SUBMET), developed to search for millicharged particles. The experiment probes a largely unexplored region of the charge-mass parameter space, focusing on particles with mass $m_\chi &lt; 1.6~\textrm{GeV}/c^2$ and electric charge $Q &lt; 10^{-3}e$. The detector has been optimized to achieve high sensitivity to interactions of such particles while maintaining effective discrimination against background events. We provide a comprehensive overview of the key detector components, including scintillation modules, photomultiplier tubes, and the mechanical support structure.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Efficiency Calculator (MaLBEC) for Nuclear Fusion Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostics are critical for commercial and research fusion machines, since measuring and understanding plasma features is important to sustaining fusion reactions. The neutron flux (and therefore fusion power) can be indirectly calculated using neutron activation analyses, where potentially large numbers of activation foils are placed in the neutron flux, and delayed gammas from key reactions are measured via gamma spectrometry. In gamma spectrometry, absolute efficiency forms part of the activity calculation, and equals to the ratio of the total number of photons detected to the number emitted by a radioactive sample. Hence, it is imperative that they are calculated efficiently and accurately. This paper presents a novel digital efficiency calculation algorithm, the Machine Learning Based Efficiency Calculator (MaLBEC), that uses state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques to calculate efficiency values of a given sample, from only four inputs. In this paper, the performance of the MaLBEC is demonstrated with a fusion sample and compares the values to a traditional efficiency calculation method, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP). The efficiencies from the MaLBEC were within an average 5\% of the ones produced by MCNP, but with an exceptional reduction in computation time of 99.96\%. When the efficiency values from both methods were used in the activity calculation, the MaLBEC was within 3\% of the MCNP results.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution femtosecond electron diffraction reveals electronic and nuclear dynamics at conical intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conical intersections play a pivotal role in excited-state quantum dynamics. Capturing transient molecular structures near conical intersections remains challenging due to the rapid timescales and subtle structural changes involved. We overcome this by combining the enhanced temporal resolution of mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction with a super-resolution real-space inversion algorithm, enabling visualization of nuclear and electronic motions at conical intersections with sub-angstrom resolution, surpassing the diffraction limit. We apply this technique to the textbook example of the ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which proceeds through two conical intersections within 100 femtoseconds. The super-resolved transient structures near conical intersections reveal a C-C bond length difference of less than 0.4 angstrom and an approximately 30-femtosecond traversal time of the nuclear wave packet between them. These findings establish super-resolution ultrafast scattering as a transformative tool for uncovering quantum dynamics in molecules and open new avenues for studying light-matter interactions at the most fundamental level.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <title>Operation of a dual-phase xenon detector with wavelength sensitivity from ultraviolet to infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Xenon, in both its gaseous and liquid phase, offers excellent scintillation and ionization properties, making it an ideal target medium for rare event searches. We report on measurements performed with a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber sensitive to wavelengths from 170 nm to 1700 nm. In addition to the well-established ultraviolet (UV) scintillation, we observe coincident signals in a photomultiplier tube sensitive to infrared (IR) light, associated with both prompt scintillation in the liquid and electroluminescence in the gas. We study the time response of the IR signals and their dependence on the applied amplification field in the gas. Our findings support the observation of IR emission from electroluminescence and reveal a time response distinct from that previously reported for $\alpha$-particles in gas. The results suggest that IR scintillation could provide enhanced signal identification and background rejection in future xenon-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Lateral Amorphous Selenium Photodetectors for Low-Photon and VUV Detection at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) as a cryogenic photodetector material is evaluated through a series of experiments using laterally structured devices operated in a custom optical test stand. These studies investigate the response of a-Se detectors to low-photon fluxes at high electric fields near avalanche conditions, the linearity of the photoconductive response over a wide dynamic range and the direct detection of narrowband 130 nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) illumination. At 87 K, matched-filter analysis shows reliable single-shot detection with efficiencies greater than or equal to 80 percent and area under the curve (AUC) greater than or equal to 0.85 using as few as approximately 6800 incident 401 nm photons, corresponding to approximately 3400 photons within field-active regions after accounting for geometric constraints. Measurements are performed at cryogenic temperatures using calibrated photon fluxes derived from a silicon photomultiplier reference and a characterized optical filter stack. Additional experiments using a tellurium-doped a-Se (a-SeTe) device explore the material's behavior under identical test conditions and demonstrate that avalanche is achievable in a-SeTe at cryogenic temperatures. The results demonstrate reproducible low-noise operation, VUV sensitivity and field-dependent gain behavior in a lateral a-Se architecture, representing the first reported observation of avalanche multiplication in laterally structured a-Se and a-SeTe devices at cryogenic temperatures. These findings support the potential integration of laterally structured a-Se devices into next-generation pixelated liquid-argon time projection chambers (TPCs) requiring scalable, high-field-compatible photon detection systems.</description>
