      <title>Complexity-entropy analysis of solar photospheric turbulence: Hinode images of magnetic and Poynting fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal inhomogeneous-homogeneous transition in the dynamics and structures of solar photospheric turbulence is studied by applying the complexity-entropy analysis to Hinode images of a vortical region of supergranular junctions in the quiet Sun. During a period of supergranular vortex expansion of 37.5 min, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the line-of-sight magnetic field and the horizontal electromagnetic energy flux display the characteristics of inverse turbulent cascade, evidenced by the formation of a large magnetic coherent structure via the merger of two small magnetic elements trapped by a long-duration vortex. Both magnetic and Poynting fluxes exhibit an admixture of chaos and stochasticity in the complexity-entropy plane, involving a temporal transition from low to high complexity and a temporal transition from high to low entropy during the period of vortex expansion, consistent with Hinode observations.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>
