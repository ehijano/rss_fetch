      <title>Recent methods from statistical inference and machine learning to improve integrative modeling of macromolecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17894v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrative modeling of macromolecular assemblies allows for structural characterization of large assemblies that are recalcitrant to direct experimental observation. A Bayesian inference approach facilitates combining data from complementary experiments along with physical principles, statistics of known structures, and prior models, for structure determination. Here, we review recent methods for integrative modeling based on statistical inference and machine learning. These methods improve over the current state-of-the-art by enhancing the data collection, optimizing coarse-grained model representations, making scoring functions more accurate, sampling more efficient, and model analysis more rigorous. We also discuss three new frontiers in integrative modeling: incorporating recent deep learning-based methods, integrative modeling with in situ data, and metamodeling.</description>

      <title>Decoding How Proteins Fold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling and unsolved challenges in molecular biology is understanding how proteins fold. Despite having advanced predictive tools that can accurately estimate the native structures of proteins, we still lack a comprehensive model that explains how amino acid sequences dictate folding pathways and trajectories. This manuscript takes a fresh approach to this problem by resorting to the principle of least action. This approach enables us to explore an intriguing question: how does a protein achieve its native state at a constant folding rate and within a time frame that is biologically plausible? A response to this inquiry will help us understand why proteins must fold along specific pathways and identify the boundary conditions that restrict their availability. It will also clarify why different folding pathways could be characterized by a common effective folding trajectory. Finally, it will provide a clear explanation for Levinthal's paradox. Our results are expected to pave the way for a more profound understanding of how proteins fold, shedding light on how the amino acid sequence and its surrounding environment encode the protein's folding pathways and, consequently, the protein's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Water to Pressure and Cold Denaturation of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.07594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</description>
