      <title>A priori estimates and Liouville-type theorems for the semilinear parabolic equations involving the nonlinear gradient source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the local and global properties of nonnegative solutions for semilinear heat equation $u_t-\Delta u=u^p+M|\nabla u|^q$ in $\Omega\times I\subset \R^N\times \R$, where $M&gt;0$, and $p,q&gt;1$. We first establish the local pointwise gradient estimates when $q$ is subcritical, critical and supercritical with respect to $p$. With these estimates, we can prove the parabolic Liouville-type theorems for time-decreasing ancient solutions. Next, we use Gidas-Spruck type integral methods to prove the Liouville-type theorem for the entire solutions when $q$ is critical. Finally, as an application of the Liouville-type theorem, we use the doubling lemma to derive universal priori estimates for local solutions of parabolic equations with general nonlinearities. Our approach relies on a parabolic differential inequality containing a suitable auxiliary function rather than Keller-Osserman type inequality, which allows us to generalize and extend the partial results of the elliptic equation (Bidaut-V\'{e}ron, Garcia-Huidobro and V\'{e}ron (2020) \cite{veron-sum}) to the parabolic case.</description>

      <title>Fractional Laplace operator and related Schr\"odinger equations on locally finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first define a discrete version of the fractional Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^{s}$ through the heat semigroup on a stochastically complete, connected, locally finite graph $G = (V, E, \mu, w)$. Secondly, we define the fractional divergence and give another form of $(-\Delta)^s$. The third point, and the foremost, is the introduction of the fractional Sobolev space $W^{s,2}(V)$, which is necessary when we study problems involving $(-\Delta)^{s}$. Finally, using the mountain-pass theorem and the Nehari manifold, we obtain multiplicity solutions to a discrete fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equation on $G$. We caution the readers that though these existence results are well known in the continuous case, the discrete case is quite different.</description>

      <title>Regularity for the Boltzmann equation conditional to pressure and moment bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that solutions to the Boltzmann equation without cut-off satisfying pointwise bounds on some observables (mass, pressure, and suitable moments) enjoy a uniform bound in $L^\infty$ in the case of hard potentials. As a consequence, we derive $C^{\infty}$ estimates and decay estimates for all derivatives, conditional to these macroscopic bounds. Our $L^\infty$ estimates are uniform in the limit $s \nearrow 1$ and hence we recover the same results also for the Landau equation.</description>

      <title>A variational formulation of a Multi-Population Mean Field Games with non-local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a MFG model with quadratic Hamiltonian involving $N$ populations. This results in a system of $N$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and $N$ Fokker-Planck equations with non-local interactions. As in the classical case we introduce an Eulerian variational formulation which, despite the non convexity of the interaction, still gives a weak solution to the MFG model. The problem can be reformulated in Lagrangian terms and solved numerically by a Sinkhorn-like scheme. We present numerical results based on this approach, these simulations exhibit different behaviours depending on the nature (repulsive or attractive) of the non-local interaction.</description>

      <title>Propagation phenomena for a reaction-diffusion-advection model in a heterogeneous environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to propagation phenomena for a reaction-diffusion-advection equation in a heterogeneous environment with KPP-bistable nonlinearities. A comprehensive analysis is presented on the influence of advection and heterogeneous reactions, based on various values of the advection rate $c$. When $c&gt;-c_m$, it is demonstrated that propagation can always occur with leftward spreading speed $c_m+c$ and righward spreading speed $\min\big(\max(c_b-c,0),c_m-c\big)$, where $c_m$ and $c_b$ are respectively the spreading speeds of KPP reaction and bistable reaction. Moreover, a logarithmic delay of the level sets in the left direction is discovered. When $c\le -c_m$, propagation phenomena are determined by the initial data and by the sign of $c_b$. In particular, when $c_b&gt;0$, the leftward propagation speed is $c_b+c$ if the initial population is ``large enough''; whereas extinction occurs if the initial value is located in the bistable region and is ``relatively small''. In addition, the attractiveness of the bistable traveling wave is obtained when the leftward spreading speed is $c_b+c$ and/or when the rightward spreading speed is $c_b-c$.</description>

      <title>Low energy resolvent asymptotics of the multipole Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute low energy asymptotics for the resolvent of the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles for both integer and non-integer total fluxes. For integral total flux we reduce to prior results in black-box scattering while for non-integral total flux we build on the corresponding techniques using an appropriately chosen model resolvent. The resolvent expansion can be used to obtain long-time wave asymptotics for the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles. An interesting phenomenon is that if the total flux is an integer then the scattering resembles even-dimensional Euclidean scattering, while if it is half an odd integer then it resembles odd-dimensional Euclidean scattering. The behavior for other values of total flux thus provides an `interpolation' between these.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general abstract theorem deducing wave expansions as time goes to infinity from resolvent expansions as energy goes to zero, under an assumption of polynomial boundedness of the resolvent at high energy. We give applications to obstacle scattering, to Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonians, to scattering in a sector, and to scattering by a compactly supported potential.</description>

      <title>A three population Lotka-Volterra competition model with two populations interacting through an interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider three species competing with each other in the same habitat. One of the species lives in the entire habitat, competing with the other two species, while the other two inhabit two disjoint regions of the habitat. These two populations just interact on a region/interface which acts as a geographical barrier. This barrier condition causes a drastic change in species behaviour compared to the classical Lotka-Volterra competitive model, showing very rich and new different situations depending on the several parameters involved in the system.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates of the fractional to the local Dirichlet problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove non-asymptotic rates of convergence in the $W^{s,2}(\mathbb R^d)$-norm for the solution of the fractional Dirichlet problem to the solution of the local Dirichlet problem as $s\uparrow 1$. For regular enough boundary values we get a rate of order $\sqrt{1-s}$, while for less regular data the rate is of order $\sqrt{(1-s)|\log(1-s)|}$. We also obtain results when the right hand side depends on $s$, and our error estimates are true for all $s\in(0,1)$. The proofs use variational arguments to deduce rates in the fractional Sobolev norm from energy estimates between the fractional and the standard Dirichlet energy.</description>

Abstract: This article generalizes the results of [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 512 (2022), Article No. 126075], which presented a theory of distributions (generalized functions) with a singular curve contained in the domain of the test functions. In this present article we construct a theory of distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with a ``thick submanifold'', that is, a new theory of thick distributions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose domain contains a submanifold on which test functions may be singular.</description>

      <title>Viability for locally monotone evolution inclusions and lower semicontinuous solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for viability of evolution inclusions with locally monotone operators in the sense of Liu and R\"ockner [J. Funct. Anal., 259 (2010), pp. 2902-2922]. This allows us to prove wellposedness of lower semicontinuous solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated to the optimal control of evolution inclusions. Thereby, we generalize results in Bayraktar and Keller [J. Funct. Anal., 275 (2018), pp. 2096-2161] on Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite dimensions with monotone operators in several ways. First, we permit locally monotone operators. This extends the applicability of our theory to a wider class of equations such as Burgers' equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. Second, we allow state constraints. Third, we have uniqueness of viscosity solutions. Our results on viability and lower semicontinuous solutions are new even in the case of monotone operators.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for $C^2$ long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb R^d$, $d\ge 2$, with $C^2$ long-range potentials. This extends former results in the literature, in particular [Is1, Is2, II, GY], which all require a higher degree of smoothness. In this sense the spirit of our paper is similar to [H\"o2, Chapter XXX], which also develops a scattering theory under the $C^2$ condition, however being very different from ours. While the Agmon-H\"ormander theory is based on the Fourier transform, our theory is not and may be seen as more related to our previous approach to scattering theory on manifolds [IS1,IS2,IS3]. The $C^2$ regularity is natural in the Agmon-H\"ormander theory as well as in our theory, in fact probably being `optimal' in the Euclidean setting. We prove equivalence of the stationary and time-dependent theories by giving stationary representations of associated time-dependent wave operators. Furthermore we develop a related stationary scattering theory at fixed energy in terms of asymptotics of generalized eigenfunctions of minimal growth. A basic ingredient of our approach is a solution to the eikonal equation constructed from the geometric variational scheme of [CS]. Another key ingredient is strong radiation condition bounds for the limiting resolvents originating in [HS]. They improve formerly known ones [Is1, Sa] and considerably simplify the stationary approach. We obtain the bounds by a new commutator scheme whose elementary form allows a small degree of smoothness.</description>

      <title>A spectral method for dispersive solutions of the nonlocal Sine-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moved by the pressing need for rigorous and reliable numerical tools for the analysis of peridynamic materials, the authors propose a model able to capture the dispersive features of nonlocal soliton like solutions obtained by a peridynamic formulation of the Sine-Gordon equation. The analysis of the Cauchy problem associated to the peridynamic Sine Gordon equation with local Neumann boundary condition is performed in this work through a spectral method on Chebyshev polynomials nodes joined with the Stormer Verlet scheme for the time evolution. The choice for using the spectral method resides in the resulting reachable numerical accuracy, while, indeed, Chebyshev polynomials allow straightforward implementation of local boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are proposed for thoroughly describe the ability of such scheme. Specifically, dispersive effects as well as the ability of preserving the internal energy of the specific peridynamic kernel are demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we consider area minimizing currents in the general setting of arbitrary codimension and arbitrary boundary multiplicity. We study the boundary regularity of 2d area minimizing currents, beyond that, several results are stated in the more general context of $(C_0, \alpha_0, r_0)$-almost area minimizing currents of arbitrary dimension $m$ and arbitrary codimension taking the boundary with arbitrary multiplicity. Furthermore, we do not consider any type of convex barrier assumption on the boundary, in our main regularity result which states that the regular set, which includes one-sided and two-sided points, of any 2d area minimizing current $T$ is an open dense set in the boundary.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Strichartz estimates in Schatten classes and their applications to the Hartree equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems in the context of randomization. Frank, Lewin, Lieb, and Seiringer first proved the orthonormal Strichartz estimates. After that, many authors have studied this type of inequality. In this paper, we introduce two randomizations of operators and show that they allow us to treat strictly bigger Schatten exponents than the sharp exponents of the deterministic orthonormal Strichartz estimates. In the proofs, the orthogonality does not have any essential role, and randomness works instead of it. We also prove that our randomizations of operators never change the Schatten classes to which they originally belong. Moreover, we give some applications of our results to the Hartree and linearized Hartree equation for infinitely many particles. First, we construct local solutions to the Hartree equation with initial data in wide Schatten classes. By only using deterministic orthonormal Strichartz estimates, it is impossible to give any solution in our settings. Next, we consider the scattering problem of the linearized Hartree equation. One of our randomizations allows us to treat wide Schatten classes with some Sobolev regularities, and by the other randomization, we can remove all Sobolev regularities.</description>

      <title>Systems of parabolic equations with delays: Continuous dependence on parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results on continuous dependence on parameters, as well as on regularization, of solutions to linear systems of parabolic partial differential equations of second order with delay are given. One of the main features is that the topology on the zero order and delay coefficients is the weak-* topology on an $L_{\infty}$ space, whereas the assumptions on the second- and first-order coefficients are slightly stronger. This is important in the context of generation of linear skew-product dynamical systems by such equations.</description>

      <title>The Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the first eigenvalue of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator and log-concavity of the relevant eigenfunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the first (nontrivial) Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator $$ L(u)=\Delta u-\langle\nabla u,x\rangle\,, $$ as a function of the domain, is convex with respect to the Minkowski addition, and we characterize the equality cases in some classes of convex sets. We also prove that the corresponding (positive) eigenfunction is log-concave if the domain is convex.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>
