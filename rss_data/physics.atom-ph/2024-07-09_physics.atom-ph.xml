      <title>Cavity QED in a High NA Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From fundamental studies of light-matter interaction to applications in quantum networking and sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a platform-crossing toolbox to control interactions between atoms and photons. The coherence of such interactions is determined by the product of the single-pass atomic absorption and the number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting nearly 1-million optical roundtrips at the expense of severely limited optical material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. The single-pass absorption probability can be increased through the use of near-concentric, fiber or nanophotonic cavities, which reduce the mode waists at the expense of constrained optical access and exposure to surface fields. Here we present a new high numerical-aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom-single-photon absorption probability per round trip close to its fundamental limit by reducing the mode size at the atom below a micron while keeping the atom mm-to-cm away from all optics. This resonator provides strong light-matter coupling in a cavity where the light circulates only ~ 10 times. We load a single 87Rb atom into such a cavity, observe strong coupling, demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with imaging fidelity of 99.55(6) percent and survival probability of 99.89(4) percent in 130 microseconds, and leverage this new platform for a time-resolved exploration of cavity cooling. The resonator's loss-resilience paves the way to coupling of atoms to nonlinear and adaptive optical elements and provides a minimally invasive route to readout of defect centers. Introduction of intra-cavity imaging systems will enable the creation of cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, vastly expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Exact Two-Component Coupled-Cluster Study of Molecular Sensitivity Factors for Nuclear Schiff Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic exact two-component coupled-cluster calculations of molecular sensitivity factors for nuclear Schiff moments (NSMs) are reported. We focus on molecules containing heavy nuclei, especially octupole-deformed nuclei. Analytic relativistic coupled-cluster gradient techniques are used and serve as useful tools for identifying candidate molecules that sensitively probe for physics beyond the Standard Model in the hadronic sector. Notably, these tools enable straightforward ``black-box'' calculations. Two competing chemical mechanisms that contribute to the NSM are analyzed, illuminating the physics of ligand effects on NSM sensitivity factors.</description>

      <title>Continuous broadband Rydberg receiver using AC Stark shifts and Floquet States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the continuous broadband microwave receivers based on AC Stark shifts and Floquet States of Rydberg levels in a cesium atomic vapor cell. The resonant transition frequency of two adjacent Rydberg states 78$S_{1/2}$ and 78$P_{1/2}$ is tuned based on AC Stark effect of 70~MHz Radio frequency (RF) field that is applied outside the vapor cell. Meanwhile, the Rydberg states also exhibit Floquet even-order sidebands that are used to extend the bandwidths further. We achieve microwave electric field measurements over 1.172~GHz of continuous frequency range. The sensitivity of the Rydberg receiver with heterodyne technique in the absence of RF field is 280.2~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, while it is dramatically decreased with tuning the resonant transition frequency in the presence of RF field. Surprisingly, the sensitivity can be greatly improved if the microwave field couples the Floquet sideband transition. The achieving of continuous frequency and high sensitivity microwave detection will promote the application of Rydberg receiver in the radar technique and wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop measurement in atom interferometer gyroscope with velocity-dependent phase dispersion compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometer-based gyroscopes are expected to have a wide range of applications due to their high sensitivity. However, their dynamic range is limited by dephasing caused by velocity-dependent Sagnac phase shift in combination with the velocity distribution of the atoms, restricting measurements of large angular velocities. In this study, we present a method for restoring the contrast deterioration in rotation rate measurements with interferometer gyroscopes using atomic beams. Our findings confirm that by introducing the pseudo-rotation effect with appropriate two-photon detunings for Raman lights in the interferometer, it is possible to effectively cancel the rotation of all atoms in the velocity distribution of the beam. Consequently, the contrast is unaffected by the rotation. Furthermore, we applied this method to an interferometer gyroscope with counterpropagating atomic beams sharing the same Raman lights. We also found that the rotation rate of the system can be estimated through the detunings points where the phase difference between the two interferometers is zero. This approach ensures that the scale factor of the atom interferometer gyroscope is independent of the velocity fluctuation of the atomic beam. We demonstrate our technique using the interferometer gyroscope of thermal atomic beams of rubidium-87, achieving a measurement of rotation rate of $\mathrm{{1.0}^{\circ}/s}$ even with an acceleration of 0.68$\mathrm{m/s^2}$ on a three-axis rotation table. This simple and robust dispersion compensation method with Raman light detuning benefits dynamic rotation-rate measurements in field applications such as the inertial navigation of vehicles.</description>

      <title>Faraday laser pumped cesium beam clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a high-performance compact optically pumped cesium beam clock using Faraday laser simultaneously as pumping and detection lasers. The Faraday laser, which is frequency stabilized by modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) technique, has narrow linewidth and superior frequency stability. Measured by optical heterodyne method between two identical systems, the linewidth of the Faraday laser is 2.5 kHz after MTS locking, and the fractional frequency stability of the Faraday laser is optimized to $1.8\times{10}^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$. Based on this high-performance Faraday laser, the cesium beam clock realizes a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in 1 Hz bandwidth of $39600$ when the cesium oven temperature is 130{\deg}C. Frequency-compared with Hydrogen maser, the fractional frequency stability of the Faraday laser pumped cesium beam clock can reach $1.3\times{10}^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$ and drops to $1.4\times{10}^{-14}$ at 10000 s when the cesium oven temperature is 110{\deg}C. %, which is the best reported result compared with other cesium beam clocks. This Faraday laser pumped cesium beam clock demonstrates its excellent performance, and its great potential in the fields of timekeeping, navigation, and communication. Meanwhile, the Faraday laser, as a high-performance optical frequency standard, can also contribute to the development of other applications in quantum metrology, precision measurement and atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of microscopic physical systems is a prerequisite for experimental quantum science and its applications. Neutral atomic and molecular systems can be controlled using tunable scattering resonances. However, the resonant control of effective interactions has so far been limited to the ultracold regime, where quantum effects become manifest. Ultracold temperatures are still out of reach for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems, a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we show that magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances can be used to control inelastic collisions between a single trapped Sr${}^+$ ion and Rb atoms high above the ultracold regime. We measure inelastic collision probabilities and use the results to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. The observed collision dynamics show signatures of quantum interference, resulting in the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates in the multiple-partial-wave regime. With our model, we discover multiple measurable Feshbach resonances for magnetic fields from 0 to 400 G, which allow significant enhancement of spin-exchange rates at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of the predicted resonances should allow precise calibration and control of the short-range dynamics in the ${\text{Sr}^++\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02481v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of experimentally investigating the inherently dual properties of a supersolid, a simultaneous superfluid and solid, has become more critical following the recent experimental evidence for supersolids in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{164}\text{Dy}$. We introduce a supersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to simultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and superfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing technology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in dipolar BECs. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex correlations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it from superfluidity. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex trajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids arising from their dynamics and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Robust double Bragg diffraction via detuning control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new theoretical model and numerical optimization of double Bragg diffraction (DBD), a widely used technique in atom interferometry. We derive an effective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the so-called "quasi-Bragg regime", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers operate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to account for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we investigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double Bragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control. Notably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency exceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an artificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing enhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This protocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite momentum width of 0.05$\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range of up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Vector Atom Accelerometry in an Optical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate two multidimensional atom interferometers capable of measuring both the magnitude and direction of applied inertial forces. These interferometers do not rely on the ubiquitous light-pulses of traditional atom sensors, but are instead built from an innovative design that operates entirely within the Bloch bands of an optical lattice formed by interfering laser beams. Through time-dependent control of the position of the lattice in three-dimensional space, we realize simultaneous Bloch oscillations in two dimensions, and a vector atomic Michelson interferometer. Fits to the observed Bloch oscillations demonstrate the measurement of an applied acceleration of $2g$ along two axes, where $g$ is the average gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface. For the Michelson interferometer, we perform Bayesian inferencing from a 49-channel output by repeating experiments for selected examples of two-axis accelerations. We demonstrate the resulting accuracy and sensitivity for vector parameter estimation. Our acceleration can be measured from a single experimental run and does not require repeated shots to construct a fringe. We find the performance of our device to be near the quantum limit for the interferometer size and quantum detection efficiency of the atoms. We discuss the reconfigurability of the vector accelerometer and the pathway toward further sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Recombination of Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combined experimental and theoretical study is carried out on the three-body recombination process in a gas of microwave-shielded polar molecules. For ground-state polar molecules dressed with a strong microwave field, field-linked bound states can appear in the intermolecular potential. We model three-body recombination into such bound states using classical trajectory calculations. Our results show that recombination can explain the enhanced loss rates observed at small microwave detunings in trapped samples of bosonic NaCs [Bigagli, $\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Phys. $\textbf{19}$ 1579-1584 (2023)]. Specifically, our calculations reproduce the experimentally measured three-body loss rates across a wide range of microwave Rabi couplings, detunings, and temperatures. This work suggests that for bosonic shielded molecular systems in which the two-body loss is sufficiently suppressed and a field-linked bound state is present, the dominant loss process will be three-body recombination.</description>

      <title>Observation of Space-Dependent Rotational Doppler Shifts with a Single Ion Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experiment investigating the rotational Doppler effect using a single trapped ion excited by two copropagating vortex laser beams. The setup isolates the azimuthal gradients of the fields, eliminating longitudinal and curvature effects. We provide a detailed characterization of the phenomenon by deterministically positioning a single ion across the beams, achieving a signal which depends on the angular velocity of the ion and the difference of optical orbital angular momentum between the two beams. The interpretation of the measurements is supported by numerical simulations and by a simplified analytical model. Our results reveal key properties of the rotational Doppler effect, showing that it increases approaching the center of the beam and that it is independent of the waist of the beam. This offers insights into the feasibility of super-kicks or super-Doppler shifts for sensing and manipulating atomic motion transverse to the beams' propagation direction.</description>

      <title>Leggett-Garg Inequality for Bosons in a Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as postulated by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impracticality of noninvasive measurements. In this work, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-Condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>Realizing fracton order from long-range quantum entanglement in programmable Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Storing quantum information, unlike information in a classical computer, requires battling quantum decoherence, which results in a loss of information over time. To achieve error-resistant quantum memory, one would like to store the information in a quantum superposition of degenerate states engineered in such a way that local sources of noise cannot change one state into another, thus preventing quantum decoherence. One promising concept is that of fracton order -- a phase of matter with a large ground state degeneracy that grows subextensively with the system size. Unfortunately, the models realizing fractons are not friendly to experimental implementations as they require unnatural interactions between a substantial number (of the order of ten) of qubits. We demonstrate how this limitation can be circumvented by leveraging the long-range quantum entanglement created using only pairwise interactions between the code and ancilla qubits, realizable in programmable tweezer arrays of Rydberg atoms. We show that this platform also allows to detect and correct certain types of errors en route to the goal of true error-resistant quantum memory.</description>

      <title>In vacuum metasurface for optical microtrap array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled and individual controlled particles have revolutionized the atomic, molecular and optical physics, and they afford exquisite capabilities for applications in quantum simulation of many-body physics, quantum computation and quantum sensing. Underlying this development is the technical maturity of generating scalable optical beams, enabled by active components and high numerical aperture objective. However, such a complex combination of bulk optics outside the vacuum chamber is very sensitive to any vibration and drift. Here we demonstrate the generation of 3*3 static tweezer array with a single chip-scale multifunctional metasurface element in vacuum, replacing the meter-long free space optics. Fluorescence counts on the camera validates the successfully trapping of the atomic ensemble array. Further, we discuss the strategy to achieve low scattering and crosstalk, where a metasurface design featuring dual-wavelength independent control is included. Our results, together with other recent development in integrated photonics for cold atoms, could pave the way for compact and portable quantum sensors and simulators in platforms of neutral atom arrays.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

      <title>New bounds on heavy axions with an X-ray free electron laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{4} eV. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3^rd generation synchrotron [1], our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <title>Delayed Electron-Ion Entanglement Revealed with Zero Area Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grobe--Eberly doublet phenomenon occurs in photoelectron distributions when the remaining ion is dressed by a field. As was recently shown, the doublet can be interpreted as a signature of quantum entanglement between photoelectrons and strongly coupled ions. However, the dressed state nature of the ion prevents detection of the entanglement by straightforward coincidence detection. Here, we find that odd (zero-area) envelopes can substantially delay the generation of entanglement, but also modify the dynamics such that the doublet transforms into unique channel-resolved photoelectron distributions. Because these distributions can be used to correlate with the internal state of the ion, our proposed scheme opens up for detection of quantum entanglement, between photoelectrons and stongly-coupled ions, without a need for quantum phase measurements.</description>
