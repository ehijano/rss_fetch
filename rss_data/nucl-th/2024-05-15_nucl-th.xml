      <title>Relativistic Guiding-Center Motion: Action Principle, Kinetic Theory, and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a non-uniform external Maxwell field using a manifestly Lorentz covariant action principle which easily reproduces the known Vandervoort equations of motion. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that this hydrodynamics applies more generally than the kinetic theory, e.g., for strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Possible explanation of the irregular energy dependence of the rapidity width of $\phi$ mesons observed in Pb+Pb collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental data from the NA49 collaboration show an unexpectedly steep rise of the rapidity width of the $\phi$ meson as function of beam energy, which was suggested as possible interesting signal for novel physics. In this work we show that the Ultra-relativistic Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics (UrQMD) model is able to reproduce the shapes of the rapidity distributions of most measured hadrons and predicts a common linear increase of the width for all hadrons. Only when following the exact same analysis technique and experimental acceptance of the NA49 and NA61/SHINE collaborations, we find that the extracted value of the rapidity width of the $\phi$ increases drastically for the highest beam energy. We conclude that the observed steep increase of the $\phi$ rapidity width is a problem of limited detector acceptance and the simplified Gaussian fit approximation.</description>

      <title>Production cross sections of superheavy elements: insights from the dinuclear system model with high-quality microscopic nuclear masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To accurately predict the synthesis cross-sections of superheavy elements, identifying the optimal projectile-target combinations and the evaporation channels at specific collision energies, we have attempted to utilize high-quality microscopic nuclear masses (HQMNM) within the dinuclear system (DNS) model, which are obtained by fitting experimental data with the Skyrme energy density functional theory (DFT), as published in Phys. Lett. B 851 (2024) 138578. The atomic nuclear mass serves as a crucial input for the DNS model, as the Q-values and separation energies it generates directly influence the calculated fusion and survival probabilities. Our calculations have reproduced the experimental data for hot fusion and have been compared with results based on the finite-range droplet model (FRDM12) mass calculations. Compared to the FRDM12 mass results, we have found that the HQMNM provides a better fit to the experimental outcomes. For the specific reaction of \(^{48}\rm{Ca} + ^{243}\rm{Am} \rightarrow ^{291}\rm{Mc}^*\), we have conducted a detailed calculation of capture, fusion, and survival based on the HQMNM model and compared these with calculations based on other mass models. Based on these findings, we have systematically calculated available projectile target combinations for the synthesis of elements 119 and 120, and identified the optimal combinations. We provided the synthesis cross-sections, collision energies, and evaporation channels, offering a reference for conducting experiments on the synthesis of superheavy elements.</description>

      <title>Microscopic investigation of wobbling motion in atomic nuclei using the triaxial projected shell model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic investigation of the wobbling band structures observed in odd-mass nuclei of $^{161,163,165,167}$Lu, $^{167}$Ta $^{131}$Cs, $^{135}$Pr, $^{151}$Eu, $^{183}$Au, $^{133}$Ba, $^{105}$Pd, $^{133}$La, $^{187}$Au and $^{127}$Xe is performed using the triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach. It is demonstrated that all the studied band structures have transverse wobbling mode, except for $^{133}$La, $^{187}$Au (negative parity), $^{183}$Au (positive parity) and $^{127}$Xe nuclei where the wobbling frequency increases with spin, indicating that the collective motion has a longitudinal character. To elucidate further the wobbling nature of the band structures, electromagnetic transition probabilities have been evaluated and it is observed that inter-band transitions are dominated by $E2$ rather than $M1$ as expected for a typical signature partner band. It is shown that TPSM approach provides a reasonable description of all the measured properties of the studied nuclei.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Structure of Quark-Gluon Plasma Unveiled Through Nuclear Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is hindered by our limited understanding of its initial conditions, particularly its longitudinal structure. We propose a novel approach that entails analyzing collisions involving nuclei of similar masses but different deformations. This strategy allows us to vary the initial conditions and collective expansion of the QGP, while minimizing the influence of non-flow correlations. Using a dynamical transport model, we have for the first time extracted the complete longitudinal structure of elliptic flow ($v_2$). Our findings reveal that although deformation significantly enhances the overall magnitude of $v_2$, it does not alter its longitudinal profile. This approach not only enables the separation of the rapidity dependence of flow from its rapidity decorrelations but also prompts further investigation into other nuclear structural features, such as nuclear skin thickness, to advance our understanding of the QGP's initial conditions.</description>

      <title>An Area Law for Entanglement Entropy in Particle Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering cross section is the effective area of collision when two particles collide. Quantum mechanically, it is a measure of the probability for a specific process to take place. Employing wave packets to describe the scattering process, we compute the entanglement entropy in 2-to-2 scattering of particles in a general setting using the $S$-matrix formalism. Applying the optical theorem, we show that the linear entropy $\mathcal{E}_2$ is given by the elastic cross section $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ in unit of the transverse size $L^2$ of the wave packet, $\mathcal{E}_2 \sim \sigma_{\text{el}}/L^2$, when the initial states are not entangled. The result allows for dual interpretations of the entanglement entropy as an area and as a probability. Since $\sigma_{\text{el}}$ is generally believed, and observed experimentally, to grow with the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$ in the high energy regime, the result suggests a "second law" of entanglement entropy for high energy collisions. Furthermore, the Froissart bound places an upper limit on the entropy growth.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>The effective field theory of extended Wilson lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the effective theory of electrically charged, spatially extended, infinitely heavy objects at leading power. The theory may be viewed as a generalization of NRQED for particles with a finite charge distribution where the charge radius and higher moments of the charge distribution are counted as $O(1)$ rather than $O(1/M)$. We show this is equivalent to a Wilson line traced by the worldline of an extended charge distribution. Our canonical use case is atomic nuclei with large charge $Z\gg 1$. The theory allows for the insertion of external operators and is sufficiently general to allow a treatment of both electromagnetic and weak mediated lepton-nucleus scattering including charged-current processes. This provides a first step towards the factorization of Coulomb regions, including structure dependence arising from a finite charge distribution, for scattering with nuclei.</description>

      <title>Deep TOV to characterize Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations, theoretical models, and terrestrial experiments probe different regions of neutron star (NS) interior. Therefore, it is essential to consistently combine the information from these sources. This analysis requires multiple evaluations of Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations which can become computationally expensive with a large number of observations. Further, multi-messenger astronomy requires rapid NS characterization via gravitational waves for efficient electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we develop a novel neural network-based map from the EoS curve to the mass and radius of cold non-rotating NS. We estimate a speed-up of an order of magnitude when compared with the state-of-the-art RePrimAnd solver and an average error of 1e-3 when calculating the mass and radius of the neutron star. Additionally, we also develop neural network solvers for obtaining EoS curves from a physics conforming EoS model, FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$. We utilize this efficient continuous map to measure the sensitivity of model parameters of FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$ towards mass and radius. We show that 8 out of 18 parameters of this model are sensitive by at least three orders of magnitude higher than the remaining 10 parameters. This information will be useful in further speeding up, as well as probing the crucial parameter space, in the parameter estimation from astrophysical observations using this physics-conforming EoS model.</description>

      <title>Towards Quarkonium Fragmentation from NRQCD in a Variable-Flavor Number Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address quarkonium formation at moderate to large transverse momenta, where the single-parton collinear fragmentation prevails over the short-distance emission, directly from the hard sub-scattering, of the constituent heavy-quark pair. We rely on Non-Relativistic-QCD (NRQCD) Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) calculations for all parton fragmentation channels to quarkonia, taken as proxies for initial-scale inputs. Preliminary sets of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions (FFs) are built via a DGLAP scheme that properly accounts for evolution thresholds. Statistical errors are assessed via a Monte Carlo (MC), replica-like approach aimed at catching Missing Higher-Order Uncertainties (MHOUs).</description>

      <title>General amplitude of near-threshold hadron scattering for exotic hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the general behavior of the scattering amplitude with channel couplings near the two-body threshold. It is known that the Flatt\'{e} amplitude, which is often used in the analysis of experimental data involving exotic hadrons, has some constraint in the near-threshold energy region. While the M-matrix gives the general expression of the scattering amplitude, it is not smoothly connected to the Flatt\'{e} amplitude, due to the property of the determinant of the amplitude in channel space. In this paper, based on the effective field theory, we propose new parametrization of the scattering amplitude which gives the general expression near the threshold and has a well-defined limit reproducing the Flatt\'{e} amplitude. We show that the nonresonant background contribution exists in the general amplitude even in the first order in the momentum. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the cross sections by changing the strength of the background contribution. We find that the interference with the background term may induce a dip structure of the cross section near the threshold, in addition to the peak and threshold cusp structures.</description>

Here, we discuss such recent applications, including analyticity constraints on hadronic cross sections, radiative corrections, and isospin-breaking effects.</description>

      <title>The TDHF code Sky3D version 1.2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sky3D code has been widely used to describe nuclear ground states, collective vibrational excitations, and heavy-ion collisions. The approach is based on Skyrme forces or related energy density functionals. The static and dynamic equations are solved on a three-dimensional grid, and pairing is been implemented in the BCS approximation. This updated version of the code aims to facilitate the calculation of nuclear strength functions in the regime of linear response theory, while retaining all existing functionality and use cases. The strength functions are benchmarked against available RPA codes, and the user has the freedom of choice when selecting the nature of external excitation (from monopole to hexadecapole and more). Some utility programs are also provided that calculate the strength function from the time-dependent output of the dynamic calculations of the Sky3D code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear structure at short $NN$-distances is still poorly understood. In particular, the full quantum structure of the nucleus with a correlated $NN$-pair is a challenge to theory. So far, model descriptions have been limited to the average mean-field picture of the remaining nuclear system after removing the $NN$-pair. In the recent experiment of the BM@N Collaboration at JINR \cite{Patsyuk:2021fju}, the reactions $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2pn_s)^{10}\mbox{B}$ and $^{12}\mbox{C}(p,2pp_s)^{10}\mbox{Be}$ induced by the hard elastic $pp$ scattering were studied. Here, $n_s$ or $p_s$ denote the undetected slow nucleon in the rest frame of $^{12}\mbox{C}$. In contrast to the previous experiments, the residual bound nucleus was also detected which requires a new level of theoretical understanding. In the present work, we apply the technique of fractional parentage coefficients of the translationally-invariant shell model (TISM) to calculate the spectroscopic amplitude of the system $NN-B$ where $B$ is the remaining nuclear system. The spectroscopic amplitude enters the full amplitude of a nuclear reaction. The relative $NN-B$ wave function is no longer a free parameter of the model but is uniquely related to the internal state of $B$. The interaction of the target proton with the $NN$-pair is considered in the impulse approximation. We also include the initial- and final state interactions of absorptive type as well as the single charge exchange processes. Our calculations are in a reasonable agreement with the BM@N data.</description>

      <title>Prediction of two-neutron halos in the $N=28$ isotones $^{40}$Mg and $^{39}$Na</title>

Abstract: The ground states of the nuclei $^{40}$Mg and $^{39}$Na are investigated using the hyperspherical formalism. Since they are located at the edge of the "big island of inversion", we concentrate on whether we are likely to find two-neutron Borromean halos in these nuclei. A three-body model with effective $n$-$n$ and $^{38}$Mg$+n$ interactions is built for $^{40}$Mg based on the available data. We also give predictions for the low-lying spectrum of $^{38}$Na$=^{37}$Na$+n$ and two-neutron separation energy of the $^{39}$Na nucleus. Depending on parameter choice, we report an increase in the matter radii in the range $0.1$-$0.5$ fm relative to those of the core nuclei. The results suggest a two-neutron halo structure in $^{40}$Mg for a subset of parameters, reinforcing the prediction of a Borromean halo nucleus. The calculations indicate that a two-neutron halo is even more likely for $^{39}$Na. As expected, the halo is linked to the disappearance of the shell gap in these nuclei due to the inversion of the $2p_{3/2}$ and $1f_{7/2}$ orbitals. We study the total cross section for scattering of these nuclei from a carbon target using a Glauber model and show that these provide a clear signal to assess the halo structure.</description>

      <title>Accurate and precise quantum computation of valence two-neutron systems</title>

Abstract: Developing methods to solve nuclear many-body problems with quantum computers is an imperative pursuit within the nuclear physics community. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to accurately and precisely compute the ground state of valence two-neutron systems leveraging presently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. Our focus lies on the nuclei having a doubly-magic core plus two valence neutrons in the $ p $, $ sd $, and $ pf $ shells, i.e. ${}^6$He, ${}^{18}$O, and ${}^{42}$Ca, respectively. Our ansatz, quantum circuit, is constructed in the pair-wise form, taking into account the symmetries of the system in an explicit manner, and enables us to reduce the number of qubits and the number of CNOT gates required. The results on a real quantum hardware by IBM Quantum Platform show that the proposed method gives very accurate results of the ground-state energies, which are typically within $ 0.1 \, \% $ error in the energy for ${}^6$He and ${}^{18}$O and at most $ 1 \, \% $ error for ${}^{42}$Ca. Furthermore, our experiments using real quantum devices also show the pivotal role of the circuit layout design, attuned to the connectivity of the qubits, in mitigating errors.</description>

      <title>Towards the quark mass dependence of $T_{cc}^+$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts in the $T_{cc}^+=cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel are extracted from lattice QCD for five different charm quark masses and a fixed light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\simeq 280$~MeV. The phase shifts are analysed employing two approaches: effective range expansion and Lippmann--Schwinger equation derived in the effective field theory. In the latter case, the results imply an attraction at short range parametrised by contact terms and a slight repulsion at long range mediated by one-pion exchange with $m_\pi &gt;m_{D^*}-m_D$. The poles in the amplitude across the complex energy plane are extracted and their trajectories are discussed as the charm quark mass is varied. Two complex conjugate poles corresponding to a resonance below threshold are found for $m_c$ close to the physical value. They turn into a pair of virtual states at the largest $m_c$ studied. With further increasing $m_c$, one virtual pole representing $T_{cc}^+$ is expected to move towards the two-body threshold and turn into a bound state. The light-quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}^+$ pole is briefly discussed using the data on $DD^*$ scattering from other lattice collaborations.</description>

      <title>Baryonic Vortex Phase and Magnetic Field Generation in QCD with Isospin and Baryon Chemical Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel baryonic vortex phase in low energy dense QCD with finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. It is known that the homogeneous charged pion condensate emerges as a ground state at finite isospin chemical potential, and therein arises the Abrikosov vortex lattice with an applied magnetic field. We first demonstrate that a vortex with the same quantized magnetic flux as the conventional Abrikosov vortex, carries a baryon number captured by the third homotopy group of Skyrmions, once we take into account a modulation of the neutral pion inside the vortex core. Such a vortex-Skyrmion state is therefore dubbed the baryonic vortex. We further reveal that when the baryon chemical potential is above a critical value, the baryonic vortex has negative tension measured from the charged pion condensation. It implies that the phase, in which such vortices emerge spontaneously without an external magnetic field, would take over the ground state at high baryon density. Such a new phase contributes to the comprehension of QCD phase diagram and relates to the generation of magnetic fields inside neutron stars.</description>
