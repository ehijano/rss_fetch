      <title>On a question of Gundersen-Yang concerning entire solutions of binomial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question posed by G. Gundersen and C. C. Yang, in which the following two types of binomial differential equations are investigated, $$ a(z)f'f''-b(z)(f)^{2}=c(z)e^{2d(z)},~~a(z)ff'-b(z)(f'')^{2}=c(z)e^{2d(z)}, $$ where $a(z)$, $b(z)$ and $c(z)$ are polynomials such that $a(z)b(z)c(z)\not\equiv 0$, $d(z)$ is non-constant polynomial. The explicit forms of entire solutions of the above binomial differential equations are obtained by using the Nevanlinna theory, which gives partial solutions to the question of G. Gundersen and C. C. Yang. In addition, some examples are given to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps on thick part of moduli spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study spectral gaps of closed hyperbolic surfaces for large genus. We show that for any fixed $k\geq 1$, as the genus goes to infinity, the maximum of $\lambda_k-\lambda_{k-1}$ over any thick part of the moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces approaches the limit $\frac{1}{4}$.</description>

      <title>Factorization of solutions linear differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper supplements recents results on linear differential equations $f''+Af=0$, where the coefficient $A$ is analytic in the unit disc of the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. It is shown that, if $A$ is analytic and $|A(z)|^2(1-|z|^2)^3\, dm(z)$ is a Carleson measure, then all non-trivial solutions of $f''+Af=0$ can be factorized as $f=Be^g$, where $B$ is a Blaschke product whose zero-sequence $\Lambda$ is uniformly separated and where $g\in{\rm BMOA}$ satisfies the interpolation property $$g'(z_n) = -\frac{1}{2} \, \frac{B''(z_n)}{B'(z_n)}, \quad z_n\in\Lambda.$$ Among other things, this factorization implies that all solutions of $f''+Af=0$ are functions in a Hardy space and have no singular inner factors.
  Zero-free solutions play an important role as their maximal growth is similar to the general case. The study of zero-free solutions produces a new result on Riccati differential equations.</description>

      <title>Dunkl approach to slice regular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that a Clifford algebra valued function is slice if and only if it is in the kernel of Dunkl-spherical Dirac operator and a slice function $f$ is slice regular if and only if it is in the kernel of the Dunkl-Cauchy-Riemann operator of a certain parameter. Based on this observation and the inverse Dunkl intertwining operator, we present a new approach to construct a family of classical monogenic functions from a given holomorphic function.</description>

      <title>Value distribution of meromorphic mappings on complete K\"ahler connected sums with non-parabolic ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All harmonic functions on $\mathbb C^m$ possess Liouville's property, which is well-known as the Liouville's theorem. In 1979, Kuz'menko and Molchanov discovered a phenomenon that the Liouville's property is not rigid for some harmonic functions on the connected sum $\mathbb C^m\#\mathbb C^m,$ where there exist a large number of non-constant bounded harmonic functions. This discovery motivates us to explore conditions under which harmonic functions possess Liouville's property. In this paper, we discuss the value distribution of meromorphic mappings from complete K\"ahler connected sums with non-parabolic ends into complex projective manifolds. Under a geometric condition, we establish a second main theorem in Nevanlinna theory. As a consequence, we prove that the Cauchy-Riemann equation ensures the rigidity of Liouville's property for harmonic functions if such connected sums satisfy a volume growth condition.</description>

      <title>Complex variable solution on asymmetrical sequential shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial considering static equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetrical sequential excavation is common in shallow tunnel engineering, especially for large-span tunnels. Owing to the lack of necessary conformal mappings, existing complex variable solutions on shallow tunnelling are only suitable for symmetrical cavities, and can not deal with asymmetrical sequential tunnelling effectively. This paper proposes a new complex variable solution on asymmetrical sequential shallow tunnelling by incorporating a bidirectional conformal mapping scheme consisting of Charge Simulation Method and Complex Dipole Simulation Method. Moreover, to eliminate the far-field displacement singularity of present complex variable method, a rigid static equilibrium mechanical model is established by fixing the far-field ground surface to equilibriate the nonzero resultant along cavity boundary due to gravitational shallow tunnelling. The corresponding mixed boundary conditions along ground surface are transformed into homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problems with extra constraints of traction along cavity boundaries, which are solved in an iterative manner to obtain reasonable stress and displacement fields of asymmetrical sequential shallow tunnelling. The proposed solution is validated by sufficient comparisons with equivalent finite element solution with good agreements. The comparisons also suggest that the proposed solution should be more accurate than the finite element one. A parametric investigation is finally conducted to illustrate possible practical applications of the proposed solution with several engineering recommendations. Additionally, the theoretical improvements and defects of the proposed solution are discussed for objectivity.</description>

      <title>Some Gaussianity criteria for Khinchin families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we establish simple and verifiable analytical conditions for a power series f in the class K, and its associated Khinchin family, to be Gaussian. We give several moment criteria for general power series with non-negative coefficients in K and also provide several applications of these criteria.</description>
