      <title>MARS: Multi-sample Allocation through Russian roulette and Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple importance sampling (MIS) is an indispensable tool in rendering that constructs robust sampling strategies by combining the respective strengths of individual distributions.Its efficiency can be greatly improved by carefully selecting the number of samples drawn from each distribution, but automating this process remains a challenging problem.Existing works are mostly limited to mixture sampling, in which only a single sample is drawn in total, and the works that do investigate multi-sample MIS only optimize the sample counts at a per-pixel level, which cannot account for variations beyond the first bounce.Recent work on Russian roulette and splitting has demonstrated how fixed-point schemes can be used to spatially vary sample counts to optimize image efficiency but is limited to choosing the same number of samples across all sampling strategies.Our work proposes a highly flexible sample allocation strategy that bridges the gap between these areas of work.We show how to iteratively optimize the sample counts to maximize the efficiency of the rendered image using a lightweight data structure, which allows us to make local and individual decisions per technique.We demonstrate the benefits of our approach in two applications, path guiding and bidirectional path tracing, in both of which we achieve consistent and substantial speedups over the respective previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>LoDAvatar: Hierarchical Embedding and Adaptive Levels of Detail with Gaussian Splatting for Enhanced Human Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of virtual reality, the demand for 3D human avatars is increasing. The emergence of Gaussian Splatting technology has enabled the rendering of Gaussian avatars with superior visual quality and reduced computational costs. Despite numerous methods researchers propose for implementing drivable Gaussian avatars, limited attention has been given to balancing visual quality and computational costs. In this paper, we introduce LoDAvatar, a method that introduces levels of detail into Gaussian avatars through hierarchical embedding and selective detail enhancement methods. The key steps of LoDAvatar encompass data preparation, Gaussian embedding, Gaussian optimization, and selective detail enhancement. We conducted experiments involving Gaussian avatars at various levels of detail, employing both objective assessments and subjective evaluations. The outcomes indicate that incorporating levels of detail into Gaussian avatars can decrease computational costs during rendering while upholding commendable visual quality, thereby enhancing runtime frame rates. We advocate adopting LoDAvatar to render multiple dynamic Gaussian avatars or extensive Gaussian scenes to balance visual quality and computational costs.</description>

      <title>GL-NeRF: Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Enables Training-Free NeRF Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volume rendering in neural radiance fields is inherently time-consuming due to the large number of MLP calls on the points sampled per ray. Previous works would address this issue by introducing new neural networks or data structures. In this work, We propose GL-NeRF, a new perspective of computing volume rendering with the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. GL-NeRF significantly reduces the number of MLP calls needed for volume rendering, introducing no additional data structures or neural networks. The simple formulation makes adopting GL-NeRF in any NeRF model possible. In the paper, we first justify the use of the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and then demonstrate this plug-and-play attribute by implementing it in two different NeRF models. We show that with a minimal drop in performance, GL-NeRF can significantly reduce the number of MLP calls, showing the potential to speed up any NeRF model.</description>

      <title>SCube: Instant Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction using VoxSplats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SCube, a novel method for reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes (geometry, appearance, and semantics) from a sparse set of posed images. Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat, which is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates high-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians with a 1024^3 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views. We show the superiority of SCube compared to prior art using the Waymo self-driving dataset on 3D reconstruction and demonstrate its applications, such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and Digital Image Processing (DIP) with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are popular research areas in Computer Vision and related fields. We highlight transformative applications in image enhancement, filtering techniques, and pattern recognition. By integrating frameworks like the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Z-Transform, and Fourier Transform methods, we enable robust data manipulation and feature extraction essential for AI-driven tasks. Using Python, we implement algorithms that optimize real-time data processing, forming a foundation for scalable, high-performance solutions in computer vision. This work illustrates the potential of ML and DL to advance DSP and DIP methodologies, contributing to artificial intelligence, automated feature extraction, and applications across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Conditional GAN for Enhancing Diffusion Models in Efficient and Authentic Global Gesture Generation from Audios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven simultaneous gesture generation is vital for human-computer communication, AI games, and film production. While previous research has shown promise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by issues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on diffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the denoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise added at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise values are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving differential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the noise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating generation. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step denoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original data distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the generated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we break the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising speed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture audio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising distribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling step, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for high-speed generation.</description>

      <title>Lodge++: High-quality and Long Dance Generation with Vivid Choreography Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Lodge++, a choreography framework to generate high-quality, ultra-long, and vivid dances given the music and desired genre. To handle the challenges in computational efficiency, the learning of complex and vivid global choreography patterns, and the physical quality of local dance movements, Lodge++ adopts a two-stage strategy to produce dances from coarse to fine. In the first stage, a global choreography network is designed to generate coarse-grained dance primitives that capture complex global choreography patterns. In the second stage, guided by these dance primitives, a primitive-based dance diffusion model is proposed to further generate high-quality, long-sequence dances in parallel, faithfully adhering to the complex choreography patterns. Additionally, to improve the physical plausibility, Lodge++ employs a penetration guidance module to resolve character self-penetration, a foot refinement module to optimize foot-ground contact, and a multi-genre discriminator to maintain genre consistency throughout the dance. Lodge++ is validated by extensive experiments, which show that our method can rapidly generate ultra-long dances suitable for various dance genres, ensuring well-organized global choreography patterns and high-quality local motion.</description>

      <title>DHPrep: Deep Hawkes Process based Dynamic Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks representation aims to encode vertices into a low-dimensional space, while preserving the original network structures and properties. Most existing methods focus on static network structure without considering temporal dynamics. However, in real world, most networks (e.g., social and biological networks) are dynamic in nature and are constantly evolving over time. Such temporal dynamics are critical in representations learning, especially for predicting dynamic networks behaviors. To this end, a Deep Hawkes Process based Dynamic Networks Representation algorithm (DHPrep) is proposed in this paper, which is capable of capturing temporal dynamics of dynamic networks. Specifically, DHPrep incorporates both structural information and temporal dynamics to learn vertices representations that can model the edge formation process for a vertex pair, where the structural information is used to capture the historical impact from their neighborhood, and the temporal dynamics utilize this historical information and apply Hawkes point process to model the edges formation process. Moreover, a temporal smoother is further imposed to ensure the representations evolve smoothly over time. To evaluate the effectiveness of DHPrep, extensive experiments are carried out using four real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal that our DHPrep algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in various tasks including link prediction and vertices recommendation.</description>

      <title>Skinned Motion Retargeting with Dense Geometric Interaction Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing and maintaining geometric interactions among different body parts is crucial for successful motion retargeting in skinned characters. Existing approaches often overlook body geometries or add a geometry correction stage after skeletal motion retargeting. This results in conflicts between skeleton interaction and geometry correction, leading to issues such as jittery, interpenetration, and contact mismatches. To address these challenges, we introduce a new retargeting framework, MeshRet, which directly models the dense geometric interactions in motion retargeting. Initially, we establish dense mesh correspondences between characters using semantically consistent sensors (SCS), effective across diverse mesh topologies. Subsequently, we develop a novel spatio-temporal representation called the dense mesh interaction (DMI) field. This field, a collection of interacting SCS feature vectors, skillfully captures both contact and non-contact interactions between body geometries. By aligning the DMI field during retargeting, MeshRet not only preserves motion semantics but also prevents self-interpenetration and ensures contact preservation. Extensive experiments on the public Mixamo dataset and our newly-collected ScanRet dataset demonstrate that MeshRet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Incomplete Gamma Kernels: Generalizing Locally Optimal Projection Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present incomplete gamma kernels, a generalization of Locally Optimal Projection (LOP) operators. In particular, we reveal the relation of the classical localized $ L_1 $ estimator, used in the LOP operator for point cloud denoising, to the common Mean Shift framework via a novel kernel. Furthermore, we generalize this result to a whole family of kernels that are built upon the incomplete gamma function and each represents a localized $ L_p $ estimator. By deriving various properties of the kernel family concerning distributional, Mean Shift induced, and other aspects such as strict positive definiteness, we obtain a deeper understanding of the operator's projection behavior. From these theoretical insights, we illustrate several applications ranging from an improved Weighted LOP (WLOP) density weighting scheme and a more accurate Continuous LOP (CLOP) kernel approximation to the definition of a novel set of robust loss functions. These incomplete gamma losses include the Gaussian and LOP loss as special cases and can be applied to various tasks including normal filtering. Furthermore, we show that the novel kernels can be included as priors into neural networks. We demonstrate the effects of each application in a range of quantitative and qualitative experiments that highlight the benefits induced by our modifications.</description>

      <title>iSeg: Interactive 3D Segmentation via Interactive Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present iSeg, a new interactive technique for segmenting 3D shapes. Previous works have focused mainly on leveraging pre-trained 2D foundation models for 3D segmentation based on text. However, text may be insufficient for accurately describing fine-grained spatial segmentations. Moreover, achieving a consistent 3D segmentation using a 2D model is highly challenging, since occluded areas of the same semantic region may not be visible together from any 2D view. Thus, we design a segmentation method conditioned on fine user clicks, which operates entirely in 3D. Our system accepts user clicks directly on the shape's surface, indicating the inclusion or exclusion of regions from the desired shape partition. To accommodate various click settings, we propose a novel interactive attention module capable of processing different numbers and types of clicks, enabling the training of a single unified interactive segmentation model. We apply iSeg to a myriad of shapes from different domains, demonstrating its versatility and faithfulness to the user's specifications.

      <title>Customizing Text-to-Image Models with a Single Image Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Art reinterpretation is the practice of creating a variation of a reference work, making a paired artwork that exhibits a distinct artistic style. We ask if such an image pair can be used to customize a generative model to capture the demonstrated stylistic difference. We propose Pair Customization, a new customization method that learns stylistic difference from a single image pair and then applies the acquired style to the generation process. Unlike existing methods that learn to mimic a single concept from a collection of images, our method captures the stylistic difference between paired images. This allows us to apply a stylistic change without overfitting to the specific image content in the examples. To address this new task, we employ a joint optimization method that explicitly separates the style and content into distinct LoRA weight spaces. We optimize these style and content weights to reproduce the style and content images while encouraging their orthogonality. During inference, we modify the diffusion process via a new style guidance based on our learned weights. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method can effectively learn style while avoiding overfitting to image content, highlighting the potential of modeling such stylistic differences from a single image pair.</description>

      <title>Unique3D: High-Quality and Efficient 3D Mesh Generation from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Unique3D, a novel image-to-3D framework for efficiently generating high-quality 3D meshes from single-view images, featuring state-of-the-art generation fidelity and strong generalizability. Previous methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) can produce diversified 3D results by distilling 3D knowledge from large 2D diffusion models, but they usually suffer from long per-case optimization time with inconsistent issues. Recent works address the problem and generate better 3D results either by finetuning a multi-view diffusion model or training a fast feed-forward model. However, they still lack intricate textures and complex geometries due to inconsistency and limited generated resolution. To simultaneously achieve high fidelity, consistency, and efficiency in single image-to-3D, we propose a novel framework Unique3D that includes a multi-view diffusion model with a corresponding normal diffusion model to generate multi-view images with their normal maps, a multi-level upscale process to progressively improve the resolution of generated orthographic multi-views, as well as an instant and consistent mesh reconstruction algorithm called ISOMER, which fully integrates the color and geometric priors into mesh results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Unique3D significantly outperforms other image-to-3D baselines in terms of geometric and textural details.</description>

Abstract: Advances in rendering have led to tremendous growth in texture assets, including resolution, complexity, and novel textures components, but this growth in data volume has not been matched by advances in its compression. Meanwhile Neural Image Compression (NIC) has advanced significantly and shown promising results, but the proposed methods cannot be directly adapted to neural texture compression. First, texture compression requires on-demand and real-time decoding with random access during parallel rendering (e.g. block texture decompression on GPUs). Additionally, NIC does not support multi-resolution reconstruction (mip-levels), nor does it have the ability to efficiently jointly compress different sets of texture channels. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to texture set compression that integrates traditional GPU texture representation and NIC techniques, designed to enable random access and support many-channel texture sets. To achieve this goal, we propose an asymmetric auto-encoder framework that employs a convolutional encoder to capture detailed information in a bottleneck-latent space, and at decoder side we utilize a fully connected network, whose inputs are sampled latent features plus positional information, for a given texture coordinate and mip level. This latent data is defined to enable simplified access to multi-resolution data by simply changing the scanning strides. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach provides much better results than conventional texture compression, and significant improvement over the latest method using neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Panoramic image stitching provides a unified, wide-angle view of a scene that extends beyond the camera's field of view. Stitching frames of a panning video into a panoramic photograph is a well-understood problem for stationary scenes, but when objects are moving, a still panorama cannot capture the scene. We present a method for synthesizing a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, as if the original video were captured with a wide-angle camera. We pose panorama synthesis as a space-time outpainting problem, where we aim to create a full panoramic video of the same length as the input video. Consistent completion of the space-time volume requires a powerful, realistic prior over video content and motion, for which we adapt generative video models. Existing generative models do not, however, immediately extend to panorama completion, as we show. We instead apply video generation as a component of our panorama synthesis system, and demonstrate how to exploit the strengths of the models while minimizing their limitations. Our system can create video panoramas for a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.</description>
