      <title>A first efficient algorithm for enumerating all the extreme points of a bisubmodular polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently enumerating all the extreme points of a polytope identified by a system of linear inequalities is a well-known challenge issue. We consider a special case and present an algorithm that enumerates all the extreme points of a bisubmodular polyhedron in $\mathcal{O}(n^4|V|)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ space complexity, where $n$ is the dimension of underlying space and $V$ is the set of outputs. We use the reverse search and signed poset linked to extreme points to avoid the redundant search. Our algorithm is a generalization of enumerating all the extreme points of a base polyhedron which comprises some combinatorial enumeration problems.</description>

      <title>Improving Data Cleaning Using Discrete Optimization</title>

Abstract: One of the most important processing steps in any analysis pipeline is handling missing data. Traditional approaches simply delete any sample or feature with missing elements. Recent imputation methods replace missing data based on assumed relationships between observed data and the missing elements. However, there is a largely under-explored alternative amid these extremes. Partial deletion approaches remove excessive amounts of missing data, as defined by the user. They can be used in place of traditional deletion or as a precursor to imputation. In this manuscript, we expand upon the Mr. Clean suite of algorithms, focusing on the scenario where all missing data is removed. We show that the RowCol Integer Program can be recast as a Linear Program, thereby reducing runtime. Additionally, the Element Integer Program can be reformulated to reduce the number of variables and allow for high levels of parallelization. Using real-world data sets from genetic, gene expression, and single cell RNA-seq experiments we demonstrate that our algorithms outperform existing deletion techniques over several missingness values, balancing runtime and data retention. Our combined greedy algorithm retains the maximum number of valid elements in 126 of 150 scenarios and stays within 1\% of maximum in 23 of the remaining experiments. The reformulated Element IP complements the greedy algorithm when removing all missing data, boasting a reduced runtime and increase in valid elements in larger data sets, over its generic counterpart. These two programs greatly increase the amount of valid data retained over traditional deletion techniques and further improve on existing partial deletion algorithms.</description>

      <title>Rigidity matroids and linear algebraic matroids with applications to matrix completion and tensor codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between problems studied in rigidity theory and matroids arising from linear algebraic constructions like tensor products and symmetric products. A special case of this correspondence identifies the problem of giving a description of the correctable erasure patterns in a maximally recoverable tensor code with the problem of describing bipartite rigid graphs or low-rank completable matrix patterns. Additionally, we relate dependencies among symmetric products of generic vectors to graph rigidity and symmetric matrix completion. With an eye toward applications to computer science, we study the dependency of these matroids on the characteristic by giving new combinatorial descriptions in several cases, including the first description of the correctable patterns in an (m, n, a=2, b=2) maximally recoverable tensor code.</description>

      <title>Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set Parameterized by Vertex Cover</title>

Abstract: For a graph $G$, a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a resolving set of $G$ if, for any two vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, there exists a vertex $w\in S$ such that $d(w,u)\neq d(w,v)$. The Metric Dimension problem takes as input a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and a positive integer $k$, and asks whether there exists a resolving set of size at most $k$. In another metric-based graph problem, Geodetic Set, the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and the objective is to determine whether there exists a subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that, for any vertex $u \in V(G)$, there are two vertices $s_1, s_2 \in S$ such that $u$ lies on a shortest path from $s_1$ to $s_2$.
  These two classical problems turn out to be intractable with respect to the natural parameter, i.e., the solution size, as well as most structural parameters, including the feedback vertex set number and pathwidth. Some of the very few existing tractable results state that they are both FPT with respect to the vertex cover number $vc$.
  More precisely, we observe that both problems admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and a kernelization algorithm that outputs a kernel with $2^{\mathcal{O}(vc)}$ vertices. We prove that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, Metric Dimension and Geodetic Set, even on graphs of bounded diameter, neither admit an FPT algorithm running in time $2^{o(vc^2)}\cdot n^{\mathcal(1)}$, nor a kernelization algorithm that reduces the solution size and outputs a kernel with $2^{o(vc)}$ vertices. The versatility of our technique enables us to apply it to both these problems.
  We only know of one other problem in the literature that admits such a tight lower bound. Similarly, the list of known problems with exponential lower bounds on the number of vertices in kernelized instances is very short.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18948v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</description>

      <title>Distance Recoloring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coloring a graph is a well known problem and used in many different contexts. Here we want to assign $k \geq 1$ colors to each vertex of a graph $G$ such that each edge has two different colors at each endpoint. Such a vertex-coloring, if exists, is called a feasible coloring of $G$. \textsc{Distance Coloring} is an extension to the standard \textsc{Coloring} problem. Here we want to enforce that every pair of distinct vertices of distance less than or equal to $d$ have different colors, for integers $d \geq 1$ and $k \geq d+1$.
  Reconfiguration problems ask if two given configurations can be transformed into each other with certain rules. For example, the well-known \textsc{Coloring Reconfiguration} asks if there is a way to change one vertex's color at a time, starting from a feasible given coloring $\alpha$ of a graph $G$ to reach another feasible given coloring $\beta$ of $G$, such that all intermediate colorings are also feasible. In this paper, we study the reconfiguration of distance colorings on certain graph classes.
  We show that even for planar, bipartite, and $2$-degenerate graphs, reconfiguring distance colorings is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete for $d \geq 2$ and $k = \Omega(d^2)$ via a reduction from the well-known \textsc{Sliding Tokens} problem. Additionally, we show that the problem on split graphs remains $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete when $d = 2$ and large $k$ but can be solved in polynomial time when $d \geq 3$ and $k \geq d+1$, and design a quadratic-time algorithm to solve the problem on paths for any $d \geq 2$ and $k \geq d+1$.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and real-world RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive stacked bonds frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in real-world RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in real-world secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>
