      <title>Acceleration of electrons and ions by an "almost" astrophysical shock in the heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shock waves, ubiquitous in the universe, are crucial for particle acceleration in various astrophysical systems. Currently, the heliosphere is the only natural environment available for their in situ study. In this work, we showcase the collective acceleration of electrons and ions by one of the fastest in situ shocks ever recorded, observed by the pioneering Parker Solar Probe at only 34.5 million kilometers from the Sun. Our analysis of this unprecedented, near-parallel shock shows electron acceleration up to 6 MeV amidst intense multi-scale electromagnetic wave emissions. We also present evidence of a variable shock structure capable of injecting and accelerating ions from the solar wind to high energies through a self-consistent process. The exceptional capability of the probe's instruments to measure electromagnetic fields in a shock traveling at 1% the speed of light has enabled us, for the first time, to confirm that the structure of a strong heliospheric shock aligns with theoretical models of strong shocks observed in astrophysical environments. This alignment offers viable avenues for understanding astrophysical shock processes and the acceleration of charged particles.</description>

      <title>planetMagFields: A Python package for analyzing and plotting planetary magnetic field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long term observations and space missions have generated a wealth of data on the magnetic fields of the Earth and other solar system planets. planetMagfields is a Python package designed to have all the planetary magnetic field data currently available in one place and to provide an easy interface to access the data. planetMagfields focuses on planetary bodies that generate their own magnetic field, namely Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Ganymede. planetMagfields provides functions to compute as well as plot the magnetic field on the planetary surface or at a distance above or under the surface. It also provides functions to filter out the field to large or small scales as well as to produce .vts files to visualize the field in 3D using Paraview, VisIt or similar rendering software. Lastly, the planetMagfields repository also provides a Jupyter notebook for easy interactive visualizations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational influence of Saturn's rings on its moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploratory missions have found that regolith on interplanetary bodies can be loosely packed and freely flowing, a state that strongly affects mission plans and that may also influence the large scale shapes of these bodies. We investigate whether notable circumferential ridges seen on Saturn's moons may be a byproduct of free flow of loosely packed regolith. Such ridges and other features likely record the history of the moons, and we find that if surface grains are freely flowing, then the combined gravity of Saturn itself and its tenuous ring generate similar circumferential features. Moreover, analysis of these features reveals the possibility of previously unreported morphologies, for example a stationary torus around a non rotating satellite. Some of these features persist even for a very low density and distant disk. This raises the prospect that nonlinear analysis of interactions from disks to moons and back again may lead to new insights.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of cosmic-ray driven Alfv\'en waves in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. I. Turbulent damping rates and feedback on background fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alfv\'en waves (AWs) excited by the cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instability (CRSI) are a fundamental ingredient for CR confinement. The effectiveness of self-confinement relies on a balance between CRSI growth rate and damping mechanisms acting on quasi-parallel AWs excited by CRs. One relevant mechanism is the so-called turbulent damping, in which an AW packet injected in pre-existing turbulence undergoes a cascade process due to its nonlinear interaction with fluctuations of the background. The turbulent damping of an AW packet in pre-existing magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is re-examined, revised, and extended to include most-recent theories of MHD turbulence that account for dynamic alignment and reconnection-mediated regime. The case in which the role of feedback of CR-driven AWs on pre-existing turbulence is important will also be discussed. Particular attention is given to the nonlinearity parameter $\chi^w$ that estimates the strength of nonlinear interaction between CR-driven AWs and background fluctuations. We point out the difference between $\chi^w$ and $\chi^z$ that instead describes the strength of nonlinear interactions between pre-existing fluctuations. When $\chi^w$ is properly taken into account, one finds that (i) the turbulent damping rate of quasi-parallel AWs in anisotropic turbulence depends on the background-fluctuations' amplitude to the third power, hence is strongly suppressed, and (ii) the dependence on the AW's wavelength (and thus on the CR gyro-radius from which it is excited) is different from what has been previously obtained. Finally, (iii) when dynamic alignment of cascading fluctuations and the possibility of a reconnection-mediated range is included in the picture, the turbulent damping rate exhibits novel regimes and breaks. Finally, a criterion for CR-feedback is derived and simple phenomenological models of CR-modified turbulent scaling are provided.</description>

      <title>Seeds and Sequences of Element Abundances in Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the small "impulsive" events, primarily accelerated during magnetic reconnection in solar jets, have strong enhancements of the abundances of increasingly heavy elements. In contrast, the shock acceleration of ambient coronal plasma in most large "gradual" SEP events produces flat or decreasing abundances vs. element mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. However, heavy-ion enhancements in the largest gradual SEP events can occur in two ways: (1) strong streaming of protons away from the shock amplifies Alfven waves that preferentially scatter and retard protons near the shock while increasingly-heavy ions can leak out, and (2) strong shock waves re-accelerate SEPs fed from persistent impulsive SEP events streaming from some active regions, with their pre-enhanced heavy ions becoming dominant. Power-law fits of abundance enhancements vs. A/Q can distinguish the latter events by the presence of both impulsive and coronal-seed components, and the best-fit charges Q define characteristic source temperatures. Intense impulsively-seeded events can occur in sequences fed from a single persistent active-region as it rotates across the disk of the Sun. Three week-long event sequences, each producing two or three very large events, occur early in the strong solar-cycle 23. The weak solar-cycle 24, produces only one impulsively-seeded event sequence - perhaps a dearth of both impulsive seeds and sufficiently strong shocks. Solar cycle 25 has produced an unusual active period of short strong impulsive events In contrast, there are other active regions where large events alternate SEPs with and without impulsively-seeded sources. We also find that events with moderate Alfven-wave trapping near the shock can release ions slowly or rapidly as a function of A/Q. This A/Q-dependent trapping acts almost as a magnetic spectrometer that separates elements in space and time.</description>
