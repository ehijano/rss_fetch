      <title>Data-driven Identification of Attractors Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we explore challenges in developing a topological framework in which machine learning can be used to robustly characterize global dynamics. Specifically, we focus on learning a useful discretization of the phase space of a flow on compact, hyperrectangle in $\mathbb{R}^n$ from a neural network trained on labeled orbit data. A characterization of the structure of the global dynamics is obtained from approximations of attracting neighborhoods provided by the phase space discretization. The perspective that motivates this work is based on Conley's topological approach to dynamics, which provides a means to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Conditions Implying Annular Chaos: Quantitative results and Computer Assisted Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive quantitative sufficient conditions for rotational chaos and diffusion in annular homeomorphisms, building on the topological criteria established in [31]. These conditions depend only on basic properties of the maps, making their implementation straightforward. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we provide computer-assisted proofs of rotational chaos and diffusion for classical families of annular maps and their variations, in both conservative (twist and non-twist) and dissipative settings.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism for a Class of Hyperbolic Transcendental Meromorphic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the thermodynamic formalism in the context of complex dynamics. We establish the thermodynamics formalism for the class of hyperbolic transcendental meromorphic functions of B-class, where the poles have bounded multiplicities, the Nevanlinna order is finite, and infinity is not an asymptotic value. We showed the existence and uniqueness of the conformal measure and the invariant Gibbs measure equivalent to the conformal measure.</description>

      <title>Weakly separated self-affine carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions of diagonally aligned self-affine carpets whose projections onto the $x$ and $y$-axes satisfy the weak separation condition. In particular, we will see that the Hausdorff dimension equals the limit of the Bara\'nski formula, and the box-counting dimension is the limit of the Feng-Wang formula taken over the $n$th level functions. We also prove various equivalent formulas for the box-counting dimension, and we provide an alternative limiting formula for Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. We demonstrate our theorems through two examples that were unobtainable previously, and we calculate their Hausdorff and box-counting dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of the Cartwright-Littlewood Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mary L. Cartwright and John E. Littlewood published a short preliminary survey in 1945 describing results of their investigation of the forced van der Pol equation \begin{equation*} \ddot{y}-k(1-y^2)\dot{y}+y = b \lambda k \cos(\lambda t+a) \end{equation*} in which $b,\lambda,k,a$ are parameters with $k$ large. Their description of dynamical behavior now known as chaos in this dissipative dynamical system was a landmark in dynamical systems theory. Littlewood's monster paper containing the details of their investigation finally appeared twelve years later in the journal Acta Mathematica. I review here the context in which Cartwright and Littlewood worked when they wrote their 1945 paper and the enduring mathematical legacy of their discoveries. I also give brief pointers to research they inspired in other application areas.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of translates of tori in arithmetic homogeneous spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be an arithmetic lattice in a noncompact connected semisimple real algebraic group. For $G$ being one of $\operatorname{SO}(n, 1)^\circ$ for $n \geq 2$, $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb R)$, $\operatorname{SL}_3(\mathbb R)$, $\operatorname{SU}(2, 1)$, $\operatorname{Sp}_4(\mathbb R)$, we prove effective equidistribution of large translates of tori in $G/\Gamma$. As an application, we obtain an asymptotic counting formula with a power saving error term for integral $3 \times 3$ matrices with a specified characteristic polynomial. These effectivize celebrated theorems of Eskin-Mozes-Shah.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic damped Burgers equation with multiplicative noise defined on the entire real line. We demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution to the stochastic damped Burgers equation and establish that the solution is uniformly bounded in time. Furthermore, by employing the uniform estimates on the tails of the solution, we obtain the tightness of a family of probability distributions of the solution. Subsequently, by applying the Krylov-Bogolioubov theorem, we establish the existence of invariant measures.</description>

      <title>On gauge transforms of autonomous ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of gauge transform has its origin in Physics (Field Theory). In the present note we discuss -- from a purely mathematical perspective -- special gauge transforms of autonomous first order ODE's and their special properties. Particular attention is given to the problem of identifying those nonautonomous ODE's which are gauge transforms of autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Global Centers and Phase Portraits in Generalized Duffing Oscillators: A Comprehensive Study of the Center-Focus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of the generalized Duffing oscillator, a fundamental model in nonlinear dynamics described by the system $$ \dot{x} = y, \quad \dot{y} = -\alpha y - \epsilon x^m - \sigma x, $$ where $\epsilon \neq 0$ and $m \geq 1$. We focus on the topological classification of phase portraits, the characterization of global centers, and the absence of limit cycles for $\alpha\neq0$. For the linear case ($m = 1$), we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the origin to be a global center, showing that this occurs if, and only if, $\alpha = 0$ and $\epsilon + \sigma &gt; 0$. For the nonlinear case ($m &gt; 1$), we prove that the origin is a global center if, and only if, $m$ is odd, $\sigma, \epsilon &gt; 0$, $\alpha = 0$. Additionally, we classify the global phase portraits for every $m$, demonstrating the rich dynamical behavior of the system and detect homoclinic, heteroclinic and double-homoclinic cycles for $\alpha=0$. Using the Bendixson-Dulac criterion, we rule out the existence of limit cycles for $\alpha\neq 0$, further clarifying the behavior of the system. Our results resolve the center-focus problem for the degenerate case $\alpha = 0$ and provide a complete characterization of global centers for generalized Duffing oscillators of odd degrees. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of nonlinear dynamical systems and have potential applications in modeling oscillatory phenomena.</description>

      <title>Extendable Shift Maps and Weighted Endomorphisms on Generalized Countable Markov Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an operator algebraic characterization for when we can continuously extend the shift map from a standard countable Markov shift $\Sigma_A$ to its respective generalized countable Markov shift $X_A$ (a compactification of $\Sigma_A$). When the shift map is continuously extendable, we obtain explicit formulas for the spectral radius of weighted endomorphisms $a\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is dual to the shift map and conjugated to $\Theta(f)=f \circ \sigma$ on $C(X_A)$, extending a theorem of Kwa\'sniewski and Lebedev from finite to countable alphabets.</description>

      <title>Periodicity in delayed self-regulation is a predator-prey process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify two different periodicity mechanisms: delayed self-regulation and planar predator-prey feedback. We consider scalar delay differential equations $\dot x(t) = rf(x(t), x(t - 1))$ where $f$ is monotone in the delayed component. Due to a Poincar\'{e}--Bendixson theorem for monotone delayed feedback systems, the typical global dynamics present periodic orbits as the delay parameter $r$ increases. In this article, we show that, as we vary the delay, each connected component of periodic orbits is an annulus with global coordinates given by the time and the amplitude of the corresponding periodic solutions. On each annulus, the variables $x(t)$ and $x(t - 1)$ solve an integrable ordinary differential equation that satisfies a predator-prey feedback relation. Moreover, we completely characterize the set of periodic solutions of the delay differential equation in terms of two time maps generated by the underlying predator-prey system.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the multiplicity and the number of limit cycles for planar piecewise linear system divided into two regions by a straight line and each linear subsystem has a node. Through constructing Poincare half maps and a successor function, and analyzing the properties of the successor function, we can derive that this system has at most two limit cycles, counting the multiplicities of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Discrete Painlev\'e equations from pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$ with branching generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the novel approach to discrete Painlev\'e equations initiated in our previous work [2]. A classification scheme for discrete Painlev\'e equations proposed by Sakai interprets them as birational isomorphisms between generalized Halphen surfaces (surfaces obtained from $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ by blowing up at eight points). Sakai's classification is thus based on the classification of generalized Halphen surfaces. In our scheme, the family of generalized Halphen surfaces is replaced by a pencil of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. A discrete Painlev\'e equation is viewed as an autonomous transformation of $\mathbb P^3$ that preserves the pencil and maps each quadric of the pencil to a different one. Thus, our scheme is based on the classification of pencils of quadrics in $\mathbb P^3$. Compared to our previous work, here we consider a technically more demanding case where the characteristic polynomial $\Delta(\lambda)$ of the pencil of quadrics is not a complete square. As a consequence, traversing the pencil via a 3D Painlev\'e map corresponds to a translation on the universal cover of the Riemann surface of $\sqrt{\Delta(\lambda)}$, rather than to a M\"obius transformation of the pencil parameter $\lambda$ as in [2].</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function. Here a Lyapunov-Reeb function means a smooth function that is proper, bounded from below and possesses only one critical point. As applications, we determine the topology of moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages by constructing Lyapunov-Reeb functions, and we prove a conjecture of Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza on moduli spaces of simple polygons. We further describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions. Finally, we present algorithms for the Carpenter's Rule Problem and several related problems.</description>

      <title>The Lie -Bianchi integrability of the full symmetric Toda system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the full symmetric Toda system is integrable in the sense of the Lie-Bianchi criterion, i.e. that there exists a solvable Lie algebra of vector fields of dimension $N=\dim M$ on the phase space $M$ of this system such that the system is invariant with respect to the action of these fields. The proof is based on the use of symmetries of the full symmetric system, which we described earlier in \cite{CSS23}, and the appearance of the structure of the stochastic Lie algebra in their description.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer theory and pseudo-Anosov flows II: Differential and Fried pants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In earlier work, relying on work of Agol-Gu\'eritaud and Landry-Minsky-Taylor, we showed that given a pseudo-Anosov flow $(Y,\phi)$ and a collection of closed orbits $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the `no perfect fit' condition, one can construct a special Heegaard diagram for the link complement $Y^\sharp= Y \setminus \nu (\mathcal{C})$ framed by the degeneracy curves. In this paper, we demonstrate how the special combinatorics of this diagram can be used to understand the differential of the associated Heegaard Floer chain complex. More specifically, we introduce a refinement of the $\text{spin}^\text{c}$-grading obstructing two Heegaard states from being connected by an effective domain. We describe explicitly the subcomplexes in the refined gradings that represent irreducible multi-orbits, in the sense that they contain states corresponding to multi-orbits which cannot be resolved along Fried pants. In particular we show that the homology of these subcomplexes are 1-dimensional. When specialized to the case of suspension flows our arguments prove some results in the spirit of Ni, Ghiggini, and Spano: the next-to-top non-zero sutured Floer group counts the number of periodic points of least period.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Zakharov-Shabat systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the solvability of the general two-dimensional Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) systems with meromorphic potentials by quadrature. These systems appear in application of the inverse scattering transform (IST) to an important class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) called integrable systems. Their solvability by quadrature is a key to obtain analytical expressions for solutions to the initial value problems of the integrable PDEs by using the IST. We prove that the ZS systems are always integrable in the sense of differential Galois theory, i.e., solvable by quadrature, if and only if the meromporphic potentials are reflectionless, under the condition that the potentials are absolutely integrable on $\mathbb{R}\setminus(-R_0,R_0)$ for some $R_0&gt;0$. Similar statements were previously proved to be true by the author for a limited class of potentials and the linear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>Irregular traces of multiple SLE(0) systems with multiple marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this supplementary note, we study the traces of multiple SLE(0) systems with two or more additional marked points.
  For general chordal configurations, the traces correspond to the real locus of real rational functions; in the radial case, they correspond to the horizontal trajectories of residue-free quadratic differentials. In both settings, we establish the regularity of the trajectories near singularities: no spiraling occurs, and no two trajectories asymptotically converge to the same direction.
  Moreover, in the radial case with non-zero spin at the marked interior point, we show that the spin induces a spiraling behavior at the marked interior point.
  However, this regularity breaks down when multiple interior marked points are present. In such cases, trajectories may asymptotically approach the same direction, and spiraling can occur even in the absence of spin. We present explicit counterexamples generated using MATLAB, with code provided for reference.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit algebraic example of a subshift of finite type over a group $\Gamma$ with an invariant Markov measure which has completely positive sofic entropy (with respect to `most' sofic approximations) and yet does not have a direct Bernoulli factor, because its model spaces shatter into exponentially many clusters of sub-exponential size. The example and its analysis are related to random low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>A characterization of physical measures for systems with mixed central behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the existence of physical measures for $C^\infty$ smooth instances of certain partially hyperbolic dynamics, both continuous and discrete, exhibiting mixed behavior (positive and negative Lyapunov exponents) along the central non-uniformly hyperbolic multidimensional invariant direction, is equivalent to the existence of certain types of ``regular points'' on positive volume subsets, including Lyapunov regular points. This encompasses the $C^3$ robust class of multidimensional non-hyperbolic attractors obtained by Viana, and the $C^1$ robust classes of $3$-sectionally hyperbolic wild strange attractors presented by Shilnikov and Turaev, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of ergodic hyperbolic physical measures on these and other dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Abstract Continuity Theorem for the Lyapunov Exponents of linear cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents for general linear cocycles when the base measures vary in Wasserstein distance, under the assumption of uniform large deviations type (LDT) estimates. This is a measure version of the abstract continuity theorem (ACT) established by Duarte-Klein [Duarte, P. and Klein, S. (2016). Lyapunov exponents of linear cocycles: Continuity via large deviations. Atlantis Studies in Dynamical Systems, 3]. The main obstacle here lies in the fact that the magnitude of the exceptional sets in LDT estimates is constantly changing when the base measures deviate. We overcome this via a combination of a Urysohn-type lemma and properties of Wasserstein distance in every iteration step. Our measure version of ACT, combined with the original work of Duarte-Klein, provides a complete scheme for proving joint H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents with respect to both measure and fiber which resolves all parameter dependence. This continuity theorem is general and applicable to a wide range of mathematical models, including product of random matrices and cocycles essentially generated by shifts. In particular, it applies to associated Schr\"odinger operators which are central objects in the study of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>On groups of diffeomorphisms of the interval with finitely many fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:1503.03852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [13], it is proved that any subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}^{\omega }(I)$ (the group of orientation preserving analytic diffeomorphisms of the interval) is either metaabelian or does not satisfy a law. A stronger question is asked whether or not the Girth Alternative holds for subgroups of $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}^{\omega }(I)$. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively for even a larger class of groups of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the interval where every non-identity element has finitely many fixed points. We show that every such (irreducible) group is either affine (in particular, metaabelian) or has infinite girth. The proof is based on our study of discrete subgroups of the diffeomorphism group $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}(I)$ which we initiated in [9] and later developed in [1] and [2]; more specifically, our results are obtained by sharpening the tools from the earlier works [1] and [2]. One of the major tools (local transitivity) is heavily exploited in [2] to get an extension of Holders theorem which is crucially used in this paper. We show that local transitivity can be proved for any (up to a conjugacy) non-affine group of irreducible diffeomorphisms with every non-identity element having finitely many fixed points.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Controlling Unknown Linear Diffusion Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear diffusion processes serve as canonical continuous-time models for dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. These systems evolve according to drift matrices that specify the instantaneous rates of change in the expected system state, while also experiencing continuous random disturbances modeled by Brownian noise. For instance, in medical applications such as artificial pancreas systems, the drift matrices represent the internal dynamics of glucose concentrations. Classical results in stochastic control provide optimal policies under perfect knowledge of the drift matrices. However, practical decision-making scenarios typically feature uncertainty about the drift; in medical contexts, such parameters are patient-specific and unknown, requiring adaptive policies for efficiently learning the drift matrices while ensuring system stability and optimal performance.
  We study the Thompson sampling (TS) algorithm for decision-making in linear diffusion processes with unknown drift matrices. For this algorithm that designs control policies as if samples from a posterior belief about the parameters fully coincide with the unknown truth, we establish efficiency. That is, Thompson sampling learns optimal control actions fast, incurring only a square-root of time regret, and also learns to stabilize the system in a short time period. To our knowledge, this is the first such result for TS in a diffusion process control problem. Moreover, our empirical simulations in three settings that involve blood-glucose and flight control demonstrate that TS significantly improves regret, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, suggesting it explores in a more guarded fashion. Our theoretical analysis includes characterization of a certain optimality manifold that relates the geometry of the drift matrices to the optimal control of the diffusion process, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite connected graph $G$ and a non-empty subset $S$ of its vertices thought of sinks, the so-called critical group (or sandpile group) $C(G, S)$ has been studied for a long time. We present a class of graphs where such an extension can be made in a unified way. Similar extension was made by Maes, C. and Redig, F. and Saada, E., but we propose a more algebraic point of view.
  Namely, consider a $C$-net $S\subset \mathbb Z^2$. We define a sandpile dynamics on $\mathbb Z^2$ with the set $S$ of sinks. For such a choice of sinks, a relaxation of any bounded state is well defined. This allows us to define a group $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ of recurrent states of this model. We show that $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ is isomorphic to a group of $S^1$-valued discrete harmonic functions on $\mathbb Z^2\setminus S$.
  Examples of $S$, for which $C(\mathbb Z^2, S)$ has no torsion or has all torsions, are provided. Pontryagin dual point of view is investigated. A discussion about perspectives of a sandpile group for $\mathbb Z^2$ as a projective limit concludes this work.</description>

      <title>A Novel Neural Filter to Improve Accuracy of Neural Network Models of Dynamic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of neural networks in modeling dynamic systems has become prominent due to their ability to estimate complex nonlinear functions. Despite their effectiveness, neural networks face challenges in long-term predictions, where the prediction error diverges over time, thus degrading their accuracy. This paper presents a neural filter to enhance the accuracy of long-term state predictions of neural network-based models of dynamic systems. Motivated by the extended Kalman filter, the neural filter combines the neural network state predictions with the measurements from the physical system to improve the estimated state's accuracy. The neural filter's improvements in prediction accuracy are demonstrated through applications to four nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments show that the neural filter significantly improves prediction accuracy and bounds the state estimate covariance, outperforming the neural network predictions. Furthermore, it is also shown that the accuracy of a poorly trained neural network model can be improved to the same level as that of an adequately trained neural network model, potentially decreasing the training cost and required data to train a neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a density-based framework for safe navigation in dynamic environments characterized by time-varying obstacle sets and time-varying target regions. We propose an analytical construction of time-varying density functions that enables the synthesis of a feedback controller defined as the positive gradient of the resulting density field. The primary contribution of this paper is a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating almost-everywhere safe navigation under the proposed framework, specifically for systems governed by single-integrator dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first analytical guarantees of their kind for navigation in dynamic environments using density functions. We illustrate the applicability of the framework to systems with more complex dynamics, including multi-agent systems and robotic manipulators, using standard control design techniques such as backstepping and inverse dynamics. These results provide a foundation for extending density-based navigation methods to a broad class of robotic systems operating in time-varying environments.</description>

Abstract: We associate parametric classes of $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems which admit $k$ additional linear Darboux polynomials, with admissible loopless hypergraphs of order $n$ and size $k$. We study the equivalence relation on admissible hypergraphs induced by linear transformations of the associated LV-systems, for $n\leq 5$. We present a new 13-parameter 5-component superintegrable Lotka-Volterra system, i.e. one that is not equivalent to a so-called tree-system. We conjecture that tree-systems associated with nonisomorphic trees are not equivalent, which we verified for $n&lt;9$.</description>

      <title>Notions of entropy for unitary representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several notions of entropy are studied widely in the ergodic theory of probability-preserving actions of countable groups. These include the generalization of Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy for amenable groups using F\o lner sequences, percolative entropy entropy for general countable groups, and Bowen's sofic entropy for sofic groups.
  In this work we pursue these notions across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. Our main results show that these new quantities can generally be evaluated as Fuglede--Kadison determinants. The resulting formulas for those determinants can be seen as various non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants. They also establish connections with Arveson's theory of subdiagonal subalgebras, and with some more recent exact entropy calculations in the ergodic theory of actions by automorphisms of compact Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Turbulence modeling over riblets via domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for triangular and scalloped riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of K-H rollers over large and sharp scalloped riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of passive tracer transport in turbulent flows with a mean gradient, emphasizing tracer intermittency and extreme events. An analytically tractable model is developed, coupling zonal and shear velocity components with both linear and nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Formulating the model in Fourier space, a simple explicit solution for the tracer invariant statistics is derived. Through this model we identify the resonance condition responsible for non-Gaussian behavior and bursts in the tracer. Resonant conditions, that lead to a peak in the tracer variance, occur when the zonal flow and the shear flow phase speeds are equivalent. Numerical experiments across a range of regimes, including different energy spectra and zonal flow models, are performed to validate these findings and demonstrate how the velocity field and stochasticity determines tracer extremes. These results provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying turbulent tracer transport, with implications for uncertainty quantification and data assimilation in geophysical and environmental applications.</description>
