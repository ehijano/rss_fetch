      <title>Negative redispatch power for green hydrogen production: Game changer or lame duck? A German perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following years of controversial discussions about the risks of market-based redispatch, the German transmission network operators finally installed regional redispatch markets by the end of 2024. Since water electrolysers are eligible market participants, the otherwise downwards redispatched renewable energy can be used for green hydrogen production in compliance with European law. To show how different price levels in regional redispatch markets affect green hydrogen production cost and thus the incentive for electrolyser market participation, we use historic redispatch time series and evaluate various power purchase scenarios. Our results show that low price levels can lead to notable production cost reductions, potentially counteracting uncertainties in redispatch power availability and thus incentivising system-beneficial electrolyser siting. In contrast, the possibility of high price levels can nullify an increase in the competitiveness of German and European green hydrogen through production cost reductions and discourage market participation.</description>

      <title>The Interaction Between Domestic Monetary Policy and Macroprudential Policy in Israel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global financial crisis (GFC) triggered the use of macroprudential policies imposed on the banking sector. Using bank-level panel data for Israel for the period 2004-2019, we find that domestic macroprudential measures changed the composition of bank credit growth but did not affect the total credit growth rate. Specifically, we show that macroprudential measures targeted at the housing sector moderated housing credit growth but tended to increase business credit growth. We also find that accommodative monetary policy surprises tended to increase bank credit growth before the GFC. We show that accommodative monetary policy surprises increased consumer credit when interacting with macroprudential policies targeting the housing market. Accommodative monetary policy interacted with nonhousing macroprudential measures to increase total credit.</description>

      <title>Unwitting Markowitz' Simplification of Portfolio Random Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his famous paper, Markowitz (1952) derived the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of its securities. This result allowed Markowitz to obtain his famous expression for portfolio variance. We show that Markowitz's equation for portfolio random returns and the expression for portfolio variance, which results from it, describe a simplified approximation of the real markets when the volumes of all consecutive trades with the securities are assumed to be constant during the averaging interval. To show this, we consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of securities of his portfolio. The investor only observes the trades made in the market with his securities and derives the time series that model the trades with his portfolio as with a single security. These time series describe the portfolio return and variance in exactly the same way as the time series of trades with securities describe their returns and variances. The portfolio time series reveal the dependence of portfolio random returns on the random returns of securities and on the ratio of the random volumes of trades with the securities to the random volumes of trades with the portfolio. If we assume that all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are constant, obtain Markowitz's equation for the portfolio's random returns. The market-based variance of the portfolio accounts for the effects of random fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. The use of Markowitz variance may give significantly higher or lower estimates than market-based portfolio variance.</description>
