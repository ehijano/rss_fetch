      <title>Quantization of the electromagnetic field, entropy of an ideal monoatomic gas, and the birth of Bose-Einstein statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1924, Einstein received a short manuscript in the mail from the Indian physicist S.N. Bose. He quickly translated Bose's manuscript to German and submitted it to Zeitschrift f\"ur Physik. Within a few weeks, Einstein presented his own findings (using a generalization of Bose's counting method) to a session of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Whereas Bose had suggested a new counting method for the quanta of the electromagnetic field -- one that yielded Planck's blackbody radiation formula -- Einstein applied Bose's method to an ideal monoatomic gas. Shortly afterward, Einstein presented to the Academy a follow-up paper in which he described the Bose-Einstein condensation for the first time. The present paper describes some of the fascinating issues that Einstein struggled with as he attempted to unify the quantum-statistical properties of matter with those of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Limiting velocity and generalized Lorentz trasformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a short Historical bibliographical note, in the Starting points attention will be focused on some postulates common to classical mechanics and special relativity. Starting from these premises, in the sections The deduction of the form of possible transformations and The Ignatowsky constant it will be shown that the choice between the Galilean scheme and one of the generalized Lorentz type is in fact the only possible one. In a generalized Lorentz scheme, the interactions propagate at a finite velocity VL and the form of the transformations of the space-time coordinates of the events is analogous to those of Lorentz; the only difference is that the limiting speed VL plays the role assumed by the invariance of c, the speed of light in a vacuum, in Lorentz transformations. The line of development of the arguments does not depend directly on electromagnetism, in other words we are dealing with a regulating principle for kinematics and for the set of laws of physics. The assumption VL=c can be assumed from the experimental datum of the invariance of c, i.e. from the validity of Maxwell's equations. Galileo transformations are obtained if and only if the time interval between two events is an invariant for inertial frames of reference, if this interval is not invariant then the transformations are of the generalized Lorentz type. In this framework, the experimental confirmations of the non-invariance of time intervals constitute an indirect confirmation of the generalized Lorentz transformations and therefore of the existence of a limiting velocity for the interactions. During the course of the discussion, a demonstration of the "Reciprocity Lemma" will also be presented, different and simpler than other approaches proposed in the literature [6,7,8].</description>

      <title>On a Seldom Oversight in Fermi's Calculations: Seventy Years Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16676v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an unfortunate mistake, for a Dirac free particle, in the last Fermi lecture notes on quantum mechanics, in a course given at the University of Chicago in winter and spring of 1954. As is demonstrated, the correct result can be obtained by a simple matrix multiplication. An attempt to collect a relevant bibliography is made.</description>
