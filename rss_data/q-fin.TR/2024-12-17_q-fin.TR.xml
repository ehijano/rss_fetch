      <title>Auto-Regressive Control of Execution Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bertsimas and Lo's seminal work established a foundational framework for addressing the implementation shortfall dilemma faced by large institutional investors. Their models emphasized the critical role of accurate knowledge of market microstructure and price/information dynamics in optimizing trades to minimize execution costs. However, this paper recognizes that perfect initial knowledge may not be a realistic assumption for new investors entering the market. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap by proposing an approach that iteratively derives OLS estimates of the market parameters from period to period. This methodology enables uninformed investors to engage in the market dynamically, adjusting their strategies over time based on evolving estimates, thus offering a practical solution for navigating the complexities of execution cost optimization without perfect initial knowledge.</description>

      <title>FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of news on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities. However, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its dissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements. Additionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and explicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret news. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances LLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news dissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster recent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching prompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to construct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting short-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 8\% compared to existing methods.</description>
