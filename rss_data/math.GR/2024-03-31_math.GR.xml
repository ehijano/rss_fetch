      <title>Tannaka-Krein duality for Roelcke-precompact non-archimedean Polish groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a Roelcke-precompact non-archimedean Polish group, B(G) the algebra of matrix coefficients of G arising from its continuous unitary representations. The Gel'fand spectrum H(G) of the norm closure of B(G) is known as the Hilbert compactification of G. Let A be the dense subalgebra of B(G) generated by indicator maps of open cosets in G. We prove that multiplicative linear functionals on A are automatically continuous, generalizing a result of Krein for finite dimensional representations of topological groups. We deduce two abstract realizations of H(G). One is the space P(MG) of partial isomorphisms with algebraically closed domain of MG, the countable set of open cosets of G seen as a homogeneous first order logical structure. The other is T(G) the Tannaka monoid of G. We also obtain that the natural functor that sends G to the category of its representations is full and faithful.</description>

      <title>Every locally compact group is the outer automorphism group of a II$_1$ factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every locally compact second countable group $G$ arises as the outer automorphism group Out $M$ of a II$_1$ factor, which was so far only known for totally disconnected groups, compact groups and a few isolated examples. We obtain this result by proving that every locally compact second countable group is a centralizer group, a class of Polish groups that may all be realized as Out $M$ and for which we prove several basic properties and characterizations.</description>

      <title>Optimal s-boxes against alternative operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Civino et al. have characterised diffusion layers that expose an SPN to vulnerability from differential cryptanalysis when employing alternative operations coming from groups isomorphic to the translation group on the message space. In this study, we present a classification of diffusion layers that exhibit linearity in parallel alternative operations for ciphers with 4-bit s-boxes, enabling the possibility of an alternative differential attack simultaneously targeting all the s-boxes within the block. Furthermore, we investigate the differential behaviour with respect to alternative operations for all classes of optimal 4-bit s-boxes, as defined by Leander and Poschmann (2007). Our examination reveals that certain classes contain weak permutations w.r.t. alternative differential attacks, and we leverage these vulnerabilities to execute a series of experiments.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal calculations in fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Hopf invariants, defined by evaluation in Harrison cohomology of the commutative cochains of a space, calculate the logarithm map from a fundamental group to its Malcev Lie algebra. They thus present the zeroth Harrison cohomology as a universal dual object to the Malcev Lie algebra. This structural theorem supports explicit calculations in algebraic topology, geometric topology and combinatorial group theory. In particular, we give the first algorithm to determine whether a word raised to some power is a k-fold nested product of commutators, in any group presented by generators and relations.</description>

      <title>Mekler's Construction and Murphy's Law for 2-Nilpotent Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mekler's construction is a powerful technique for building purely algebraic structures from combinatorial ones. Its power lies in the fact that it allows various model-theoretic tameness properties of the combinatorial structure to transfer to the algebraic one. In this paper, we push this ideology much further, describing a broad class of properties that transfer through Mekler's construction. This technique subsumes many well-known results and opens avenues for many more.
  As a straightforward application of our methods, we (1) obtain transfer principles for stably embedded pairs of Mekler groups and (2) construct the first examples of strictly $\mathsf{NFOP}_k$ pure groups for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;2}$. We also answer a question of Chernikov and Hempel on the transfer of burden.</description>

      <title>Graphs and groups with unique geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A connected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if there is a unique geodesic between each pair of vertices. In this paper we prove that if a finitely generated group admits a Cayley graph which is geodetic, then the group must be virtually free. Before now, it was open whether finitely generated and geodetic implied hyperbolic. In fact we prove something more general: if a quasi-transitive locally finite connected undirected graph is geodetic then it is quasi-isometric to a tree. Our main tool is to define a \emph{boundary} of a graph and understand how the local behaviour influences it when the graph is geodetic. Our results unify, and represent significant progress on, research initiated by Ore, Shapiro, and Madlener and Otto.</description>

      <title>Strong Nielsen equivalence on the punctured disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the 2-disc $\mathbb{D}^2$ that fixes the boundary pointwise and leaves invariant a finite subset in the interior of $\mathbb{D}^2$. We study the strong Nielsen equivalence of periodic points of such homeomorphisms $f$ and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for two periodic points to be strong Nielsen equivalent in the context of braid theory. In addition, we present an application of our result to the trace formula given by Jiang--Zheng, deducing that the obtained forced periodic orbits belong to different strong Nielsen classes.</description>
