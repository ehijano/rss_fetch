      <title>Constructing Linear Operators Using Classical Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for generating linear operators that approximately represent nonlinear systems of perturbed ordinary differential equations. This is done through the application of classical perturbation theory via the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e expansion, followed by an extension of the space of configuration that guarantees the linear representation of the expanded system of differential equations. To ensure that such a linear representation exists, this paper uses polynomial basis functions. Pseudo-code describing the implementation of the proposed method is listed. The method is applied to the Duffing oscillator as well as to the J2 problem, with and without atmospheric drag, both analyzed using an osculating formulation. Additionally, conditions on the osculating Keplerian elements that produce low-eccentricity frozen orbits are presented, and a modification of the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method is proposed to enable the generation of linear operators that dynamically adapt to changes in the frequency of the motion. Finally, the proposed method is compared with alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the predictability of dynamical systems: a new local data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive a faithful representation. Here, we propose a new data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. Applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets, this new index shows results consistent with existing knowledge, proving its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with local dynamical indices, illustrating how it complements the previous framework as a more direct measure of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its reflection of the scale-dependent nature of predictability, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in the Square Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate and analyze anomalous diffusion properties of point-like particles in a two-dimensional system with circular scatterers arranged in a square lattice and governed by smooth potentials, referred to as the square soft Lorentz gas. Our numerical simulations reveal a rich interplay of normal and anomalous diffusion depending on the system parameters. To describe diffusion in normal regimes, we develop a unit cell hopping model that, in the single-hop limit, recovers the Machta-Zwanzig approximation and converges toward the numerical diffusion coefficient as the number of hops increases. Anomalous diffusion is characterized by quasiballistic orbits forming Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands in phase space, alongside a complex tongue structure in parameter space defined by the interscatterer distance and potential softness. The distributions of the particle displacement vector show notable similarities to both analytical and numerical results for a hard-wall square Lorentz gas, exhibiting Gaussian behavior in normal diffusion and long tails due to quasiballistic orbits in anomalous regimes. Our work thus provides a catalog of key dynamical system properties that characterize the intricate changes in diffusion when transitioning from hard billiards to soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Exact mean and variance of the squared Hellinger distance for random density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hellinger distance between quantum states is a significant measure in quantum information theory, known for its Riemannian and monotonic properties. It is also easier to compute than the Bures distance, another measure that shares these properties. In this work, we derive the mean and variance of the Hellinger distance between pairs of density matrices, where one or both matrices are random. Along the way, we also obtain exact results for the mean affinity and mean square affinity. The first two cumulants of the Hellinger distance allow us to propose an approximation for the corresponding probability density function based on the gamma distribution. Our analytical results are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operators for spatiotemporal dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics of pulsating spheres orbiting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the chaotic dynamics of spinless extended bodies in a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, which encompasses black-hole scenarios in many modified theories of gravity. We show that a spherically symmetric pulsating ball may have chaotic motion in this class of spacetimes. The cases of the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m and Ay{\'o}n-Beato-Garc{\'i}a black holes are analyzed in detail. The equations of motion for the extended bodies are obtained according to Dixon's formalism, up to quadrupole order. Then, we use Melnikov's method to show the presence of homoclinic intersections, which imply chaotic behavior, as a consequence of our assumption that the test body has an oscillating radius.</description>

      <title>Data-driven model discovery with Kolmogorov-Arnold networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven model discovery of complex dynamical systems is typically done using sparse optimization, but it has a fundamental limitation: sparsity in that the underlying governing equations of the system contain only a small number of elementary mathematical terms. Examples where sparse optimization fails abound, such as the classic Ikeda or optical-cavity map in nonlinear dynamics and a large variety of ecosystems. Exploiting the recently articulated Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, we develop a general model-discovery framework for any dynamical systems including those that do not satisfy the sparsity condition. In particular, we demonstrate non-uniqueness in that a large number of approximate models of the system can be found which generate the same invariant set with the correct statistics such as the Lyapunov exponents and Kullback-Leibler divergence. An analogy to shadowing of numerical trajectories in chaotic systems is pointed out.</description>

      <title>The Graph Structure of Chebyshev Permutation Polynomials over Ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the underlying graph structure of a nonlinear map over a particular domain is essential in evaluating its potential for real applications. In this paper, we investigate the structure of the associated \textit{functional graph} of Chebyshev permutation polynomials over a ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$, with $p$ being a prime number greater than three, where every number in the ring is considered as a vertex and the existing mapping relation between two vertices is regarded as a directed edge. Based on some new properties of Chebyshev polynomials and their derivatives, we disclose how the basic structure of the functional graph evolves with respect to parameter $k$. First, we present a complete and explicit form of the length of a path starting from any given vertex. Then, we show that the strong patterns of the functional graph that the number of cycles of any given length always remains constant as $k$ increases. Moreover, we rigorously prove the rules on the elegant structure of the functional graph and verify them experimentally. Our results could be useful for studying the emergence of the complexity of a nonlinear map in digital computers and security analysis of its cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting multi-parametric dynamics of externally forced oscillator using reservoir computing and minimal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical systems exhibit complex dynamical behavior from harmonic oscillations to chaotic motion. The dynamics undergo qualitative changes due to changes to internal system parameters like stiffness and changes to external forcing. Mapping out complete bifurcation diagrams numerically or experimentally is resource-consuming, or even infeasible. This study uses a data-driven approach to investigate how bifurcations can be learned from a few system response measurements. Particularly, the concept of reservoir computing (RC) is employed. As proof of concept, a minimal training dataset under the resource constraint problem of a Duffing oscillator with harmonic external forcing is provided as training data. Our results indicate that the RC not only learns to represent the system dynamics for the external forcing seen during training, but it also provides qualitatively accurate and robust system response predictions for completely unknown multi-parameter regimes outside the training data. Particularly, while being trained solely on regular period-2 cycle dynamics, the proposed framework correctly predicts higher-order periodic and even chaotic dynamics for out-of-distribution forcing signals.</description>

      <title>Chaotic uncertainty and statistical inference for natural chaotic systems: Choosing predictors for multiple season ahead prediction of precipitation, Extended and Annotated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we define natural chaotic systems, like the earths weather and climate system, as chaotic systems which are open to the world so have constantly changing boundary conditions, and measurements of their states are subject to errors. In such systems the chaoticity, amplifying error exponentially fast, is so confounded with the boundary condition fluctuations and the measurement error, that it is impossible to consistently estimate the trajectory of the system much less predict it. Although asymptotic theory exists for estimating the conditional predictive distributions, it is hard to find where this theory has been applied. Here the theory is reviewed, and applied to identifying useful predictive variables for simultaneous multiseason prediction of precipitation with potentially useful updating possible. This is done at two locations, one midocean the other landlocked. The method appears to show promise for fast exploration of variables for multiseason prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TURB-Lagr, a new open database of 3d turbulent Lagrangian trajectories, obtained by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the original Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of a homogeneous and isotropic forcing. The aim is to provide the community interested in data-assimilation and/or Lagrangian-properties of turbulence a new testing-ground made of roughly 300K different Lagrangian trajectories. TURB-Lagr data are influenced by the strong non-Gaussian fluctuations characteristic of turbulence and by the rough and non differentiable fields. In addition, coming from fully resolved numerical simulations of the original partial differential equations, they offer the possibility to apply a wide range of approaches, from equation-free to physics-based models. TURB-Lagr data are reachable at http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it</description>

      <title>Rapid Bayesian identification of sparse nonlinear dynamics from scarce and noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fast probabilistic framework for identifying differential equations governing the dynamics of observed data. We recast the SINDy method within a Bayesian framework and use Gaussian approximations for the prior and likelihood to speed up computation. The resulting method, Bayesian-SINDy, not only quantifies uncertainty in the parameters estimated but also is more robust when learning the correct model from limited and noisy data. Using both synthetic and real-life examples such as Lynx-Hare population dynamics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new framework in learning correct model equations and compare its computational and data efficiency with existing methods. Because Bayesian-SINDy can quickly assimilate data and is robust against noise, it is particularly suitable for biological data and real-time system identification in control. Its probabilistic framework also enables the calculation of information entropy, laying the foundation for an active learning strategy.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency of Synchronization Dynamics and the Role of Network Syncreactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fundamental process in both natural and artificial networks. While much work has investigated the asymptotic stability of the synchronous solution, the fundamental question of the transient behavior toward synchronization has received far less attention. In this work, we present the transverse reactivity as a metric to quantify the instantaneous rate of growth or decay of desynchronizing perturbations. We first use the transverse reactivity to design a coupling-efficient and energy-efficient synchronization strategy that involves varying the coupling strength dynamically according to the current state of the system. We find that our synchronization strategy is able to synchronize networks in both simulation and experiment over a significantly larger (often by orders of magnitude) range of coupling strengths than is possible when the coupling strength is constant. Then, we characterize the effects of network topology on the transient dynamics towards synchronization by introducing the concept of network syncreactivity: A network with a larger syncreactivity has a larger transverse reactivity at every point on the synchronization manifold, independent of the oscillator dynamics. We classify real-world examples of complex networks in terms of their syncreactivity.</description>
