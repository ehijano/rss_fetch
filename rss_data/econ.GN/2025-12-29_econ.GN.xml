      <title>Why Bahar and Hausmann Tell Us Nothing About Venezuelan Migration Flows to the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bahar and Hausmann (2025a) claim to find evidence against the hypothesis that oil sanctions on Venezuela lead to increased migration flows to the United States. We show that their findings derive from applying a nonstandard, misspecified Engle-Granger test to first differences. This specification is incorrect because cointegration tests are designed to evaluate relationships between the levels of variables, not their first differences. Since the residuals from regressions of I(0) variables will, under general conditions, be stationary, testing for cointegration between first differences of I(1) variables virtually ensures a spurious finding of cointegration. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the misspecified Bahar-Hausmann test on first differences exhibits a false positive rate of 100 percent. Once the Engle-Granger test is applied correctly to the logarithms of levels, the evidence of cointegration vanishes. The Bahar-Hausmann regressions therefore provide no valid basis for inference about any underlying relationship between migration and Venezuelan oil revenues.</description>

      <title>Team for Speed: Nonparametric Evidence on Heterogeneous Skill-Specific Affinity in Team Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether team affinity differs across skill dimensions in team production. Using a novel nonparametric framework that accommodates task-level structure, role asymmetry, and latent affinity, we decompose team performance into skill-specific productivity and unobserved match affinity. As an illustrative application, we analyze elite women's bobsleigh data, where performance can be separated into start and riding phases with distinct individual skill inputs. The estimates reveal heterogeneous, task-specific affinities: coordination and complementarity are stronger in the start phase but weaker and more dispersed during riding, underscoring skill-specific heterogeneity in unobserved team affinity.</description>

      <title>The Peter Principle Revisited: An Agent-Based Model of Promotions, Efficiency, and Mitigation Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Peter Principle posits that organizations promoting their best performers risk elevating employees to roles where their competence no longer translates, thereby degrading overall efficiency. We investigate when this dynamic emerges and how to mitigate it using a large-scale agent-based model (ABM) of a five-level hierarchy. Results show the Peter Principle is most pronounced under merit promotion when role requirements change substantially between levels; seniority and random exhibit the weakest Peter effects. Both interventions mitigate performance declines, with merit-with-training particularly effective when skill transfer is limited, and selective demotion restoring agents whose 'true' peak performance is at lower levels.</description>

      <title>Structure, Risk, and Access to Credit: Reassessment of the Paycheck Protection Program Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was the largest targeted business support program in the United States, yet its firm-level effects remain contested. I link administrative PPP and SBA 7(a) records to a near-universe panel of U.S. employer firms from Dun and Bradstreet, covering roughly 30 million establishments, and evaluate short-run impacts on employment, financial stress, and commercial credit risk. To address non-random take-up, I combine propensity score matching with difference-in-differences on a balanced panel from March to September 2020 and exploit variation in loan holding duration. PPP receipt raises employment by about 0.07 percent on average but improves failure-risk and delinquency-risk percentile rankings by roughly 1.2 and 3.2 points, respectively, with longer loan duration strengthening all three margins. Heterogeneity analysis shows that small-to-medium firms and borrowers with intermediate pre-crisis risk experience the largest gains, while micro firms, very large firms, and highly stressed firms benefit less. Firms without prior 7(a) borrowing relationships realize particularly large credit-score gains. Overall, the evidence indicates that PPP functioned more as a balance-sheet and credit-risk backstop than as a powerful jobs program for the average treated firm. The results highlight how firm structure, pre-crisis financial health, and access to government-backed credit shape the effectiveness of large-scale emergency support.</description>

      <title>Legacy Lending Relationships and Credit Rationing: Evidence from the Paycheck Protection Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines how legacy lending relationships shape the allocation of emergency credit under severe information frictions. Using a novel dataset linking Small Business Administration (SBA) loan records with Dun and Bradstreet microdata for over 26 million U.S. firms, I investigate whether prior participation in the SBA 7(a) program acted as a gateway to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Employing entropy balancing to construct a strictly comparable counterfactual group, I document a distinct dynamic evolution in credit rationing. In the program's initial "panic phase" in April 2020, banks relied heavily on legacy ties as a screening technology: firms with prior 7(a) relationships were approximately 29 percentage points more likely to receive funding than observationally identical non-7(a) firms. By June 2021, however, this insider advantage had largely vanished, suggesting that policy adjustments and extended timelines eventually mitigated the initial intermediation frictions. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between speed and equity in crisis response. While leveraging existing credit rails accelerates deployment, it systematically excludes informationally opaque borrowers. I discuss policy implications for designing future digital infrastructure to decouple verification from historical lending relationships.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Dodd-Frank and the Huawei Shock on DRC Tin Exports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structural transformation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) tin market induced by the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act. Focusing on the breakdown of the pricing mechanism, we estimate the price elasticity of export demand from 2010 to 2022 using a structural identification strategy that overcomes the lack of reliable unit value data. Our analysis reveals that the regulation effectively destroyed the price mechanism, with demand elasticity dropping to zero. This indicates the formation of a ``captive market'' driven by certification requirements rather than price competitiveness. Crucially, we find strong hysteresis; deregulation alone failed to restore market flexibility. The structural rigidity was finally broken not by policy suspension, but by the 2019 ``Huawei shock,'' an external demand surge that forced supply chain diversification. These findings suggest that conflict mineral regulations can induce monopolistic bottlenecks that are resilient to simple deregulation.</description>

      <title>When Indemnity Insurance Fails: Parametric Coverage under Binding Budget and Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-risk environments, traditional indemnity insurance is often unaffordable or ineffective, despite its well-known optimality under expected utility. This paper compares excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees with a Network of Relative Performance Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial firms and institutional investors are routinely evaluated based on their performance relative to their peers. These relative performance concerns significantly influence risk-taking behavior and market dynamics. While the literature studying Nash equilibrium under such relative performance competitions is extensive, its effect on asset price formation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates mean-field equilibrium price formation of a single risky stock in a discrete-time market where agents exhibit exponential utility and relative performance concerns. Unlike existing literature that typically treats asset prices as exogenous, we impose a market-clearing condition to determine the price dynamics endogenously within a relative performance equilibrium. Using a binomial tree framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the market-clearing mean-field equilibrium in both single- and multi-population settings. Finally, we provide illustrative numerical examples demonstrating the equilibrium price distributions and agents' optimal position sizes.</description>

      <title>Metawisdom of the Crowd: Experimental Evidence of Crowd Accuracy Through Diverse Choices of Decision Aids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The provision of information can improve individual judgments but also fail to make group decisions more accurate; if individuals choose to attend to the same information in the same manner, the predictive diversity that enables crowd wisdom may be lost. Decision support systems, from search engines to business intelligence platforms, present individuals with decision aids -- relevant information, interpretative frames, or heuristics -- to enhance the quality and speed of decision-making but potentially influence judgments through the selective presentation of information and interpretative frames. We describe decision-making as often containing two decisions: the choice of decision aids followed by the primary decision, and define \textit{metawisdom of the crowd} as any pattern by which individuals' choice of aids leads to higher crowd accuracy than equal assignment to the same aids, a comparison that accounts for the information content of the aids. The theoretical model accounting for aid bias and variance shows that an optimal distribution of aid usage can produce metawisdom based on the characteristics of aids within a collection. Three studies -- two estimation tasks (N=900, 728) and the nowcasting of inflation (N=1,956; across three collections) -- support this claim. Metawisdom emerges from the use of diverse aids, not through widespread use of the aids that induce the most accurate estimates. Thus, the microfoundations of crowd wisdom appear in the first choice, suggesting crowd wisdom can be robust in information choice problems. Given the implications for collective decision-making, the insights warrant future research investigations into the nature and use of decision aids.</description>

      <title>Solving stochastic climate-economy models: A deep least-squares Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic versions of recursive integrated climate-economy assessment models are essential for studying and quantifying policy decisions under uncertainty. However, as the number of state variables and stochastic shocks increases, solving these models via deterministic grid-based dynamic programming (e.g., value-function iteration / projection on a discretized grid over continuous state variables, typically coupled with discretized shocks) becomes computationally infeasible, and simulation-based methods are needed. The least-squares Monte Carlo (LSMC) method has become popular for solving optimal stochastic control problems in quantitative finance. In this paper, we extend the application of the LSMC method to stochastic climate-economy models. We exemplify this approach using a stochastic version of the DICE model with five key uncertainty sources highlighted in the literature. To address the complexity and high dimensionality of these models, we incorporate deep neural network approximations in place of standard regression techniques within the LSMC framework. Our results demonstrate that the deep LSMC method can be used to efficiently derive optimal policies for climate-economy models in the presence of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Innovative activities of Activision Blizzard: A patent network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard valued at $68.7 billion has drastically altered the landscape of the video game industry. At the time of the takeover, the intellectual properties of Activision Blizzard included World of Warcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, StarCraft, Overwatch, Battlenet, Candy Crush Saga, and Call of Duty. This article aims to explore the patenting activity of Activision Blizzard between 2008 (the original merger) and 2023 (the Microsoft acquisition). Four IPC code co-occurrence networks (co-classification maps) are constructed and analyzed based on the patent data downloaded from the WIPO Patentscope database. International Patent Classification (IPC) codes are a language agnostic system for the classification of patents. When multiple IPC codes co-occur in a patent, it shows that the technologies are connected. These relationships can be used for patent mapping. The analysis identifies the prolific and bridging technologies of Activision Blizzard and explores its synergistic role as a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation.</description>

      <title>Bribery, Secrecy, and Communication: Theory and Evidence from Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies if firms pay different types of bribes, and if corrupt bureaucrats have perfect information about resources of bribe-paying firms. We construct a model of corruption that allows for multiple informational scenarios in a single market for bribes and empirically test these scenarios on the original dataset of 429 firms operating in Tajikistan. The results indicate that firms simultaneously make voluntary and involuntary bribe payments, firms hide resources from corrupt bureaucrats to reduce involuntary bribe payments, and bureaucrats who receive voluntary bribe payments do not share bribery-relevant information with other bureaucrats.</description>
