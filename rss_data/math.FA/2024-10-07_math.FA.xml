      <title>On spectral representation and sampling for unbounded continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies spectral representation as well as sampling and interpolation problems for non-vanishing continuous time signals. The notions of transfer functions, the spectrum gaps, and bandlimitness are introduced for these signals. As an application, an analog Sampling Theorem and a modification of Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula for unbounded signals is obtained.</description>

      <title>Joint $q$-Numerical Ranges of Operators in Hilbert and Semi-Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates the concept of the $q$-numerical range for tuples of bounded linear operators in Hilbert spaces. We establish various inequalities concerning the $q$-numerical radius associated with these operator tuples. Furthermore, we extend our study to define the $q$-numerical range in semi-Hilbert spaces and provide a proof of its convexity. Additionally, we explore several related results in this context.</description>

      <title>Interpolation spaces of Besov hierarchical spaces and non-linearities defined by vertex K functional and grid topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1967, Peetre proposed to give a precise description of the real interpolation space for Besov hierarchical spaces $l^{s,q}(A)$. In 1974, Cwikel proved that the Lions-Peetre formula for $(l^{q_0}(A_0), l^{q_1}(A_1))_{\theta,r}$ have no reasonable generalization for any $r\neq q$. In this paper, we apply wavelets to transform the study of real interpolation space into {\bf the study of nonlinear functional structure and nonlinear topological structure}. We solve completely Peetre's longstanding open problem.</description>

      <title>Peetre conjecture on real interpolation spaces of Besov spaces and Grid K functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Peetre's conjecture about the real interpolation space of Besov space {\bf is solved completely } by using the classification of vertices of cuboids defined by {\bf wavelet coefficients and wavelet's grid structure}. Littlewood-Paley analysis provides only a decomposition of the function on the ring. We extend Lorentz's rearrangement function and Hunt's Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem to more general cases. We use the method of calculating the topological quantity of the grid to replace the traditional methods of data classification such as gradient descent method and distributed algorithm.
  We developed a series of new techniques to solve this longstanding open problem. These skills make up for the deficiency of Lions-Peetre iterative theorem in dealing with strong nonlinearity. Using the properties of wavelet basis, a series of {\bf functional nonlinearities} are studied. Using the lattice property of wavelet, we study the lattice topology. By three kinds of {\bf topology nonlinearities}, we give the specific wavelet expression of K functional.</description>

      <title>A several variables Kowalski-S\lodkowski theorem for topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a version of the classical result of Kowalski and S\l odkowski that generalizes the famous Gleason-Kahane-$\dot{\rm Z}$elazko (GKZ) theorem by characterizing multiplicative linear functionals amongst all complex-valued functions on a Banach algebra. We first characterize maps on $\mathcal{A}$-valued polynomials of several variables that satisfy some conditions, motivated by the result of Kowalski and S\l odkowski, as a composition of a multiplicative linear functional on $\mathcal{A}$ and a point evaluation on the polynomials, where $\mathcal{A}$ is a complex Banach algebra with identity. We then apply it to prove an analogue of Kowalski and S\l odkowski's result on topological spaces of vector-valued functions of several variables. These results extend our previous work from \cite{jaikishan2024multiplicativity}; however, the techniques used differ from those used in \cite{jaikishan2024multiplicativity}. Furthermore, we characterize weighted composition operators between Hardy spaces over the polydisc amongst the continuous functions between them. Additionally, we register a partial but noteworthy success toward a multiplicative GKZ theorem for Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>On various diametral notions of points in the unit ball of some vector-valued function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the ccs-Daugavet, ccs-$\Delta$, super-Daugavet, super-$\Delta$, Daugavet, $\Delta$, and $\nabla$ points in the unit balls of vector-valued function spaces $C_0(L, X)$, $A(K, X)$, $L_\infty(\mu, X)$, and $L_1(\mu, X)$. To partially or fully characterize these diametral points, we first provide improvements of several stability results under $\oplus_\infty$ and $\oplus_1$-sums shown in the literature. For complex Banach spaces, $\nabla$ points are identical to Daugavet points, and so the study of $\nabla$ points only makes sense when a Banach space is real. Consequently, we obtain that the seven notions of diametral points are equivalent for $L_\infty(\mu)$ and uniform algebra when $K$ is infinite.</description>

      <title>Strong Law of Large Numbers for Random Sets in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) for random variables or random vectors with different mathematical expectations easily reduces by means of shifts to SLLN for random variables or random vectors whose mathematical expectations are equal to zero. The situation changes for random sets, where shifts cannot reduce sets of more than one point to the set $\{0\}$. We study effects that appear because of this difference.</description>

      <title>The $p$-Operator Approximation Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a notion analogous to the $p$-Approximation Property ($p$-AP) for Banach spaces, within the noncommutative context of operator spaces. Referred to as the $p$-Operator Approximation Property ($p$-OAP), this concept is linked to the ideal of operator $p$-compact mappings. We present several equivalent characterizations based on the density of finite-rank mappings within specific spaces for different topologies, and also one in terms of a slice mapping property. Additionally, we investigate how this property transfers from the dual or bidual to the original space. As an application, the $p$-OAP for the reduced $C^*$-algebra of a discrete group implies that operator $p$-compact Herz-Schur multipliers can be approximated in $\cb$-norm by finitely supported multipliers.</description>

      <title>Topological Foundations of Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to serve as a foundation for deep studies of the topology of state, action, and policy spaces in reinforcement learning. By studying these spaces from a mathematical perspective, we expect to gain more insight into how to build better algorithms to solve decision problems. Therefore, we focus on presenting the connection between the Banach fixed point theorem and the convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms, and we illustrate how the insights gained from this can practically help in designing more efficient algorithms. Before doing so, however, we first introduce relevant concepts such as metric spaces, normed spaces and Banach spaces for better understanding, before expressing the entire reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. This allows us to properly introduce the Banach contraction principle in a language suitable for reinforcement learning, and to write the Bellman equations in terms of operators on Banach spaces to show why reinforcement learning algorithms converge. Finally, we show how the insights gained from the mathematical study of convergence are helpful in reasoning about the best ways to make reinforcement learning algorithms more efficient.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in any normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'{e} constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'{e} constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call long range expansion, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends polynomially on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

Abstract: The article is about an elliptic problem defined on a {\it stratified Lie group}. Both sub- and superlinear cases are considered whose solutions are guaranteed to exist in light of the interplay between the nonlinearities and the weak $L^1$ datum. The existence of infinitely many solutions is proved for suitable values of $\lambda,p,q$ by using the Symmetric Mountain Pass Theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, motivated by the regularity theory of the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations the authors introduce the off-diagonal two-weight version of the parabolic Muckenhoupt class with time lag. Then the authors introduce the uncentered parabolic fractional maximal operator with time lag and characterize its two-weighted boundedness (including the endpoint case) via these weights under an extra mild assumption (which is not necessary for one-weight case). The most novelty of this article exists in that the authors further introduce a new parabolic shaped domain and its corresponding parabolic fractional integral with time lag and, moreover, applying the aforementioned two-weighted boundedness of the uncentered parabolic fractional maximal operator with time lag, the authors characterize the (two-)weighted boundedness (including the endpoint case) of these parabolic fractional integrals in terms of the off-diagonal (two-weight) parabolic Muckenhoupt class with time lag; as applications, the authors further establish a parabolic weighted Sobolev embedding and a priori estimate for the solution of the heat equation. The key tools to achieve these include the parabolic Calder\'on--Zygmund-type decomposition, the chaining argument, and the parabolic Welland inequality which is obtained by making the utmost of the geometrical relation between the parabolic shaped domain and the parabolic rectangle.</description>

      <title>Perturbed lattice crosses and Heisenberg uniqueness pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on two questions raised by H. Hedenmalm and A. Montes-Rodr\'iguez on Heisenberg Uniqueness Pairs for perturbed lattice crosses.
  The first of them deals with a complete characterization of $\beta&gt;0$ for which, for a fixed $\theta \in \mathbb{R},$ the translated lattice cross $\Lambda_{\beta}^{\theta} = ((\mathbb{Z} + \{\theta\}) \times \{0\}) \cup (\{0\} \times \beta \mathbb{Z})$ satisfies that $(\Gamma,\Lambda_{\beta}^{\theta})$ is a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair, where $\Gamma$ is the hyperbola in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with axes as asymptotes. We show that $(\Gamma,\Lambda_{\beta}^{\theta})$ is a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair if and only if $\beta \le 1$, confirming a prediction made by Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez.
  Furthermore, under modified decay conditions on the measures under consideration, we are able to prove sharp results for when a perturbed lattice cross $\Lambda_{\bf A,B}$ is such that $(\Gamma,\Lambda_{\bf A,B})$ is a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair. In particular, under such decay conditions, this solves another question posed by Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez.
  Our techniques run through the analysis of the action of the operator that maps the Fourier transform of an $L^1$ function $\psi$ to the Fourier transform of $t^{-2} \psi(1/t)$. In other words, we analyze the operator taking the restriction to the $x$-axis of a solution $u$ to the Klein-Gordon equation to its restriction to the $y$-axis. This operator turns out to be related to the action of the four-dimensional Fourier transform on radial functions, which enables us to use the framework and techniques of discrete uncertainty principles for the Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>A New Linear Programming Method in Sphere Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the linear programming method developed by Cohn and Elkies (Ann. Math. 157(2): 689-714, 2003), we introduce a new linear programming method to solve the sphere packing problem. More concretely, we consider sequences of auxiliary functions $\{g_m\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}^{+}}$, where $g_m$ is a $m\Lambda$-periodic auxiliary function defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $\Lambda$ being a given full-rank lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This new method extends the original approach and offers a greater flexibility. Furthermore, using this new linear programming framework, we construct several effective auxiliary functions for dimensions $n=1,2,3$. We hope this approach provides valuable insights into solving sphere packing problems for $n=2,3$ and even higher dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of (strong) subexponential growth for \'etale groupoids and study its basic properties. In particular, we show that the K-groups of the associated groupoid $L^p$-operator algebras are independent of $p \in [1,\infty)$ whenever the groupoid has strong subexponential growth. Several examples are discussed. Most significantly, we apply classical tools from analytic number theory to exhibit an example of an \'etale groupoid associated with a shift of infinite type which has strong subexponential growth, but not polynomial.</description>

      <title>Characterization of boundedness on Wiener amalgam spaces of multilinear Rihaczek distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give several characterizations for the boundedness of multilinear Rihaczek distributions acting from Wiener amalgam spaces to modulation and Fourier modulation spaces. Moreover, we establish the crucial self-improvement property which has its independent significance. As applications, sharp exponents are established for the boundedness in several typical cases. Correspondingly, the boundedness of pseudodifferential operators on Wiener amalgam spaces with symbols in modulation and Fourier modulation spaces are also established. In some typical cases, we also give the sharp exponents for the boundedness of pseudodifferential operators, including the recapture and essential extensions of the main results in \cite[IMRN, (10):1860-1893, (2010)]{CorderoNicola2010IMRNI} and \cite[JFAA, 23(4):810-816, (2017)]{Cunanan2017JoFAaA}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, new topological properties that an operator acting on a topological vector space can have were introduced: strong hypercyclicity and hypermixing. We introduce a new property called ultra hypercyclicity, and we compare it to the other common topological properties, including the new ones. For the family of weighted backward shifts on $c_0$ and $\ell^p$, we prove the existence of a strongly hypercyclic weighted backward shift which is not ultra hypercyclic.</description>

Abstract: We introduce two families of generators (functions) $\mathcal{G}$ that consist of entire and meromorphic functions enjoying a certain periodicity property and contain the classical Gaussian and hyperbolic secant generators. Sharp results are proved on the density of separated sets that provide non-uniform sampling for the shift-invariant and quasi shift-invariant spaces generated by elements of these families. As an application, we obtain new sharp results on the density of semi-regular lattices for the Gabor frames generated by elements from these families.</description>

      <title>Weighted Brunn-Minkowski Theory II: Inequalities for Mixed Measures and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In "Weighted Brunn-Minkowski Theory I", the prequel to this work, we discussed how recent developments on concavity of measures have laid the foundations of a nascent weighted Brunn-Minkowski theory. In particular, we defined the mixed measures of three convex bodies and obtained its integral representation. In this work, we obtain inequalities for mixed measures, such as a generalization of Fenchel's inequality; this provides a new, simpler proof of the classical volume case. Moreover, we show that mixed measures are connected to the study of log-submodularity and supermodularity of the measure of Minkowski sums of convex bodies. This elaborates on the recent investigations of these properties for the Lebesgue measure. We conclude by establishing that the only Radon measures that are supermodular over the class of compact, convex sets are multiples of the Lebesgue measure. Motivated by this result, we then discuss weaker forms of supermodularity by restricting the class of convex sets.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of intertwining operators over generalized convolution algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\sf G}$ be a locally compact group, $\mathscr C\overset{q}{\to}{\sf G}$ a Fell bundle and $\mathfrak B=L^1({\sf G}\,\vert\,\mathscr C)$ the algebra of integrable cross-sections associated to the bundle. We give conditions that guarantee the automatic continuity of an intertwining operator $\theta:\mathcal X_1\to\mathcal X_2$, where $\mathcal X_1$ is a Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule and $\mathcal X_2$ is a weak Banach $\mathfrak B$-bimodule, in terms of the continuity ideal of $\theta$. We provide examples of algebras where this conditions are met, both in the case of derivations and algebra morphisms. In particular, we show that, if ${\sf G}$ is infinite, finitely-generated, has polynomial growth and $\alpha$ is a free (partial) action of ${\sf G}$ on the compact space $X$, then every homomorphism of $\ell^1_\alpha({\sf G},C(X))$ into a Banach algebra is automatically continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is strictly sign regular/SSR (or sign regular/SR) if for each $1 \leq k \leq \min \{ m, n \}$, all (non-zero) $k\times k$ minors of $A$ have the same sign. This class of matrices contains the totally positive matrices, and was first studied by Schoenberg (1930) to characterize Variation Diminution (VD), a fundamental property in total positivity theory. In this note, we classify all surjective linear mappings $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\to\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ that preserve: (i) sign regularity and (ii) sign regularity with a given sign pattern, as well as (iii) strict versions of these.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time averages for the norm of solutions to kinetic Fokker--Planck equations associated with general Hamiltonians. We provide fully explicit and constructive decay estimates for systems subject to a confining potential, allowing fat-tail, sub-exponential and (super-)exponential local equilibria, which also include the classic Maxwellian case. The key step in our estimates is a modified Poincar\'e inequality, obtained via a Lions--Poincar\'e inequality and an averaging lemma.</description>

Abstract: We study multiplicity-free representations of Lie groups over a quasi-symmetric Siegel domain, with a focus on certain two-step nilpotent Lie groups. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the multiplicity-freeness property to hold. Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the disjointness of irreducible unitary representations realized over the domain, the multiplicity-freeness of the unitary representation on the Bergman space, and the coisotropicity of the group action.</description>
