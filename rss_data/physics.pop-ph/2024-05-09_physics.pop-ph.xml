      <title>Detectability of Solar Panels as a Technosignature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we assess the potential detectability of solar panels made of silicon on an Earth-like exoplanet as a potential technosignature. Silicon-based photovoltaic cells have high reflectance in the UV-VIS and in the near-IR, within the wavelength range of a space-based flagship mission concept like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Assuming that only solar energy is used to provide the 2022 human energy needs with a land cover of ~2.4%, and projecting the future energy demand assuming various growth-rate scenarios, we assess the detectability with an 8 m HWO-like telescope. Assuming the most favorable viewing orientation, and focusing on the strong absorption edge in the ultraviolet-to-visible (0.34 - 0.52 um), we find that several 100s of hours of observation time is needed to reach a SNR of 5 for an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at 10pc, even with a solar panel coverage of ~23% land coverage of a future Earth. We discuss the necessity of concepts like Kardeshev Type I/II civilizations and Dyson spheres, which would aim to harness vast amounts of energy. Even with much larger populations than today, the total energy use of human civilization would be orders of magnitude below the threshold for causing direct thermal heating or reaching the scale of a Kardashev Type I civilization. Any extraterrrestrial civilization that likewise achieves sustainable population levels may also find a limit on its need to expand, which suggests that a galaxy-spanning civilization as imagined in the Fermi paradox may not exist.</description>

      <title>On minimizing cyclists' ascent times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given an average power, the ascent time is minimized if a cyclist maintains a constant ground speed regardless of the slope. Herein, minimizing the time is equivalent to maximizing -- for a given uphill -- the corresponding mean ascent velocity (VAM: velocit\`a ascensionale media), which is a common training metric. We illustrate the proof with numerical examples, and show that, in general, maintaining a constant instantaneous power results in longer ascent times; both strategies result in the same time if the slope is constant. To remain within the athlete's capacity, we examine the effect of complementing the average-power constraint with a maximum-power constraint. Even with this additional constraint, the ascent time is the shortest with a modified constant-speed -- not constant-power -- strategy; as expected, both strategies result in the same time if the maximum and average powers are equal to one another. Given standard available information -- including level of fitness, quantified by the power output, and ascent profile -- our results allow to formulate reliable and convenient strategies of uphill timetrials.</description>
