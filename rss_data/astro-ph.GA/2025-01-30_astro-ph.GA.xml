      <title>BASS XLVII: 22 GHz Radio Atlas of Swift-BAT Selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the third phase of the largest high-frequency, high-resolution imaging survey of 231 nearby, hard X-ray selected AGN, with a very high $98 \pm 1\%$ detection fraction. This survey presents VLA 22 GHz radio observations with 1" spatial resolution covering over $6$ orders of magnitude in radio luminosity in nearby AGN that span $\sim4$ orders of magnitude in black hole mass and X-ray luminosity. We identify three different radio morphologies: $44 \pm 3\%$ (102/231) are compact or unresolved, $46 \pm 3\%$ (106/231) show an extended structure (star formation, possible one-sided jets, etc.), and $8 \pm 2\%$ (19/231) have a biconical or two-sided jet-like morphology. The remaining $2 \pm 1\%$ (4/231) sources are non-detections. The radio-to-X-ray luminosity ratios of the Swift-BAT AGN ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{14-195 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5.5}$ and $\text{L}_R/\text{L}_{2-10 \text{keV}} \sim 10^{-5}$) with a scatter of $\sim0.5$ dex are similar to that of coronally active stars ($\text{L}_R/\text{L}_X \sim 10^{-5}$). For most targets, extended emission in radio-quiet objects is broadly consistent with the expectation for star formation from previous FIR observations, once the contribution from the radio core has been subtracted. Our sample represents nearby analogs of distant AGN at the peak of black hole growth, and thus the high detection fraction in our work has important implications for future high frequency AGN radio surveys with the next generation VLA (ngVLA) or Square Kilometre Array (SKA), both of which should detect large fractions of more distant AGN.</description>

      <title>Tidal tails of nearby open clusters I. Mapping with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Tidal tails of open clusters are the result of stellar evaporation from the cluster through the Galactic potential and internal dynamics. With the recent availability of high-precision data, tidal tails are being detected for most of the nearby open clusters. Aims: We identify the tidal tail members for all open clusters within a distance of 400 pc that are older than 100 Myr and have $&gt;$100 members. To do this, we use model-independent methods. Methods: We used the convergent-point (CP) method to identify the co-moving stars near the open clusters using Gaia DR3 data. A new method called the self-compact convergent-point (SCCP) method was proposed and applied to some of the clusters. It performed better overall in tracing the tails. We also analysed the colour-magnitude diagrams and orbital energy to diagnose possible contamination. Results: Nineteen out of 21 clusters have tidal tails. Five of them were discovered for the first time through this work. The typical span of the tidal tails is 20--200 pc, and 30--700 member stars lie in the region inside the tidal radius and the tidal tails. Four out of 19 tidal tails are tilted away from direction of the Galactic centre. This contradicts the known theory of the tidal-tail formation. The luminosity functions of the tails and clusters are consistent with each other and with the canonical stellar interstellar mass function, but systematically higher radial velocities for the trailing tail than for the leading tail were observed for the first time. Conclusions: The CP method is useful for detecting tidal tails on a scale of approx. 100 pc for clusters closer than 400 pc. A further analysis of theoretical N-body models is required to understand the incompleteness and biases in the current sample of tidal tails.</description>

      <title>The assembly of supermassive black holes at $z&lt;1$ in early-type galaxies from scaling relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assembly of supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\bullet}$) and stellar mass ($M_{*}$) in galaxies can be studied via the redshift evolution of the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation, but the ways in which selection bias and physical assembly channels affect this evolution are uncertain. To address this, we compare the $M_{\bullet}-M_{*}$ relation for local massive ($M_{*}&gt;10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$) quiescent early-type galaxies (ETGs) to that for massive ETGs hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z\sim0.8$. The restrictions on stellar mass and galaxy type limit the assembly channels that may connect the two relations. For the local sample we find $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.80 + 1.10(\log{M_{*}-11})$, in line with prior work. For the $z\sim0.8$ sample we find a bias-corrected relation: $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 7.80 + 1.25(\log{M_{*}-11})$. We show, however, that this relation depends on the stellar and SMBH mass functions used to compute the selection bias, the virial relation, the virial factor, and the active fraction, which together introduce uncertainty of up to $\sim0.6$\,dex in the $z\sim0.8$ relation. Adopting reasonable choices of these parameters then our $z\sim0.8$ relation lies above that for $z\sim0$ AGN by $\sim0.5$\,dex, but below our $z\sim0$ ETG relation by $0.4-1$\,dex in SMBH mass. We discuss possible sources of this offset, including further bias corrections, `downsizing" in SMBH mass assembly, and preferential SMBH growth. Our results highlight the need to reduce uncertainties from selection and measurement bias in SMBH and stellar masses at all redshifts.</description>

      <title>Joint inference of the Milky Way star formation history and IMF from Gaia all-sky $G &lt; 13$ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the fundamental importance of the star formation history (SFH) and the initial mass function (IMF) in the description of the Milky Way, their consistent and robust derivation is still elusive. Recent and accurate astrometry and photometry collected by the Gaia satellite provide the natural framework to consolidate these ingredients in our local Galactic environment. We aim to simultaneously infer the IMF and the SFH of the Galactic disc comparing Gaia data with the mock catalog resulting from the Besan\c{c}on population synthesis model (BGM). Our goal is also to estimate the impact of the systematics present in current stellar evolutionary models on this inference. We use a new implementation of the BGM Fast Approximate Simulations (BGM FASt) framework to fit the seven million star Gaia DR3 all-sky $G&lt;13$ color-magnitude diagram (CMD) to the most updated dynamically self-consistent BGM. Our derived SFH supports an abrupt decrease of the star formation approximately 1-1.5 Gyr ago followed by a significant enhancement with a wide plateau in the range 2-6 Gyr ago. A remarkable hiatus appears around 5-7 Gyr ago with a $\sim$1 Gyr shift depending on the set of stellar models. A complex and discrepant evolution at ages older than 8 Gyr deserves further investigation. Precise but discrepant values are found for the power-law indices of the IMF. For the range 0.5-1.53 $M_\odot$ the slope takes a value of $\alpha_2 = 1.45^{+0.19}_{-0.12}$, while for masses larger than 1.53 $M_\odot$ we obtain $\alpha_3 = 1.98^{+0.13}_{-0.05}$. The current implementation of the BGM FASt framework is ready to address executions fitting all-sky Gaia data up to 14-17 apparent limiting magnitude. This will naturally allow us to derive both a reliable SFH for the early epochs of the Galactic disc evolution and a precise slope for the IMF at low masses.</description>

      <title>The First SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey. Characterization of clusters of galaxies misclassified in the eRASS1 point source catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of the extended X-ray-emission of the intracluster medium by the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1), combined with optical and near-infrared follow-up, resulted in the identification of more than 12000 galaxy clusters, yielding precise constraints on cosmological parameters. However, some clusters of galaxies can be misclassified as point sources by eROSITA's source detection algorithm due to the interplay between the point-spread function, the shallow depth of the survey, compact (cool core) X-ray emission, and bright active galactic nuclei hosted in their centers or their vicinity. To identify such misclassified galaxy clusters and groups, we apply optical follow-up to the eRASS1 X-ray point sources analogously to the treatment of the extent-selected catalog. After rigorous filtering to ensure purity, we find a total of 8347 clusters of galaxies, of which 5819 are novel detections, in a redshift range $0.05 &lt; z \lesssim 1.1$. This corresponds to a 70 % discovery rate, a fraction similar to that of the extent-selected sample. To facilitate finding new exceptional clusters such as the Phoenix cluster (which is recovered in our sample), we divide the clusters into five classes based on the optical properties of likely single-source counterparts to the X-ray emission. We further investigate potential biases in our selection process by analyzing the optical and X-ray data. With this work, we provide a catalog of galaxy clusters and groups in the eRASS1 point source catalog, including their optical and X-ray properties along with a meaningful classification.</description>

      <title>The impact of cosmic ray feedback during the epoch of reionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies form and evolve via a multitude of complex physics. In this work, we investigate the role of cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution and reionisation, by examining its impact on the escape of ionising radiation from galaxies. For this purpose, we present two Sphinx cosmological radiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulations, allowing for the first time a study of the impact of CR feedback on thousands of resolved galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR). The simulations differ in their feedback prescriptions: one adopts a calibrated strong supernova (SN) feedback, while the other simulation reduces the strength of SN feedback and includes CR feedback instead. We show that both comparably regulate star formation, reasonably match observations of high-redshift UV luminosity functions, and produce a similar amount of hydrogen ionising photons. In contrast to the model with strong SN feedback, the model with CRs lead to incomplete reionisation, which is in strong disagreement with observational estimates of the reionisation history. This is due to CR feedback shaping the ISM differently, filling with gas the low density cavities otherwise carved by SN explosions. As a result, this reduces the escape of ionising photons, at any halo mass, and primarily in the close vicinity of the stars. Our study indicates that CR feedback regulates galaxy growth during the EoR, but negatively affects reionisation, a tension which paves the way for further exploration and refinement of existing galaxy formation and feedback models. Such improvements are crucial in order to capture and understand the process of reionisation and the underlying evolution of galaxies through cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Molecular Gas Heating, Star Formation Rate Relations, and AGN Feedback in Infrared-luminous Galaxy Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the origin of molecular gas heating in a sample of 42 infrared-luminous galaxies at $z&lt;0.3$ by combining two sets of archival data. First, integrated CO line luminosities in the 1-0 and 5-4 through 13-12 transitions. Second, results from radiative transfer modelling that decompose their bolometric emission into starburst, AGN, and host galaxy components. We find that the CO 1-0 and 5-4 through 9-8 lines primarily arise via radiative heating in the starburst and the host galaxy. In contrast, the CO 10-9 through 13-12 lines may arise primarily in the starburst and AGN, with an increasing contribution from mechanical heating and shocks. For the sample as a whole, we find no evidence that AGN luminosity affects the heating of molecular gas by star formation. However, for starbursts with low initial optical depths, a more luminous AGN may reduce the efficiency of starburst heating of the CO 5-4 and above lines, consistent with negative AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Substructure: A Lensing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of dark matter substructure through strong gravitational lensing has shown enormous promise in probing the properties of dark matter on sub-galactic scales. This approach has already been used to place strong constraints on a wide range of dark matter models including self-interacting dark matter, fuzzy dark matter and warm dark matter. A major source of degeneracy exists between suppression of low mass halos due to novel dark matter physics and the strength of tidal stripping experienced by subhalos. We study theoretical predictions for the statistical properties of subhalos in strong gravitational lenses using the semi-analytic galaxy formation toolkit: \galns. We present a large suite of dark matter only \gal models, spanning nearly two orders of magnitude in host halo mass (from Milky Way to group mass halos between redshifts from $0.2$ to $0.8$). Additionally, we include a smaller set of \gal runs with the potential of a central massive elliptical to complement our dark matter only suite of models. We place particular focus on quantities relevant to strong gravitational lensing; namely the projected number density of substructure near the Einstein radius as function of host stellar mass and redshift. In the innermost region in projection, we find that our \gal models agrees with N-body simulations within a factor of $\sim 2$ within the Einstein radius. We find that the addition of a central galaxy suppresses the projected number density of subhalos within in the Einstein radius by around $15\%$ relative to dark matter only simulations.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of "snow clouds" by unassociated stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that star-forming galaxies may host a substantial, dark reservoir of gas in the form of planetary-mass molecular clouds that are so cold that $\text{H}_{2}$ can condense. Here we investigate the process of tidal disruption of such "snow clouds" by close passage of field stars. We construct a suite of simulations using the hydrodynamic formalism introduced by Carter and Luminet, and use it to explore the properties of the resulting tidal debris. The debris streams are tiny structures that are highly over-pressured relative to the ambient ISM. They are also unusual in their composition -- initially consisting of cold, gaseous He together with $\text{H}_{2}$ "snowballs" that may be as much as a metre in size. Each stream expands and cools and is subsequently shocked as it ploughs through the ISM; the snowballs are gradually eroded by the shocked gas. Snowballs streaming through the shocked ISM create microstructured plasma that is somewhat reminiscent of the "scattering screens" revealed by radio-wave scintillation studies. However, the tidal disruption rate is too low to account for the observed number of scattering screens if, as we assume here, the stars and clouds have no prior physical association so that disruptions occur as a result of chance encounters between stars and clouds.</description>

      <title>Formation of first star clusters under the supersonic gas flow -- II. Critical halo mass and core mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and mass distribution of the first stars depend on various environmental factors in the early universe. We compare 120 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore how the baryonic streaming velocity (SV) relative to dark matter affects the formation of the first stars. We vary SV from zero to three times its cosmic root-mean-square value, $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV}=0-3$, and identify 20 representative halos from cosmological simulations. For each model, we follow the evolution of a primordial star-forming cloud from the first appearance of a dense core (with gas density &gt; $10^{6}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) until 2 Myr later. In each model, higher SV systematically delays the formation of primordial clouds, formed inside more massive halos ($10^{5}-10^{7}\,{\rm M}_\odot$), and promotes cloud-scale fragmentation and multiple-core formation. The number and total mass of dense cores increase with increasing SV. More than half of models with $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV} \ge 1.5$ form three or more dense cores in a single halo. In extreme cases, up to 25 cores form at once, which leaves a massive first star cluster. On the other hand, models with $v_{\rm SV}/\sigma_{\rm SV} \leq 1$ form only one or two cores in a halo. In addition, HD-cooling is often enabled in models with low SV, especially in low-z, where HD-cooling is enabled in more than 50% of models. This leads to the formation of the low-mass first star. SV shapes the resulting initial mass function of the first stars and plays a critical role in setting the star-forming environment of the first galaxies.</description>

      <title>Core mass function in view of fractal and turbulent filaments and fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the core mass function (CMF) can be driven by filament fragmentation. To model a star-forming system of filaments and fibers, we develop a fractal and turbulent tree with a fractal dimension of 2 and a Larson's law exponent ($\beta$) of 0.5. The fragmentation driven by convergent flows along the splines of the fractal tree yields a Kroupa-IMF-like CMF that can be divided into three power-law segments with exponents $\alpha$ = $-0.5$, $-1.5$, and $-2$, respectively. The turnover masses of the derived CMF are approximately four times those of the Kroupa IMF, corresponding to a star formation efficiency of 0.25. Adopting $\beta=1/3$, which leads to fractional Brownian motion along the filament, may explain a steeper CMF at the high-mass end, with $\alpha=-3.33$ close to that of the Salpeter IMF. We suggest that the fibers of the tree are basic building blocks of star formation, with similar properties across different clouds, establishing a common density threshold for star formation and leading to a universal CMF.</description>

      <title>A Semi-analytic Framework of Population III and Subsequent Galaxy Formation on Ultralarge Cosmological N-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new semi-analytic framework of Population (Pop) III and subsequent galaxy formation designed to run on dark matter halo merger trees. In our framework, we consider the effect of the Lyman-Werner flux from Pop III and II stars and the dark matter baryon streaming velocity on the critical minihalo mass for the Pop III formation. Our model incorporates the Lyman-Werner feedback in a self-consistent way, therefore, the spatial variation of Lyman-Werner feedback naturally emerges. The Pop III mass depends on the properties of a minihalo as reproducing radiative hydrodynamical simulation results. We perform statistical studies of Pop III stars by applying this framework to high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations with a maximum box size of 16 Mpc/h and enough mass resolution to resolve Pop III-forming minihalos. A top-heavy initial mass function emerges and two peaks corresponding to the H$_2$ ($20 \lesssim z \lesssim 25$) and atomic cooling halos ($z \lesssim 15$) exist in the distribution. Supermassive stars can be formed in the atomic cooling halos, and the fractions of such supermassive stars increase with the value of streaming velocity. At least an 8 Mpc/h simulation box and the self-consistent model for the Lyman-Werner feedback are necessary to correctly model the Pop III formation in the atomic cooling halos. Our model predicts one supermassive star per halo with several $10^9$ Msun at z=7.5, which is enough to reproduce a high redshift quasar.</description>

      <title>Hydroxylamine in Astrophysical Ices: IR Spectra and Cosmic Ray-Induced Radiolytic Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-phase hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH) has recently been detected within dense clouds in the interstellar medium. However, it is also likely present within interstellar ices, as well as on the icy surfaces of outer Solar System bodies, where it may react to form more complex prebiotic molecules such as amino acids. In this work, we aimed to provide IR spectra of NH$_2$OH in astrophysical ice analogues that will help in the search for this molecule in various astrophysical environments. Furthermore, we aimed to provide quantitative information on the stability of NH$_2$OH upon exposure to ionizing radiation analogous to cosmic rays, as well as on the ensuing chemistry and potential formation of complex prebiotic molecules. Ices composed of NH$_2$OH, H$_2$O, and CO were prepared by vapor deposition and IR spectra were acquired between $4000-500$~cm$^{-1}$ ($2.5-20 \mu$m) prior and during irradiation using 15 keV protons. In interstellar ice analogues, the most prominent IR absorption band of NH$_2$OH is that at about 1188~cm$^{-1}$, which may be a good candidate to use in searches of this species in icy space environments. Calculated effective destruction cross-sections and G-values for the NH$_2$OH-rich ices studied show that NH$_2$OH is rapidly destroyed upon exposure to ionizing radiation (more rapidly than a number of previously studied organic molecules), and that this destruction is slightly enhanced when it is mixed with other icy species. The irradiation of a NH$_2$OH:H$_2$O:CO ternary ice mixture leads to a rich chemistry that includes the formation of simple inorganic molecules such as NH$_3$, CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and H$_2$O$_2$, as well as ammonium salts and, possibly, complex organic molecules relevant to life such as formamide, formic acid, urea, and glycine.</description>

      <title>Searching for signatures of Fe II atomic processes in spectra of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a sample of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectra in order to investigate which atomic processes are responsible for some observed properties of the FeII emission lines and how they are connected with macroscopic physical characteristics of AGN emission regions. We especially focus on the violated relative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative strengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We investigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV FeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into two large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities are in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent (FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than theoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII model, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted independently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that produce strong inconsistent Fe II lines, and therefore, we investigated their correlations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of FeII$_{incons}$/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the Eddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that both ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines, which is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical FeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the FeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an increase in the optical depth in FeII lines, which results in the triggering of the process of self-absorption. The observed FeII spectrum is probably a complex mixture of radiation from emission regions with different physical conditions.</description>

      <title>Glimmers in the Cosmic Dawn. II. A variability census of supermassive black holes across the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBH) stands as one of the most important challenges in astrophysics and cosmology, with little current theoretical consensus. Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 years earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analysed. We identify 443, 149, and 78 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2, 2.5 and 3~$\sigma$ in at least one filter. This sample includes 29, 14, and 9 AGN at redshifts $z&gt;6$, when the Universe was $\lesssim900$~Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17\:$mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the co-moving number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}(z)$. At $z = 6 - 9$, $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. At low-$z$ our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17 \:$mag, and we estimate $n_{\rm SMBH}\gtrsim 6\times 10^{-2}\:{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$. We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.</description>

      <title>Rotational Excitation of Vinyl Cyanide by Collisions with Helium Atoms at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the numerous molecular systems found in the interstellar medium (ISM), vinyl cyanide is the first identified olephinic nitrile. While it has been observed in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the 2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates that local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an accurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves solving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the competition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn requires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the most abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional CH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly correlated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two basis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical close-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross sections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding rate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a global minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional cross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are determined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions with $\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.</description>

      <title>The evolution of extragalactic peaked-spectrum sources down to 54 megahertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peaked-spectrum (PS) sources, known for their distinct peaked radio spectra, represent a type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Among these, megahertz-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources, which exhibit a spectral peak at a frequency of a hundred megahertz, have emerged as a potential tool for identifying high-redshift candidates. However, the potential evolutionary link between the fraction of these sources and redshift remains unclear and requires further investigation. The recent, high sensitivity Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) surveys enable statistical studies of these objects to ultra-low frequencies (&lt; 150 MHz). In this study, we first use the multiradio data to investigate the evolution of spectral index with redshift for 1,187 quasars from the SDSS 16th quasar catalog. For each quasar, we analyze available data from the LOFAR Low Band Antenna (LBA) at 54 MHz, High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz, and the Very Large Array (VLA) the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz. We measure the spectral index ($\alpha^{144}_{54}$ and $\alpha^{1400}_{144}$) and find no significant change in their median values with the redshift. Extended sources have steeper spectral indices than compact sources, which is consistent with previous findings. Based on the spectral indices information, we identify MPS sources using these criteria: $\rm \alpha^{144}_{54} &gt;= 0.1$ and $\rm \alpha^{1400}_{144} &lt; 0$, and analyze their properties. We find that the fraction of MPS sources is constant with the redshift ($0.1-4.8$), bolometric luminosity ($\rm 10^{44}-10^{48} erg/s$), and supermassive black hole mass ($\rm 10^{7}-10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$), which suggests that MPS sources have relatively stable physical conditions or formation mechanisms across various evolutionary stages and environments.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Target List of Ice Sources (SPLICES)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary objectives of the SPHEREx mission is to understand the origin of molecules such as H2O, CO2, and other volatile compounds at the early stages of planetary system formation. Because the vast majority of these compounds -- typically exceeding 95% -- exist in the solid phase rather than the gaseous phase in the systems of concern here, the observing strategy planned to characterize them is slightly unusual. Specifically, SPHEREx will target highly obscured sources throughout the Milky Way, and observe the species of concern in absorption against background illumination. SPHEREx spectrophotometry will yield ice column density measurements for millions of obscured Milky Way sources of all ages and types. By correlating those column densities with source ages, the SPHEREx mission will shed light on whether those molecules were formed in situ along with their nascent stellar systems, or whether instead they formed elsewhereand were introduced into those systems after their formation. To that end, this work describes version 7.1 of the SPHEREx Target List of Ice Sources (SPLICES) for the community. It contains about 8.6 million objects brighter than W2~12 Vega mag over much of the sky, principally within a broad strip running the length of the Milky Way midplane, but also within high-latitude molecular clouds and even the Magellanic Clouds.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength and Environmental Properties of Variability Selected Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the multi-wavelength and environmental properties of 37 variability-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including 30 low luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs), using a high cadence time-domain survey (ASAS-SN) from a spectroscopic sample of 1218 nearby bright galaxies. We find that high-cadence time-domain surveys uniquely select LLAGNs that do not necessarily satisfy other AGN selection methods, such as X-ray, mid-IR, or BPT methods. In our sample, 3% of them pass the mid-infrared color based AGN selection, 18% pass the X-ray luminosity based AGN selection, and 60% pass the BPT selection. This result is supported by two other LLAGN samples from high-cadence time-domain surveys of TESS and PTF, suggesting that the variability selection method from well-sampled light curves can find AGNs that may not be discovered otherwise. These AGNs can have moderate to small amplitudes of variability from the accretion disk, but, of many of them, with no strong corona, emission lines from the central engine, or accretion power to dominate the mid-IR emission. The X-ray spectra of a sub-sample of bright sources are consistent with a power law model. Upon inspecting the environments of our sample, we find that LLAGNs are more common in denser environments of galaxy clusters in contrast with the trend established in the literature for luminous AGNs at low redshifts, which is broadly consistent with our analysis result for luminous AGNs limited by a smaller sample size. This contrast in environmental properties between LLAGN and luminous AGNs suggests that LLAGNs may have different trigger mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the close binary open clusters CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, which are in close spatial proximity, using photometric and astrometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 catalog. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), resulting in 106 and 146 members for CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, respectively. The mean proper motion components ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta$, $\mu_{\delta}$) were determined to be (0.646$\pm$0.155, -0.769$\pm$0.124) mas yr$^{-1}$ for CWNU 2666, and (0.665$\pm$0.131, -0.728$\pm$0.107) mas yr$^{-1}$ for HSC 224. The isochrone distances ($d_{\rm iso}$) were estimated as 1885$\pm$44 pc for CWNU 2666 and 1866$\pm$29 pc for HSC 224. The corresponding cluster ages ($t$) were derived as 160$\pm$15 Myr and 140$\pm$15 Myr, respectively. The astrometric and fundamental astrophysical parameters derived in this study demonstrate that the two open clusters are a close pair of open clusters.</description>

      <title>Broadening of the Main Sequence of a Star Cluster by Undetected Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the spread in apparent magnitudes (or absolute magnitudes) of main-sequence stars in a star cluster. I specifically consider the effect of binary stars in broadening the main sequence. I present analytic and semi-analytic expressions for the probability density function (pdf) of the magnitude at a given photometric color, including the effects of binarity. The expressions obtained employ plausible models for the pdfs of the magnitudes of the primary and secondary stars, as well as the distribution of secondary-to-primary mass ratio. A crucial parameter is the fraction of stars in the star cluster that are binaries. The resultant formulas can be used to determine the fraction of binaries in a sample of stars taken from a star cluster, or to limit long term variations in the luminosity of solar type stars.</description>

      <title>Testing Cluster Membership of Planetary Nebulae with High-Precision Proper Motions. II. HST Observations of PHR J1315-6555 in the Open Cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) shown to be members of star clusters provide information on their properties and evolutionary histories that cannot be determined for PNe in the field, in particular the initial masses of their progenitor stars. Here we investigate the bipolar PN PHR J1315-6555 (hereafter PHR J1315), which lies near the open cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04) on the sky. Previous work has established that the PN and cluster have similar radial velocities and amounts of interstellar reddening, and similar distances estimated using independent methods. We have obtained new images of the PN and cluster using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Combined with archival HST frames taken 12 years earlier, they provide high-precision proper motions (PMs) for two candidate central stars of PHR J1315. We find that the PMs of both candidates are consistent with those of cluster members, strongly confirming the PN's membership in AL 1. The candidate lying closer to the center of PHR J1315 has the color and luminosity of an early F-type dwarf, suggesting that it may be the optical primary in a close post-common-envelope binary. We used the HST data to construct a color-magnitude diagram for AL 1, which we corrected for significant foreground differential reddening. Isochrone fitting reveals that the cluster lies at a remarkably large distance of about 13 kpc, and has an age of about 1.0 Gyr. The initial mass of the progenitor of PHR J1315 was about 2.1 Msun. We suggest followup investigations that would provide tighter constraints on the object's evolution.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) VI. Evidence of disk-wind in G11.92-0.61 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic disk-winds play a key role in the formation of massive stars by providing the fine-tuning between accretion and ejection, where excess angular momentum is redirected away from the disk, allowing further mass growth. However, only a limited number of disk-wind sources have been detected to date. To better constrain the exact mechanism of this phenomenon, expanding the sample is critical. We performed an analysis of the disk-wind candidate G11.92-0.61 MM1 by estimating the physical parameters of the system and constraining the wind-launching mechanism. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations were conducted in September 2021 with ALMA's longest baselines, which provided a synthesised beam of $\sim$30 mas. We obtained high-resolution images of the CH$_3$CN ($v_8=1$ and $v=0$), CH$_3$OH, SO$_2$, and SO molecular lines, and the 1.3 mm continuum. Our molecular data allowed us to refine the parameters of the disk-outflow system in MM1. The rotating disk is resolved into two regions with distinct kinematics: the inner region ($&lt;$300 au) is traced by high-velocity emission of high-excitation CH$_3$CN lines and shows a Keplerian rotation; the outer region ($&gt;$300 au), traced by mid-velocity CH$_3$CN emission, rotates in a sub-Keplerian regime. The central source is estimated to be $\sim$20 $M_{\odot}$, which is about half the mass estimated in previous lower-resolution studies. A strong collimated outflow is traced by SO and SO$_2$ emission up to $\sim$3400 au around MM1a. The SO and SO$_2$ emissions show a rotation-dominated velocity pattern, a constant specific angular momentum, and a Keplerian profile that suggests a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind origin with launching radii of $\sim$50-100 au. G11.92-0.61 MM1 appears to be one of the clearest cases of molecular line-traced disk-winds detected around massive protostars.</description>

      <title>Velocity Structure of Circumstellar Environment around Class 0/I Protostars: Uncertainty in the Protostellar Mass Estimation Using Circumstellar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim \! 100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Ion-kinetic-energy sampling in a 22-pole trap using ring-electrode evaporation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental method for the characterization of the kinetic energies of ions confined in a 22-pole radio frequency trap by inducing a small potential barrier using the surrounding ring electrodes, allowing the selective extraction of ions. Energy sampling experiments have been performed on buffer gas thermalized He$^+$ ions at trap temperatures between 10-180 K, resulting in distinct extraction curves as a function of the potential barrier, and a differentiated behavior depending on the escape time from the trap. The experiments are complemented by Monte Carlo simulations of the ion trajectories inside the calculated trap potential and allow us to investigate the properties of the sampling method, the role of ion motion coupling, and the impact of residual buffer gas collisions on the observed results. The technique has also been successfully applied to identify energetic H$_3^+$ ions produced in an exothermic reaction inside the trap. Upon calibration, this method can provide relative kinetic energy distributions or be used to filter the maximum desired kinetic energy of the ions inside the trap.</description>

      <title>NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, a Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\approx$ 5. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Galactic Winds at Cosmic Noon: Outflow Kinematics and Mass Loading in a Lensed Star-Forming Galaxy at $z=1.87$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spatially resolved outflow properties of CSWA13, an intermediate mass ($M_*=10^{9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), gravitationally lensed star-forming galaxy at $z=1.87$. We use Keck/KCWI to map outflows in multiple rest-frame ultraviolet ISM absorption lines, along with fluorescent Si II$^*$ emission, and nebular emission from C III] tracing the local systemic velocity. The spatial structure of outflow velocity mirrors that of the nebular kinematics, which we interpret to be a signature of a young galactic wind that is pressurizing the ISM of the galaxy but is yet to burst out. From the radial extent of Si II$^*$ emission, we estimate that the outflow is largely encapsulated within $3.5$ kpc. We explore the geometry (e.g., patchiness) of the outflow by measuring the covering fraction at different velocities, finding that the maximum covering fraction is at velocities $v\simeq-150$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$. Using the outflow velocity ($v_{out}$), radius ($R$), column density ($N$), and solid angle ($\Omega$) based on the covering fraction, we measure the mass loss rate $\log\dot{m}_{out}/(\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}) = 1.73\pm0.23$ and mass loading factor $\log\eta = 0.04\pm0.34$ for the low-ionization outflowing gas in this galaxy. These values are relatively large and the bulk of the outflowing gas is moving with speeds less than the escape velocity of the galaxy halo, suggesting that the majority of outflowing mass will remain in the circumgalactic medium and/or recycle back into the galaxy. The results support a picture of high outflow rates transporting mass and metals into the inner circumgalactic medium, providing the gas reservoir for future star formation.</description>

      <title>Near-IR clumps and their properties in high-z galaxies with JWST/NIRCam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolved stellar morphology of $z&gt;1$ galaxies was inaccessible before JWST. This limitation, due to the impact of dust on rest-frame UV light, had withheld major observational conclusions required to understand the importance of clumps in galaxy evolution. Essentially independent of this issue, we use the rest-frame near-IR for a stellar-mass dependent clump detection method and determine reliable estimations of selection effects. We exploit publicly available JWST/NIRCam and HST/ACS imaging data from CEERS, to create a stellar-mass based picture of clumps in a mass-complete sample of 418 galaxies within a wide wavelength coverage of $0.5-4.6\,\mu$m and a redshift window of $1 &lt; z &lt; 2$. We find that a near-IR detection gives access to a larger, and possibly different, set of clumps within galaxies, with those also detected in UV making up only $28\%$. Whereas, $85\%$ of the UV clumps are found to have a near-IR counterpart. These near-IR clumps closely follow the UVJ classification of their respective host galaxies, with these hosts mainly populating the star-forming regime besides a fraction of them ($16\%$) that can be considered quiescent. The mass of the detected clumps are found to be within the range of $10^{7.5-9.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, therefore expected to drive gas into galaxy cores through tidal torques. The clump stellar mass function is found to have a slope of $-1.50 \pm 0.14$, indicating a hierarchical nature similar to that of star-forming regions in the local Universe. Finally, we observe a radial gradient of increasing clump mass towards the centre of galaxies.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: III. The formation of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model of globular cluster (GC) formation within the cosmological hierarchy of structure formation. The model is rooted in the `two-phase' scenario of galaxy formation developed in Paper-I, where the fast accretion of dark matter halos at high redshift leads to the formation of self-gravitating, turbulent gas clouds that subsequently fragment into dynamically hot systems of dense sub-clouds with masses $\sim 10^6$-$10^7 M_\odot$. Here we elaborate on the formation, evolution, and fate of these sub-clouds, and show that some of the sub-clouds can be compactified via two distinctive channels into a 'supernova-free' regime to form two distinct populations of GCs. The model is simple, characterized by a small number of free parameters underpinned by physical considerations, and can be efficiently implemented into cosmological N-body simulations to generate a coherent sample of halos, galaxies, and GCs. Our model can reproduce a range of observations on GCs, including the mass function, the size-mass relation, the frequency per unit host galaxy/halo mass, the bimodal metallicity distribution, and the spatial profile. Predictions for GCs are made for both the local Universe and for redshift up to $z \approx 10$, and can be tested by upcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Modelling the evolution of the Galactic disc scale height traced by open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The scale height of the spatial distribution of open clusters (OCs) in the Milky Way exhibits a well known increase with age which is usually interpreted as evidence for dynamical heating of the disc or of the disc having been thicker in the past.
  Aims. We address the increase of the scale height with age of the OC population from a different angle. We propose that the apparent thickening of the disc can be largely explained as a consequence of a stronger disruption of OCs near the Galactic plane by disc phenomena, namely encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs).
  Methods. We present a computational model that forms OCs with different initial masses and follows their orbits while subjecting them to different disruption mechanisms. To setup the model and infer its parameters, we use and analyse a Gaia-based OC catalogue (Dias et al. 2021). We investigate both the spatial and age distributions of the OC population and discuss the completeness of the sample. The simulation results are then compared to the observations.
  Results. Consistent with previous studies, the observations reveal that the SH of the spatial distribution of OCs increases with age. We find that it is very likely that the OC sample is incomplete even for the solar neighbourhood. The model simulations successfully reproduce the SH increase with age and the total number of OCs that survive with age up to 1 Gyr. For older OCs, the predicted SH from the model starts deviating from the observations, although remaining within the uncertainties of the observations. This can be related with effects of incompleteness and/or simplifications in the model.
  Conclusions. A selective disruption of OCs near the galactic plane through GMC encounters is able to explain the SH evolution of the OC population.</description>

      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics IV: Non Rotating Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At it stands, the $\Lambda CDM$ model does not anticipate the early emergence of massive galaxies. Canonical Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) seems to fail at late time solar system scale and Wide-Binary scales. To match data, a MOND variant needs a variable MOND acceleration $a_0$ which is strong at high redshift galactic scale and diminishes over redshift to far below Newtonian gravity at solar system scale at late time. We found such a candidate in a relativistic frame-work. In a previous work, a new single-metric solution of Einstein Gravity is found for a point mass residing in an expanding universe, which apart from the Newtonian acceleration, gives rise to an additional MOND-like acceleration in which the MOND acceleration $a_0$ is replaced by the cosmological acceleration $\frac{1}{2}H^2(z)r$. This cosmological acceleration is shown to be far below Newtonian acceleration in the solar system. In this work, we study the monolithic evolution of a Milky Way mass protogalactic cloud at recombination in this model where the non-Newtonian acceleration is stronger than Newtonian gravity. To obtain a spherical galaxy we assume that a point on a mass shell at turnaround will pick up non-systematic angular momentum. Assuming a violent relaxation process similar to the simulation studies for MOND and Newtonian gravity, we find that the central core can form a time independent Quasi-Stationary-State (QSS) by z&gt;7, which could explain the galaxy morphology stability observations for $z&lt;6.5$. The virialised potential has a Newtonian acceleration dominant central region and a MOND-like acceleration dominant outer region. We evaluate the corresponding MOND acceleration $a_0^{VM}$ in a virialised potential for a Milky-Way mass elliptical galaxy and find that $a_0^{VM}\sim a_0$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the disky second generation of stars in globular clusters on cosmological timescale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Many Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations, challenging the traditional view of GCs as single-population systems. It has been suggested that second-generation stars could form in a disk from gas lost by first-generation stars or from external accreted gas. Aims. We investigate how the introduction of a second stellar generation affects mass loss, internal mixing, and rotational properties of GCs in a time-varying Galactic tidal field and different orbital configurations. Methods. We conducted direct N-body simulations of GCs on three types of orbits derived from the observed Milky Way GCs. We evolved the clusters for 8 Gyr in the time-varying Galactic potential of the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological simulation. After 2 Gyr, we introduced a second stellar generation, comprising 5% of the initial mass of the first generation, as a flattened disk of stars. For comparison, we ran control simulations using a static Galactic potential and isolated clusters. Results. We present the mass loss, structural evolution, and kinematic properties of GCs with two stellar generations, focusing on tidal mass, half-mass radii, velocity distributions, and angular momentum. Conclusions. Our results show that the mass loss of GCs depends primarily on their orbital parameters, with tighter orbits leading to higher mass loss. The Galaxy's growth resulted in tighter orbits, meaning GCs lost less mass than if its mass had always been constant. The initially flattened second-generation disk became nearly spherical within one relaxation time. However, whether its distinct rotational signature was retained depends on the orbit: for the long radial orbit, it vanished quickly; for the tube orbit, it lasted several Gyr; but for the circular orbit, rotation persisted until the present day</description>

Abstract: Globular cluster (GC) streams, debris of stars that tidally stripped from their progenitor GCs, have densities that correlate positively with the GC mass loss rate. In this work, we employ a novel particle spray algorithm that can accurately reproduce the morphology of streams of various orbital types, enabling us to uncover the relationship between the GC mass loss history and stream density profiles. Using recent discoveries of GC streams from Gaia DR3, we present, for the first time, a catalog of directly observed mass loss rates for 12 Galactic GCs, ranging from 0.5 to 200 $\rm M_\odot\,Myr^{-1}$. By fitting power-law relations between mass loss rate and key GC properties, we identify positive correlations with GC mass and orbital frequency, consistent with the predictions from N-body simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark $\left(10^{6} M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}\right)$ Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semi-analytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old ($t \gtrsim 0.6$ Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of $\sim 0.1-0.5 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$ in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: kNN identification of perturbed galaxies through HI morphometrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy morphology in stellar light can be described by a series of "non-parametric" or "morphometric" parameters, such as concentration-asymmetry-smoothness, Gini, $M_{20}$, and Sersic fit. These parameters can be applied to column density maps of atomic hydrogen (HI). The HI distribution is susceptible to perturbations by environmental effects, e.g. inter-galactic medium pressure and tidal interactions. Therefore, HI morphology can potentially identify galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions. We explore three fields in the WALLABY Pilot HI survey and identify perturbed galaxies based on a k-nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm using an HI morphometric feature space. For training, we used labeled galaxies in the combined NGC 4808 and NGC 4636 fields with six HI morphometrics to train and test a kNN classifier. The kNN classification is proficient in classifying perturbed galaxies with all metrics -- accuracy, precision and recall -- at 70-80%. By using the kNN method to identify perturbed galaxies in the deployment field, the NGC 5044 mosaic, we find that in most regards, the scaling relations of perturbed and unperturbed galaxies have similar distribution in the scaling relations of stellar mass vs star formation rate and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, but the HI and stellar mass relation flatter than of the unperturbed galaxies. Our results for NGC 5044 provide a prediction for future studies on the fraction of galaxies undergoing interaction in this catalogue and to build a training sample to classify such galaxies in the full WALLABY survey.</description>

      <title>Dwarf galaxies imply dark matter is heavier than $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^{-21}} \, \mathbf{eV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely established that a lower bound on the dark matter particle mass, $m$, can be obtained by demanding that the de Broglie wavelength in a given galaxy must be smaller than the virial radius of the galaxy, leading to $m\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ when applied to typical dwarf galaxies. This lower limit has never been derived precisely or rigorously. We use stellar kinematical data for the Milky Way satellite galaxy Leo II to self-consistently reconstruct a statistical ensemble of dark matter wavefunctions and corresponding density profiles. By comparison to a data-driven, model-independent reconstruction, and using a variant of the maximum mean discrepancy as a statistical measure, we determine that a self-consistent description of dark matter in the local Universe requires $m&gt;2.2 \times 10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}\;\mathrm{(CL&gt;95\%)}$. This lower limit is free of any assumptions pertaining to cosmology, microphysics (including spin), or dynamics of dark matter, and only assumes that it is predominantly composed of a single bosonic particle species.</description>

      <title>High-definition imaging of a filamentary connection between a close quasar pair at z=3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filaments connecting halos are a long-standing prediction of cold dark matter theories. We present a detection of the cosmic web emission connecting two quasar-host galaxies at redshift z ~3.22 in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (MUDF). The very deep observations unlock a high-definition view of the filament morphology, a measure of the transition radius between the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium, and the characterization of the surface brightness profiles along the filament and in the transverse direction. Through systematic comparisons with simulations, we validate the filaments' typical density predicted in the current cold dark-matter model. Our analysis of the MUDF field, an excellent laboratory for quantitatively studying filaments in emission, opens a new avenue to constrain the physical properties of the cosmic web and to trace the distribution of dark matter on large scales.</description>

      <title>MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps: entering the HI dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from MeerKAT single-dish HI intensity maps, the final observations to be performed in L-band in the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) campaign. The observations represent the deepest single-dish HI intensity maps to date, produced from 41 repeated scans over $236\,{\rm deg}^2$, providing 62 hours of observational data for each of the 64 dishes before flagging. By introducing an iterative self-calibration process, the estimated thermal noise of the reconstructed maps is limited to ${\sim}\,1.21\,$mK ($1.2\,\times$ the theoretical noise level). This thermal noise will be sub-dominant relative to the HI fluctuations on large scales ($k\,{\lesssim}\,0.15\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$), which demands upgrades to power spectrum analysis techniques, particularly for covariance estimation. In this work, we present the improved MeerKLASS analysis pipeline, validating it on both a suite of mock simulations and a small sample of overlapping spectroscopic galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Despite only overlapping with ${\sim}\,25\%$ of the MeerKLASS deep field, and a conservative approach to covariance estimation, we still obtain a ${&gt;}\,4\,\sigma$ detection of the cross-power spectrum between the intensity maps and the 2269 galaxies at the narrow redshift range $0.39\,{&lt;}\,z\,{&lt;}\,0.46$. We briefly discuss the HI auto-power spectrum from this data, the detection of which will be the focus of follow-up work. For the first time with MeerKAT single-dish intensity maps, we also present evidence of HI emission from stacking the maps onto the positions of the GAMA galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic viscose accretion disk around a distorted kerr black hole (DKB)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze a thin disk around the distorted Kerr black hole (DKB) within the framework of general relativity using an axisymmetric solution of the Einstein equations. We consider this accretion disk around the Kerr black hole in an external gravitational field up to the quadrupole moment and discuss the key aspects of black hole accretion disk theory. Our findings indicate that the presence of a quadrupole moment significantly influences the radiation emitted from the accretion disk. While the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) remains largely unchanged, the magnitude of the radiation flux, as well as the shape, orientation, and energy distribution of the accretion disk, are affected. The direction of distortion of the event horizon determines whether the disk becomes more oblate or prolate, impacting observed variations in maximum height, position, and temperature. Furthermore, the quadrupole moment alters the geometry of the black hole's spacetime, which can influence the efficiency of energy extraction from the black hole's spin, an important factor in powering emissions from accretion disks. We obtain dynamical quantities around a distorted rotating black hole disk. Additionally, we examine how rotation influences the dynamics of the DKB. We also investigate the effects of varying the viscosity coefficient on the behavior of the DKB.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.</description>

      <title>Discovery of metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence candidates in WLM with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of twelve metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates in the dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)~968 kpc away, at a present-day metallicity of [Fe/H] around $-$0.9. These candidates have masses between 1.25-5 M$_{\odot}$, with ages &lt;10 Myr, and exhibit significant near-infrared excesses at 2.5 and 4.3 $\mu$m. They are concentrated within a cluster roughly 10 pc (2'') across situated in the HII region [HM95]-9. These are the most distant and metal-poor PMS stars known, and can offer new quantitative insights into star formation at low-metallicities.</description>
