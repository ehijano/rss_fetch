      <title>On the sensitivity of nuclear clocks to new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent demonstration of laser excitation of the $\approx 8$ eV isomeric state of thorium-229 is a significant step towards a nuclear clock. The low excitation energy likely results from a cancellation between the contributions of the electromagnetic and strong forces. Physics beyond the Standard Model could disrupt this cancellation, highlighting nuclear clocks' sensitivity to new physics. Accurate predictions of the different contributions to nuclear transition energies, and therefore of the quantitative sensitivity of a nuclear clock, are challenging. We improve upon previous sensitivity estimates and assess a ''nightmare scenario'', where all binding energy differences are small and the new physics sensitivity is poor. A classical geometric model of thorium-229 suggests that fine-tuning is needed for such a scenario. We also propose a $d$-wave halo model, inspired by effective field theory. We show that it reproduces observations and suggests the ''nightmare scenario'' is unlikely. We find that the nuclear clock's sensitivity to variations in the effective fine structure constant is enhanced by a factor of order $10^4$. We finally propose auxiliary nuclear measurements to reduce uncertainties and further test the validity of the halo model.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Data Acquisition System Architecture for the Nab Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nab experiment will measure the electron-neutrino correlation and Fierz interference term in free neutron beta decay to test the Standard Model and probe Beyond the Standard Model Physics. Using National Instrument's PXIe-5171 Reconfigurable Oscilloscope module, we have developed a data acquisition system that is not only capable of meeting Nab's specifications, but flexible enough to be adapted in situ as the experimental environment dictates. The L1 and L2 trigger logic can be reconfigured to optimize the system for coincidence event detection at runtime through configuration files and LabVIEW controls. This system is capable of identifying L1 triggers at at least $1$ MHz, while reading out a peak signal rate of approximately $2$ GB/s. During commissioning, the system ran at a sustained readout rate of $400$ MB/s of signal data originating from roughly $6$ kHz L2 triggers, well within the peak performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Review of nonflow estimation methods and uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective anisotropic flow, where particles are correlated over the entire event, is a prominent phenomenon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the properties of the matter created in those collisions. It is often measured by two- and multi-particle correlations and is therefore contaminated by nonflow, those genuine few-body correlations unrelated to the global event-wise correlations. Many methods have been devised to estimate nonflow contamination with various degrees of successes and difficulties. Here, we review those methods pedagogically, discussing the pros and cons of each method, and give examples of ballpark estimate of nonflow contamination and associated uncertainties in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We hope such a review of the various nonflow estimation methods in a single place would prove helpful to future researches.</description>

      <title>Novel method for in-situ drift velocity measurement in large volume TPCs: the Geometry Reference Chamber of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for low maintenance, low ambiguity in-situ drift velocity monitoring in large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). The method was developed and deployed for the 40m^3 TPC tracker system of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, which has a one meter of drift length. The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber placed next to the TPC to be monitored, downstream with respect to the particle flux. Reconstructed tracks in the TPC are matched to hits in the monitoring chamber, called the Geometry Reference Chamber (GRC). Relative differences in positions of hits in the GRC are used to estimate the drift velocity, removing the need for an accurate alignment of the TPC to the GRC. An important design requirement on the GRC was minimal added complexity to the existing system, in particular, compatibility with Front-End Electronics cards already used to read out the TPCs. Moreover, the GRC system was designed to operate both in large and small particle fluxes. The system is capable of monitoring the evolution of the drift velocity inside the TPC down to a one permil precision, with a few minutes of data collection.</description>

      <title>Qualitative explanation of the data on the decays $D^0\to a_0(980)^\pm\pi^\mp$ and $D^+\to a_0(980)^{+(0)}\pi^{0(+)}$ in the four-quark model of the $a_0(980)$ resonance</title>

Abstract: It is shown that the values of the ratios $\mathcal{B}(D^0\to a_0(980)^+\pi^-)/\mathcal{B} (D^0\to a_0(980)^-\pi^+ )$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to a_0(980)^+\pi^0)/\mathcal{B} (D^+\to a_0(980)^0 \pi^+)$, recently measured by the BESIII Collaboration, are naturally explained in the four-quark model of the $a_0(980) $ resonance.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ photoproduction: threshold to very high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A reaction model for $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ photoproduction, which exposes the $c \bar c$ content of the photon in making the transition $\gamma\to c\bar c + \mathbb P \to J/\psi$ and couples the intermediate $c \bar c$ system to the proton's valence quarks via Pomeron ($\mathbb P $) exchange, is used to deliver a description of available data, viz. both differential and total cross sections from near threshold, where data has newly been acquired, to invariant mass $W \approx 300\,$GeV. The study suggests that it is premature to link existing $\gamma + p \to J/\psi + p$ data with, for instance, in-proton gluon distributions, the quantum chromodynamics trace anomaly, or pentaquark production. Further developments in reaction theory and higher precision data are necessary before the validity of any such connections can be assessed.</description>
