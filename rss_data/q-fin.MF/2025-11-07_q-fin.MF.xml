      <title>Robust mean-field control under common noise uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a framework for discrete-time robust mean-field control problems under common noise uncertainty. In this framework, the mean-field interaction describes the collective behavior of infinitely many cooperative agents' state and action, while the common noise -- a random disturbance affecting all agents' state dynamics -- is uncertain. A social planner optimizes over open-loop controls on an infinite horizon to maximize the representative agent's worst-case expected reward, where worst-case corresponds to the most adverse probability measure among all candidates inducing the unknown true law of the common noise process. We refer to this optimization as a robust mean-field control problem under common noise uncertainty. We first show that this problem arises as the asymptotic limit of a cooperative $N$-agent robust optimization problem, commonly known as propagation of chaos. We then prove the existence of an optimal open-loop control by linking the robust mean field control problem to a lifted robust Markov decision problem on the space of probability measures and by establishing the dynamic programming principle and Bellman--Isaac fixed point theorem for the lifted robust Markov decision problem. Finally, we complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments motivated by distribution planning and systemic risk in finance, highlighting the advantages of accounting for common noise uncertainty.</description>

      <title>On Stochastic Partial Differential Equations and their applications to Derivative Pricing through a conditional Feynman-Kac formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.14870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The price of a financial derivative can be expressed as an iterated conditional expectation, where the inner term conditions on the future of an auxiliary process. We show that this inner conditional expectation solves an SPDE (a 'conditional Feynman-Kac formula'). The problem requires conditioning on a backward filtration generated by the noise of the auxiliary process and enlarged by its terminal value, leading us to search for a backward Brownian motion here. This adds a source of irregularity to the SPDE which we tackle with new techniques. Lastly, we establish a new class of mixed Monte-Carlo PDE numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Filtration Reduction and Completeness in Jump-Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the pricing and hedging of derivatives in frictionless and competitive, but incomplete jump-diffusion markets. A unique equivalent martingale measure (EMM) is obtained using filtration reduction to a fictitious complete market. This unique EMM in the fictitious market is uplifted to the original economy using the notion of consistency. For pedagogical purposes, we begin with simple setups and progressively extend to models of increasing generality.</description>
