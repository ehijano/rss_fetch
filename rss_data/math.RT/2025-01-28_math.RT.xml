      <title>Left-symmetric superalgebras and Lagrangian extensions of Lie superalgebras in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce the notions of left-symmetric and left alternative structures on superspaces in characteristic 2. We describe their main properties and classify them in dimension 2. We show that left-symmetric structures can be queerified if and only if they are left-alternative. Secondly, we present a method of Lagrangian extension of Lie superalgebras in characteristic 2 with a flat torsion-free connection. We show that any strongly polarized quasi-Frobenius Lie superalgebra can be obtained as a Lagrangian extension. Further, we demonstrate that Lagrangian extensions are classified by a certain cohomology space that we introduce. To illustrate our constructions, all Lagrangian extensions in dimension 4 have been described.</description>

      <title>From mutation to $\mathrm{X}$-evolution: flows and foliations on cluster complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cluster complex $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$ of a 2-Calabi-Yau category $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$. For any point $\mathrm{X}$ in $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$, we introduce an $\mathrm{X}$-evolution flow on $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$. We show that such a flow induces a piecewise linear one-dimensional $\mathrm{X}$-foliations with two singularities, the unique sink $\mathrm{X}$ and the unique source $\mathrm{X}[1]$.
  In the case when $\mathcal{C}$ is the cluster category of a Dynkin or Euclidean quiver $Q$, we prove that the $\mathrm{X}$-foliation on $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$ is either compact or semi-compact, for various choices of $\mathrm{X}$. As an application, we show that $\mathrm{Cpx}(\mathcal{C})$ is spherical (Dynkin case) or contractible (Euclidean case). As a byproduct, we show that the fundamental group of the cluster exchange graph of $Q$ is generated by squares and pentagons.</description>

      <title>The highest weight theory for Representations of General Linear groups in the Verlinde categories in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the work of Venkatesh (arXiv:2203.03158), we study further the categories of representations of the general linear groups $GL(X)$ in the Verlinde category $Ver_p$ in characteristic $p$. The main question we answer is how to translate between highest weight labelings for different choices of the Borel subgroup $B(X)\subset GL(X)$. We do this by reducing the general case to the study of representations of the group $GL(X)$ for $X=L_m\oplus L_{n}$ using the method of odd reflections. On the category of representations of $GL(L_m\oplus L_{n})$ we introduce the structure of the highest weight category, as well as the categorical action of $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_p$ through translation functors. It allows us to understand projective and injective objects, BGG reciprocity, duality and lowest weights for simple modules, and standard filtration multiplicities for projective objects.</description>

      <title>The cones of g-vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the wall and chamber structure of algebras via generic decompositions of g-vectors. Specifically, we examine points outside the chambers of the wall and chamber structure of ($\tau$-tilting infinite) finite-dimensional algebras. We demonstrate that the cones of g-vectors are both rational and simplicial. Moreover, we show that the open cone of a given g-vector and its TF-equivalence class coincide if and only if they are of the same dimension. Furthermore, we establish that g-vectors satisfy the ray condition when sufficiently far from the origin. These results allow us to generalize several findings by Iyama and Asai regarding TF-equivalence classes of g-vectors.</description>

      <title>Lusztig varieties for regular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over an algebraically closed field. Let $B$ be a Borel subgroup of $G$ and $W$ be the associated Weyl group. We show that for any $w \in W$ that is not contained in any standard parabolic subgroup of $W$, the intersection of the Bruhat cell $B w B$ with any regular conjugacy class of $G$ is always irreducible. We then prove that the associated Lusztig varieties are irreducible. This extends the previous work of Kim \cite{kim2020homology} on the regular semisimple and regular unipotent elements. The irreducibilitiy result of Lusztig varieties will be used in an upcoming work in the study of affine Lusztig varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using crystal theory we prove the existence of a new family of irreducible components appearing in the tensor product of two irreducible integrable highest weight modules over symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras motivated by the Schur positivity conjecture, Kostant conjecture and Wahl conjecture. We also prove Schur positivity conjecture in full generality when the Lie algebra is a simple Lie algebra under the assumption that $\lambda &gt; &gt; \mu$, i.e. if $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the two dominant weights appearing in the tensor product then $\lambda+w\mu$ is a dominant weight for all the Weyl group elements $w$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy categories and fibrant model structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homotopy category of a model structure on a weakly idempotent complete additive category is proved to be equivalent to the additive quotient of the category of cofibrant-fibrant objects with respect to the subcategory of cofibrant-fibrant-trivial objects. A model structure on pointed category is fibrant, if every object is a fibrant object. Fibrant model structures is explicitly described by trivial cofibrations, and also by fibrations. Fibrantly weak factorization systems are introduced, fibrant model structures are constructed via fibrantly weak factorization systems, and a one-one correspondence between fibrantly weak factorization systems and fibrant model structures is given. Applications are given to rediscover the $\omega$-model structures and the $\mathcal W$-model structures, and their relations with exact model structures are discussed.</description>

      <title>Type AIII orbits in the affine flag variety of type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matsuki and Oshima introduced the notion of clans, which are incomplete matchings between $[1,n]$ with positive or negative signs on isolated vertices. They discovered that clans can parametrise $K$-orbits in the flag varieties for classical linear groups, where $K$ is a fixed point subgroup of an involution in the same classical linear group. Yamamoto gave a full proof for the type AIII $\textsf{GL}_p(\mathbb{C}) \times \textsf{GL}_q(\mathbb{C})$-orbits in type A flag variety. In this work we investigate the affine version of type AIII orbits. For a field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic not equal to two, we construct explicit bijections between the $\textsf{GL}_p(\mathbb{K}(\hspace{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace{-0.5mm})) \times \textsf{GL}_q(\mathbb{K}(\hspace{-0.5mm}(t)\hspace{-0.5mm}))$-orbits in the affine flag variety and certain objects called affine $(p,q)$-clans. These affine $(p,q)$-clans can be concretely interpreted as involutions in the affine permutation group with positive or negative signs in fixed points.</description>

      <title>Brieskorn-Pham singularities via ACM bundles on Geigle-Lenzing projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the singularity category of the Brieskorn-Pham singularity $R=k[X_1, \dots, X_4]/(\sum_{i=1}^{4} X_i^{p_i})$, associated with the Geigle-Lenzing projective space $\mathbb{X}$ of weight quadruple $(p_1,\dots, p_4)$, by investigating the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{ACM}} \, \mathbb{X}$ of arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay bundles on $\mathbb{X}$.
  We introduce the notion of $2$-extension bundles on $\mathbb{X}$, which is a higher dimensional analog of extension bundles on a weighted projective line of Geigle-Lenzing, and then establish a correspondence between $2$-extension bundles and a certain important class of Cohen-Macaulay $R$-modules studied by Herschend-Iyama-Minamoto-Oppermann. Furthermore, we construct a tilting object in $\underline{\mathsf{ACM}} \, \mathbb{X}$ consisting of $2$-extension bundles, whose endomorphism algebra is a $4$-fold tensor product of certain Nakayama algebras. We also investigate the Picard group action on $2$-extension bundles and obtain an explicit formula for the orbit number, which gives a positive answer to a higher version of an open question raised by Kussin-Lenzing-Meltzer.</description>

      <title>Splitting Property of quasitriangular Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the splitting property of quasitriangular Hopf algebras through the lens of twisted tensor products. Specifically, we demonstrate that an infinite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra possesses the splitting property if it admits a factorizable quotient Hopf algebra. We also establish that the splitting property holds if there exists a full rank quotient Hopf algebra where the left and right coinvariants coincide. As a consequence, we obtain a new obstruction for quasitriangular structure in finite-dimensional Hopf algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modified construction of a weighted generalised Grassmannian, which includes all weighted projective spaces as its special case. For a weighted Grassmannian (i.e., for series A) we obtain an explicit parametrisation of possible $\mathbb{Z}$-gradings on Pl\"{u}cker coordinates, and provide the explicit formulae for its dualising sheaf and Hilbert series in terms of this parametrisation. We expect that our approach can be generalised to other irreducible root systems.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero is simple exactly when its derivation algebra is simple. In this paper we characterize those Lie algebras of arbitrary dimension over any field that have a simple derivation algebra. As an application we classify the Lie algebras that have a complete simple derivation algebra and are either finite-dimensional over an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic $p&gt;3$ or $\mathbb{Z}$-graded of finite growth over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associatedcurvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional(infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $%G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c} $. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft'three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashedmanifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that each left Leibniz algebra has a natural structure of a Lie-Yamaguti algebra. In this paper it is shown that every left representation of a left Leibniz algebra $(\mathfrak{g}, \cdot)$ induces naturally a representation of the Lie-Yamaguti algebra $(\mathfrak{g}, [,], [\![ , , ]\!])$ that is associated with $(\mathfrak{g}, \cdot)$. Moreover, it is proved that equivalent representations of $(\mathfrak{g}, \cdot)$ give equivalent representations of $(\mathfrak{g}, [,], [\![ , , ]\!])$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a geometric model for the root category $\mathcal{D}^b(Q)/[2]$ of any Dynkin diagram $Q$, which is an $h_Q$-gon $\mathbf{V}_Q$ with cores, where $h_Q$ is the Coxeter number and $\mathcal{D}^b(Q)$ is the bounded derived category associated to $Q$. As an application, we classify all spaces $\mathrm{ToSt}\mathcal{D}$ of total stability conditions on triangulated categories $\mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ must be of the form $\mathcal{D}^b(Q)$. More precisely, we prove that $\mathrm{ToSt}\mathcal{D}^b(Q)/[2]$ is isomorphic to a suitable moduli space of stable $h_Q$-gons of type $Q$.
  In particular, an $h_Q$-gon $\mathbf{V}$ of type $D_n$ is a (centrally) symmetric doubly punctured $2(n-1)$-gon. $\mathbf{V}$ is stable if it is convex and the punctures are inside the level-$(n-2)$ diagonal-gon. Another interesting case is $E_6$, where the (stable) $h_Q$-gon (dodecagon) can be realized as a pair of planar tiling pattern.</description>

      <title>Fusion-stable structures on triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a fusion category acting on a triangulated category $\mathcal{D}$, in the sense that $\mathcal{D}$ is a $\mathcal{G}$-module category. Our motivation example is fusion-weighted species, which is essentially Heng's construction. We study $\mathcal{G}$-stable tilting, cluster and stability structures on $\mathcal{D}$. In particular, we prove the deformation theorem for $\mathcal{G}$-stable stability conditions.
  A first application is that Duffield-Tumarkin's categorification of cluster exchange graphs of finite Coxeter-Dynkin type can be naturally realized as fusion-stable cluster exchange graphs. Another application is that the universal cover of the hyperplane arrangements of any finite Coxeter-Dynkin type can be realized as the space of fusion-stable stability conditions for certain ADE Dynkin quiver. This provides an alternative uniform proof of $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture in the finite Coxeter-Dynkin case.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the universal centralizer and central D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The group scheme of universal centralizers of a complex reductive group $G$ has a quantization called the spherical nil-DAHA. The category of modules over this ring is equivalent, as a symmetric monoidal category, to the category of bi-Whittaker $D$-modules on $G$. We construct a braided monoidal equivalence, called the Knop-Ng\^o functor, of this category with a full monoidal subcategory of the abelian category of $\mathrm{Ad}(G)$-equivariant $D$-modules, establishing a $D$-module abelian counterpart of an equivalence established by Bezrukavnikov and Deshpande, in a different way.
  As an application of our methods, we prove conjectures of Ben-Zvi and Gunningham by relating this equivalence to parabolic induction and prove a conjecture of Braverman and Kazhdan in the $D$-module setting.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Shuffle formula in science fiction for Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the Macdonald intersection polynomials $\operatorname{I}_{\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}}[X;q,t]$, which are indexed by $k$-tuples of partitions $\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}$. These polynomials are conjectured to be equal to the bigraded Frobenius characteristic of the intersection of Garsia-Haiman modules, as proposed by the science fiction conjecture of Bergeron and Garsia. In this work, we establish the vanishing identity and the shape independence of the Macdonald intersection polynomials. Additionally, we unveil a remarkable connection between $\operatorname{I}_{\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}}$ and the character $\nabla e_{k-1}$ of diagonal coinvariant algebra by employing the plethystic formula for the Macdonald polynomials of Garsia--Haiman--Tesler. Furthermore, we establish a connection between $\operatorname{I}_{\mu^{(1)},\dots,\mu^{(k)}}$ and the shuffle formula $D_{k-1}[X;q,t]$, utilizing novel combinatorial tools such as the column exchange rule, a new fermionic formula for the shuffle formula, and the lightning bolt formula for Macdonald intersection polynomials. Notably, our findings provide a new proof for the shuffle theorem.</description>

      <title>Allison-Benkart-Gao functor and the cyclicity of free alternative functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$. We introduce a pair of adjoint functors, Allison-Benkart-Gao functor $\AG$ and Berman-Moody functor $\BM$, between the category of non-unital alternative algebras over $k$ and the category $\LieR$ of Lie algebras with compatible $sl_3(k)$-actions. Surprisingly, when $A$ is an alternative algebra without a unit, the Allison-Benkart-Gao Lie algebra $\AG(A)$ is not isomorphic to the more well-known Steinberg Lie algebra $st_3(A)$ in general.
  Let $A(D)$ be the free (non-unital) alternative algebra over $D$ generators with the inner derivation algebra $\innAD$. A conjecture on the homology $H_r(\AGAD)$ is proposed. Furthermore, consider the degree $n$ component of $A(D)_n$(resp. $\innAD_n$). The previous conjecture implies another conjecture on the dimensions on $A(D)_n$ and $\text{Inner} A(D)_n$. Some evidences are given to support these conjectures.
  Finally, we prove the cyclicity of the alternative structure, namely that the symmetric group $S_{1+D}$ acts on the multilinear part of $A(D)$, which plays an important role to connect the Lie algebra homology of $\AGAD$ and the character of $A(D)$.</description>

      <title>The geometry of conjugation in affine Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new and precise geometric descriptions of the conjugacy class $[x]$ and coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x') = \{ y \in \overline{W} \mid yxy^{-1} = x' \}$ for all elements $x,x'$ of any affine Coxeter group $\overline{W}$. The centralizer of $x$ in $\overline{W}$ is the special case $\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy class $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = (w-\operatorname{I})R^\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\vee$ is the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then described by ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$, where $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated finite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical move-set ${Mov}(w) = \operatorname{Im}(w - \operatorname{I})$. We prove that the rank of ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and then further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the $\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine exactly when ${Mod}_{\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \cap R^\vee$, in which case our closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as simple as possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main result of this article proves the nonvanishing of cuspidal cohomology for $GL(n)$ over a number field which is Galois over its maximal totally real subfield. The proof uses the internal structure of a strongly-pure weight that can possibly support cuspidal cohomology and the foundational work of Borel, Labesse, and Schwermer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities extend the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials to a broader range of Lie types. In this work, we investigate these multiplicities through the framework of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals. Specifically, for type $C$ with dominant weights and type $B$ with dominant spin weights, we present a combinatorial formula for Lusztig $q$-weight multiplicities in terms of energy functions of Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals, generalizing the charge statistic on semistandard Young tableaux for type $A$. Additionally, we introduce level-restricted $q$-weight multiplicities for nonexceptional types, and prove positivity by providing their combinatorial formulas.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Elements of Prime Power Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjugacy classes and the vanishing elements of a finite group (i.e. elements where some irreducible character of the group vanishes) are among many basic invariants associated to a finite group. These invariants have shown their influence on the structure of groups. In recent years, the effect of combination of both the invariants has been widely studied. In this paper, we study the effect of vanishing elements of prime power order and their conjugacy classes on the structure of a group. We obtain a generalization of some recent results by Dolfi, Pacifici and Sanus (2010), and by Robati (2020).</description>
