      <title>Learning the Language of Protein Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning and \emph{de novo} generation of proteins are pivotal computational biology tasks. Whilst natural language processing (NLP) techniques have proven highly effective for protein sequence modelling, structure modelling presents a complex challenge, primarily due to its continuous and three-dimensional nature. Motivated by this discrepancy, we introduce an approach using a vector-quantized autoencoder that effectively tokenizes protein structures into discrete representations. This method transforms the continuous, complex space of protein structures into a manageable, discrete format with a codebook ranging from 4096 to 64000 tokens, achieving high-fidelity reconstructions with backbone root mean square deviations (RMSD) of approximately 1-5 \AA. To demonstrate the efficacy of our learned representations, we show that a simple GPT model trained on our codebooks can generate novel, diverse, and designable protein structures. Our approach not only provides representations of protein structure, but also mitigates the challenges of disparate modal representations and sets a foundation for seamless, multi-modal integration, enhancing the capabilities of computational methods in protein design.</description>

      <title>Dual network structure of the AV node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems, particularly the brain, are frequently analyzed as networks, conveying mechanistic insights into their function and pathophysiology. This is the first study of a functional network of cardiac tissue. We use calcium imaging to obtain two functional networks in a subsidiary but essential pacemaker of the heart, the atrioventricular node (AVN). The AVN is a small cellular structure with dual functions: a) to delay the pacemaker signal passing from the sinoatrial node (SAN) to the ventricles, and b) to serve as a back-up pacemaker should the primary SAN pacemaker fail. Failure of the AVN can lead to syncope and death. We found that the shortest path lengths and clustering coefficients of the AVN are remarkably similar to those of the brain. The network is ``small-world," thus optimized for energy use vs transmission efficiency. We further study the network properties of AVN tissue with knock-out of the sodium-calcium exchange transporter. In this case, the average shortest path-lengths remained nearly unchanged showing network resilience, while the clustering coefficient was somewhat reduced, similar to schizophrenia in brain networks. When we removed the global action potential using principal component analysis (PCA) in wild-type model, the network lost its ``small-world" characteristics with less information-passing efficiency due to longer shortest path lengths but more robust signal propagation resulting from higher clustering. These two wild-type networks (with and without global action potential) may correspond to fast and slow conduction pathways. Laslty, a one-parameter non-linear preferential attachment model is a good fit to all three AVN networks.</description>

      <title>PatchProt: Hydrophobic patch prediction using protein foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrophobic patches on protein surfaces play important functional roles in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Large hydrophobic surfaces are also involved in the progression of aggregation diseases. Predicting exposed hydrophobic patches from a protein sequence has been shown to be a difficult task. Fine-tuning foundation models allows for adapting a model to the specific nuances of a new task using a much smaller dataset. Additionally, multi-task deep learning offers a promising solution for addressing data gaps, simultaneously outperforming single-task methods. In this study, we harnessed a recently released leading large language model ESM-2. Efficient fine-tuning of ESM-2 was achieved by leveraging a recently developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. This approach enabled comprehensive training of model layers without excessive parameters and without the need to include a computationally expensive multiple sequence analysis. We explored several related tasks, at local (residue) and global (protein) levels, to improve the representation of the model. As a result, our fine-tuned ESM-2 model, PatchProt, cannot only predict hydrophobic patch areas but also outperforms existing methods at predicting primary tasks, including secondary structure and surface accessibility predictions. Importantly, our analysis shows that including related local tasks can improve predictions on more difficult global tasks. This research sets a new standard for sequence-based protein property prediction and highlights the remarkable potential of fine-tuning foundation models enriching the model representation by training over related tasks.</description>

      <title>Spatial modeling algorithms for reactions and transport (SMART) in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological cells rely on precise spatiotemporal coordination of biochemical reactions to control their many functions. Such cell signaling networks have been a common focus for mathematical models, but they remain challenging to simulate, particularly in realistic cell geometries. Herein, we present our software, Spatial Modeling Algorithms for Reactions and Transport (SMART), a package that takes in high-level user specifications about cell signaling networks and molecular transport, and then assembles and solves the associated mathematical and computational systems. SMART uses state-of-the-art finite element analysis, via the FEniCS Project software, to efficiently and accurately resolve cell signaling events over discretized cellular and subcellular geometries. We demonstrate its application to several different biological systems, including YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction, calcium signaling in neurons and cardiomyocytes, and ATP generation in mitochondria. Throughout, we utilize experimentally-derived realistic cellular geometries represented by well-conditioned tetrahedral meshes. These scenarios demonstrate the applicability, flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of SMART across a range of temporal and spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Exploration of methods for computing sensitivities in ODE models at dynamic and steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating parameters of dynamic models from experimental data is a challenging, and often computationally-demanding task. It requires a large number of model simulations and objective function gradient computations, if gradient-based optimization is used. The gradient depends on derivatives of the state variables with respect to parameters, also called state sensitivities, which are expensive to compute. In many cases, steady-state computation is a part of model simulation, either due to steady-state data or an assumption that the system is at steady state at the initial time point. Various methods are available for steady-state and gradient computation. Yet, the most efficient pair of methods (one for steady states, one for gradients) for a particular model is often not clear. Moreover, depending on the model and the available data, some methods may not be applicable or sufficiently robust. In order to facilitate the selection of methods, we explore six method pairs for computing the steady state and sensitivities at steady state using six real-world problems. The method pairs involve numerical integration or Newton's method to compute the steady-state, and -- for both forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis -- numerical integration or a tailored method to compute the sensitivities at steady-state. Our evaluation shows that the two method pairs that combine numerical integration for the steady-state with a tailored method for the sensitivities at steady-state were the most robust, and amongst the most computationally-efficient. We also observed that while Newton's method for steady-state computation yields a substantial speedup compared to numerical integration, it may lead to a large number of simulation failures. Overall, our study provides a concise overview across current methods for computing sensitivities at steady state, guiding modelers to choose the right methods.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>

      <title>Combining Radiomics and Machine Learning Approaches for Objective ASD Diagnosis: Verifying White Matter Associations with ASD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder is a condition characterized by a typical brain development leading to impairments in social skills, communication abilities, repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing. There have been many studies combining brain MRI images with machine learning algorithms to achieve objective diagnosis of autism, but the correlation between white matter and autism has not been fully utilized. To address this gap, we develop a computer-aided diagnostic model focusing on white matter regions in brain MRI by employing radiomics and machine learning methods. This study introduced a MultiUNet model for segmenting white matter, leveraging the UNet architecture and utilizing manually segmented MRI images as the training data. Subsequently, we extracted white matter features using the Pyradiomics toolkit and applied different machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict autism. The prediction sets all exceeded 80% accuracy. Additionally, we employed Convolutional Neural Network to analyze segmented white matter images, achieving a prediction accuracy of 86.84%. Notably, Support Vector Machine demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy at 89.47%. These findings not only underscore the efficacy of the models but also establish a link between white matter abnormalities and autism. Our study contributes to a comprehensive evaluation of various diagnostic models for autism and introduces a computer-aided diagnostic algorithm for early and objective autism diagnosis based on MRI white matter regions.</description>

      <title>ChiSCAT: unsupervised learning of recurrent cellular micro-motion patterns from a chaotic speckle pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that action potentials are accompanied by "intrinsic optical signals", such as a nanometer-scale motion of the cell membrane. Here we present ChiSCAT, a technically simple imaging scheme that detects such signals with interferometric sensitivity. ChiSCAT combines illumination by a {\bf ch}aotic speckle pattern and interferometric scattering microscopy ({\bf iSCAT}) to sensitively detect motion in any point and any direction. The technique features reflective high-NA illumination, common-path suppression of vibrations and a large field of view. This approach maximizes sensitivity to motion, but does not produce a visually interpretable image. We show that unsupervised learning based on matched filtering and motif discovery can recover underlying motion patterns and detect action potentials. We demonstrate these claims in an experiment on blebbistatin-paralyzed cardiomyocytes. ChiSCAT promises to even work in scattering tissue, including a living brain.</description>

      <title>Uncovering multiscale structure in the variability of larval zebrafish navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals chain movements into long-lived motor strategies, exhibiting variability across scales that reflects the interplay between internal states and environmental cues. To reveal structure in such variability, we build Markov models of movement sequences that bridges across time scales and enables a quantitative comparison of behavioral phenotypes among individuals. Applied to larval zebrafish responding to diverse sensory cues, we uncover a hierarchy of long-lived motor strategies, dominated by changes in orientation distinguishing cruising versus wandering strategies. Environmental cues induce preferences along these modes at the population level: while fish cruise in the light, they wander in response to aversive stimuli, or in search for appetitive prey. As our method encodes the behavioral dynamics of each individual fish in the transitions among coarse-grained motor strategies, we use it to uncover a hierarchical structure in the phenotypic variability that reflects exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Across a wide range of sensory cues, a major source of variation among fish is driven by prior and/or immediate exposure to prey that induces exploitation phenotypes. A large degree of variability that is not explained by environmental cues unravels motivational states that override the sensory context to induce contrasting exploration-exploitation phenotypes. Altogether, by extracting the timescales of motor strategies deployed during navigation, our approach exposes structure among individuals and reveals internal states tuned by prior experience.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Sequence and Structure Generation for Realistic Antibody Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibody design plays a pivotal role in advancing therapeutics. Although deep learning has made rapid progress in this field, existing methods jointly generate antibody sequences and structures, limiting task-specific optimization. In response, we propose an antibody sequence-structure decoupling (ASSD) framework, which separates sequence generation and structure prediction. Although our approach is simple, such a decoupling strategy has been overlooked in previous works. We also find that the widely used non-autoregressive generators promote sequences with overly repeating tokens. Such sequences are both out-of-distribution and prone to undesirable developability properties that can trigger harmful immune responses in patients. To resolve this, we introduce a composition-based objective that allows an efficient trade-off between high performance and low token repetition. Our results demonstrate that ASSD consistently outperforms existing antibody design models, while the composition-based objective successfully mitigates token repetition of non-autoregressive models. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/lkny123/ASSD_public}.</description>

      <title>Functional Protein Design with Local Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation (PAAG), a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a nearly sixfold increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 8.7% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model.</description>

      <title>gRNAde: Geometric Deep Learning for 3D RNA inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14749v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational RNA design tasks are often posed as inverse problems, where sequences are designed based on adopting a single desired secondary structure without considering 3D geometry and conformational diversity. We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. Under the hood, gRNAde is a multi-state Graph Neural Network that generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. [2010], gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent RNA polymerase ribozyme structure.

Abstract: Super-resolution microscopy, or nanoscopy, enables the use of fluorescent-based molecular localization tools to study molecular structure at the nanoscale level in the intact cell, bridging the mesoscale gap to classical structural biology methodologies. Analysis of super-resolution data by artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning, offers tremendous potential for discovery of new biology, that, by definition, is not known and lacks ground truth. Herein, we describe the application of weakly supervised paradigms to super-resolution microscopy and its potential to enable the accelerated exploration of the nanoscale architecture of subcellular macromolecules and organelles.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

Abstract: The conventional definition of hypergraph has two major issues: (1) there is not a standard definition of directed hypergraph and (2) there is not a formal definition of nested hypergraph. To resolve these issues, we propose a new definition of hypergraph that unifies the concepts of undirected, directed and nested hypergraphs, and that is uniform in using hyperedge as a single construct for representing high-order correlations among things, i.e., nodes and hyperedges. Specifically, we define a hyperedge to be a simple hyperedge, a nesting hyperedge, or a directed hyperedge. With this new definition, a hypergraph is nested if it has nesting hyperedge(s), and is directed if it has directed hyperedge(s). Otherwise, a hypergraph is a simple hypergraph. The uniformity and power of this new definition, with visualization, should facilitate the use of hypergraph for representing (hierarchical) high-order correlations in general and chemical systems in particular. Graph has been widely used as a mathematical structure for machine learning on molecular structures and 3D molecular geometries. However, graph has a major limitation: it can represent only pairwise correlations between nodes. Hypergraph extends graph with high-order correlations among nodes. This extension is significant or essential for machine learning on chemical systems. For molecules, this is significant as it allows the direct, explicit representation of multicenter bonds and molecular substructures. For chemical reactions, this is essential since most chemical reactions involve multiple participants. We propose the use of chemical hypergraph, a multilevel hypergraph with simple, nesting and directed hyperedges, as a single mathematical structure for representing chemical systems. We apply the new definition of hypergraph to chemical hypergraph and, as simplified versions, molecular hypergraph and chemical reaction hypergraph.</description>

Abstract: A plant growth simulation can be characterized as a reconstructed visual representation of a plant or plant system. The phenotypic characteristics and plant structures are controlled by the scene environment and other contextual attributes. Considering the temporal dependencies and compounding effects of various factors on growth trajectories, we formulate a probabilistic approach to the simulation task by solving a frame synthesis and pattern recognition problem. We introduce a sequence-informed plant growth simulation framework (SI-PGS) that employs a conditional generative model to implicitly learn a distribution of possible plant representations within a dynamic scene from a fusion of low dimensional temporal sensor and context data. Methods such as controlled latent sampling and recurrent output connections are used to improve coherence in the plant structures between frames of predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that SI-PGS is able to capture temporal dependencies and continuously generate realistic frames of plant growth.</description>
