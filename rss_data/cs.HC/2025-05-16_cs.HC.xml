      <title>Trustless Autonomy: Understanding Motivations, Benefits and Governance Dilemma in Self-Sovereign Decentralized AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents) combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts, founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the future agentic web.</description>

      <title>Learn, Explore and Reflect by Chatting: Understanding the Value of an LLM-Based Voting Advice Application Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs), which have become increasingly prominent in European elections, are seen as a successful tool for boosting electorates' political knowledge and engagement. However, VAAs' complex language and rigid presentation constrain their utility to less-sophisticated voters. While previous work enhanced VAAs' click-based interaction with scripted explanations, a conversational chatbot's potential for tailored discussion and deliberate political decision-making remains untapped. Our exploratory mixed-method study investigates how LLM-based chatbots can support voting preparation. We deployed a VAA chatbot to 331 users before Germany's 2024 European Parliament election, gathering insights from surveys, conversation logs, and 10 follow-up interviews. Participants found the VAA chatbot intuitive and informative, citing its simple language and flexible interaction. We further uncovered VAA chatbots' role as a catalyst for reflection and rationalization. Expanding on participants' desire for transparency, we provide design recommendations for building interactive and trustworthy VAA chatbots.</description>

      <title>Visual Feedback of Pattern Separability Improves Myoelectric Decoding Performance of Upper Limb Prostheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.</description>

      <title>WhatsAI: Transforming Meta Ray-Bans into an Extensible Generative AI Platform for Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal generative AI models integrated into wearable devices have shown significant promise in enhancing the accessibility of visual information for blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals, as evidenced by the rapid uptake of Meta Ray-Bans among BVI users. However, the proprietary nature of these platforms hinders disability-led innovation of visual accessibility technologies. For instance, OpenAI showcased the potential of live, multi-modal AI as an accessibility resource in 2024, yet none of the presented applications have reached BVI users, despite the technology being available since then. To promote the democratization of visual access technology development, we introduce WhatsAI, a prototype extensible framework that empowers BVI enthusiasts to leverage Meta Ray-Bans to create personalized wearable visual accessibility technologies. Our system is the first to offer a fully hackable template that integrates with WhatsApp, facilitating robust Accessible Artificial Intelligence Implementations (AAII) that enable blind users to conduct essential visual assistance tasks, such as real-time scene description, object detection, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), utilizing standard machine learning techniques and cutting-edge visual language models. The extensible nature of our framework aspires to cultivate a community-driven approach, led by BVI hackers and innovators to tackle the complex challenges associated with visual accessibility.</description>

      <title>Rhetorical XAI: Explaining AI's Benefits as well as its Use via Rhetorical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores potential benefits of incorporating Rhetorical Design into the design of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.</description>

      <title>Electrodermal Insights into Stress Dynamics of AR-Assisted Safety Warnings in Virtual Roadway Work Zone Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines stress levels in roadway workers utilizing AR-assisted multi-sensory warning systems under varying work intensities. A high-fidelity Virtual Reality environment was used to replicate real-world scenarios, allowing safe exploration of high-risk situations while focusing on the physiological impacts of work conditions. Wearable sensors were used to continuously and non-invasively collect physiological data, including electrodermal activity to monitor stress responses. Analysis of data from 18 participants revealed notable differences in EDR between light- and medium-intensity activities, reflecting variations in autonomic nervous system activity under stress. Also, a feature importance analysis revealed that peak and central tendency metrics of EDR were robust indicators of physiological responses, between light- and medium-intensity activities. The findings emphasize the relationship between AR-enabled warnings, work intensity, and worker stress, offering an approach to active stress monitoring and improved safety practices. By leveraging real-time physiological insights, this methodology has the potential to support better stress management and the development of more effective safety warning systems for roadway work zones. This research also provides valuable guidance for designing interventions to enhance worker safety, productivity, and well-being in high-risk settings.</description>

      <title>Context-AI Tunes: Context-Aware AI-Generated Music for Stress Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music plays a critical role in emotional regulation and stress relief; however, individuals often need different types of music tailored to their unique stress levels or surrounding environment. Choosing the right music can be challenging due to the overwhelming number of options and the time-consuming trial-and-error process. To address this, we propose Context-AI Tune (CAT), a system that generates personalized music based on environmental inputs and the user's self-assessed stress level. A 2x2 within-subject experiment (N=26) was conducted with two independent variables: AI (AI, NoAI) and Environment (Busy Hub, Quiet Library). CAT's effectiveness in reducing stress was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale for Stress (VAS-S). Results show that CAT is more effective than manually chosen music in reducing stress by adapting to user context.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Unintended Consequences in Human-GUI Agent Collaboration for Web Browsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents in web browsing scenarios present complex unintended consequences (UCs). This paper characterizes three UCs from three perspectives: phenomena, influence and mitigation, drawing on social media analysis (N=221 posts) and semi-structured interviews (N=14). Key phenomenon for UCs include agents' deficiencies in comprehending instructions and planning tasks, challenges in executing accurate GUI interactions and adapting to dynamic interfaces, the generation of unreliable or misaligned outputs, and shortcomings in error handling and feedback processing. These phenomena manifest as influences from unanticipated actions and user frustration, to privacy violations and security vulnerabilities, and further to eroded trust and wider ethical concerns. Our analysis also identifies user-initiated mitigation, such as technical adjustments and manual oversight, and provides implications for designing future LLM-based GUI agents that are robust, user-centric, and transparent, fostering a crucial balance between automation and human oversight.</description>

      <title>Post-Post-API Age: Studying Digital Platforms in Scant Data Access Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, data provided by digital platforms has informed substantial research in HCI to understand online human interaction and communication. Following the closure of major social media APIs that previously provided free access to large-scale data (the "post-API age"), emerging data access programs required by the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) have sparked optimism about increased platform transparency and renewed opportunities for comprehensive research on digital platforms, leading to the "post-post-API age." However, it remains unclear whether platforms provide adequate data access in practice. To assess how platforms make data available under the DSA, we conducted a comprehensive survey followed by in-depth interviews with 19 researchers to understand their experiences with data access in this new era. Our findings reveal significant challenges in accessing social media data, with researchers facing multiple barriers including complex API application processes, difficulties obtaining credentials, and limited API usability. These challenges have exacerbated existing institutional, regional, and financial inequities in data access. Based on these insights, we provide actionable recommendations for platforms, researchers, and policymakers to foster more equitable and effective data access, while encouraging broader dialogue within the CSCW community around interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder solutions.</description>

      <title>SnapNCode: An Integrated Development Environment for Programming Physical Objects Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial computing technologies have the potential to revolutionize how we interact with the world around us. However, most modern integrated development environments (IDEs) have not fully adapted to this paradigm shift. For example, physical 3D objects in the real world are still represented as 2D text variables in code, creating a significant perceptual distance between these representations. In response to this challenge, we introduce SnapNCode, a novel IDE for spatial programming. SnapNCode enables programmers to capture various states of physical objects through live video streams from cameras and directly insert these visual representations into their code. Moreover, users can augment physical objects by attaching code snippets onto objects, which are opportunistically triggered when observed by cameras. We conducted a user study (N=12) to assess the usability of SnapNCode. Feedback from participants indicates that the system is easy-to-use and holds promise for daily casual uses and integration into a broader range of workflows.</description>

      <title>CartoAgent: a multimodal large language model-powered multi-agent cartographic framework for map style transfer and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data, it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data, thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in cartography.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of Generative Agent-based Platform for Human-Assistant Interaction Research: A Tale of 10 User Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing and evaluating personalized and proactive assistant agents remains challenging due to the time, cost, and ethical concerns associated with human-in-the-loop experimentation. Existing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) methods often require extensive physical setup and human participation, which introduces privacy concerns and limits scalability. Simulated environments offer a partial solution but are typically constrained by rule-based scenarios and still depend heavily on human input to guide interactions and interpret results. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the possibility of generative agents that can simulate realistic human behavior, reasoning, and social dynamics. However, their effectiveness in modeling human-assistant interactions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present a generative agent-based simulation platform designed to simulate human-assistant interactions. We identify ten prior studies on assistant agents that span different aspects of interaction design and replicate these studies using our simulation platform. Our results show that fully simulated experiments using generative agents can approximate key aspects of human-assistant interactions. Based on these simulations, we are able to replicate the core conclusions of the original studies. Our work provides a scalable and cost-effective approach for studying assistant agent design without requiring live human subjects. We will open source both the platform and collected results from the experiments on our website: https://dash-gidea.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Enhancing performance in bolt torque tightening using a connected torque wrench and augmented reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern production rates and the increasing complexity of mechanical systems require efficient and effective manufacturing and assembly processes. The transition to Industry 4.0, supported by the deployment of innovative tools such as Augmented Reality (AR), equips the industry to tackle future challenges. Among critical processes, the assembly and tightening of bolted joints stand out due to their significant safety and economic implications across various industrial sectors. This study proposes an innovative tightening method designed to enhance the reliability of bolted assembly tightening through the use of Augmented Reality and connected tools. A 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DoF) tracked connected torque wrench assists the operator during tightening, ensuring each screw is tightened to the correct torque. The effectiveness of this method is compared with the conventional tightening method using paper instructions. Participants in the study carried out tightening sequences on two simple parts with multiple screws. The study evaluates the impact of the proposed method on task performance and its acceptability to operators. The tracked connected torque wrench provides considerable assistance to the operators, including wrench control and automatic generation of tightening reports. The results suggest that the AR-based method has the potential to ensure reliable torque tightening of bolted joints.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Quantities of Secondary Data from High-Resolution Synchrotron X-ray Computed Tomography Scans Using AccuStripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of secondary quantitative data extracted from high-resolution synchrotron X-ray computed tomography scans represents a significant challenge for users. While a number of methods have been introduced for processing large three-dimensional images in order to generate secondary data, there are only a few techniques available for simple and intuitive visualization of such data in their entirety. This work employs the AccuStripes visualization technique for that purpose, which enables the visual analysis of secondary data represented by an ensemble of univariate distributions. It supports different schemes for adaptive histogram binnings in combination with several ways of rendering aggregated data and it allows the interactive selection of optimal visual representations depending on the data and the use case. We demonstrate the usability of AccuStripes on a high-resolution synchrotron scan of a particle-reinforced metal matrix composite sample, containing more than 20 million particles. Through AccuStripes, detailed insights are facilitated into distributions of derived particle characteristics of the entire sample. Furthermore, research questions such as how the overall shape of the particles is or how homogeneously they are distributed across the sample can be answered.</description>

      <title>AI LEGO: Scaffolding Cross-Functional Collaboration in Industrial Responsible AI Practices during Early Design Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8 practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more collaborative RAI practices in early design.</description>

      <title>SOS: A Shuffle Order Strategy for Data Augmentation in Industrial Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), obtaining high quality and variance data is still a persistent challenge due to high costs and the inherent variability of real-world activities. This study introduces a generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>ListenNet: A Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network for Auditory Attention Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times. Code is available at:https://github.com/fchest/ListenNet.</description>

      <title>Using Virtual Reality in Museums to Bridge the Gap Between Material Heritage and the Interpretation of Its Immaterial Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material heritage typically has a whole set of associated immaterial heritage, which is essential to pass on to the visitor as a cultural mission of the destinations and those who manage them. In this sense, the interpretation of material heritage is a complex process that is not a fully efficient process with the mere observation of physical artifacts. In this context, it emerges as fundamental to provide visitors with a set of tools that allow them to correctly interpret the artifacts that come to fully understand the cultural dimension of the destinations and their heritage. Accordingly, the role of virtual reality can leverage the creation of innovative and immersive solutions that allow the visitor to understand and feel part of their own heritage and its ancestral component that defines the sociocultural roots of destinations and their civilizational traditions. This article, after dissecting and substantiating the role of virtual reality in the interpretation of heritage, presents a conceptual model, based on the use of virtual reality, which was, in part, prototyped in the scenario of the Portuguese Museum in the city of Miranda do Douro. This proposal is an ongoing contribution to the creation of innovative and immersive tools for the interpretation of heritage.</description>

      <title>Influence of prior and task generated emotions on XAI explanation retention and understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explanation of AI results and how they are received by users is an increasingly active research field. However, there is a surprising lack of knowledge about how social factors such as emotions affect the process of explanation by a decision support system (DSS). While previous research has shown effects of emotions on DSS supported decision-making, it remains unknown in how far emotions affect cognitive processing during an explanation. In this study, we, therefore, investigated the influence of prior emotions and task-related arousal on the retention and understanding of explained feature relevance. To investigate the influence of prior emotions, we induced happiness and fear prior to the decision support interaction. Before emotion induction, user characteristics to assess their risk type were collected via a questionnaire. To identify emotional reactions to the explanations of the relevance of different features, we observed heart rate variability (HRV), facial expressions, and self-reported emotions of the explainee while observing and listening to the explanation and assessed their retention of the features as well as their influence on the outcome of the decision task. Results indicate that (1) task-unrelated prior emotions do not affected the ratantion but may affect the understanding of the relevance of certain features in the sense of an emotion-induced confirmation bias, (2) certain features related to personal attitudes yielded arousal in individual participants, (3) this arousal affected the understanding of these variables.</description>

      <title>Emotion-sensitive Explanation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) research has traditionally focused on rational users, aiming to improve understanding and reduce cognitive biases. However, emotional factors play a critical role in how explanations are perceived and processed. Prior work shows that prior and task-generated emotions can negatively impact the understanding of explanation. Building on these insights, we propose a three-stage model for emotion-sensitive explanation grounding: (1) emotional or epistemic arousal, (2) understanding, and (3) agreement. This model provides a conceptual basis for developing XAI systems that dynamically adapt explanation strategies to users emotional states, ultimately supporting more effective and user-centered decision-making.</description>

      <title>An AI-Powered Research Assistant in the Lab: A Practical Guide for Text Analysis Through Iterative Collaboration with LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing texts such as open-ended responses, headlines, or social media posts is a time- and labor-intensive process highly susceptible to bias. LLMs are promising tools for text analysis, using either a predefined (top-down) or a data-driven (bottom-up) taxonomy, without sacrificing quality. Here we present a step-by-step tutorial to efficiently develop, test, and apply taxonomies for analyzing unstructured data through an iterative and collaborative process between researchers and LLMs. Using personal goals provided by participants as an example, we demonstrate how to write prompts to review datasets and generate a taxonomy of life domains, evaluate and refine the taxonomy through prompt and direct modifications, test the taxonomy and assess intercoder agreements, and apply the taxonomy to categorize an entire dataset with high intercoder reliability. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of using LLMs for text analysis.</description>

      <title>What Makes a Fairness Tool Project Sustainable in Open Source?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As society becomes increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence, the need to mitigate risk and harm is paramount. In response, researchers and practitioners have developed tools to detect and reduce undesired bias, commonly referred to as fairness tools. Many of these tools are publicly available for free use and adaptation. While the growing availability of such tools is promising, little is known about the broader landscape beyond well-known examples like AI Fairness 360 and Fairlearn. Because fairness is an ongoing concern, these tools must be built for long-term sustainability. Using an existing set of fairness tools as a reference, we systematically searched GitHub and identified 50 related projects. We then analyzed various aspects of their repositories to assess community engagement and the extent of ongoing maintenance. Our findings show diverse forms of engagement with these tools, suggesting strong support for open-source development. However, we also found significant variation in how well these tools are maintained. Notably, 53 percent of fairness projects become inactive within the first three years. By examining sustainability in fairness tooling, we aim to promote more stability and growth in this critical area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its U.S. constitutional foundation, the technical ``individual fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in state or federal statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it should ignore race.</description>

      <title>Comparing Exploration-Exploitation Strategies of LLMs and Humans: Insights from Standard Multi-armed Bandit Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&amp;E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&amp;E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&amp;E strategies of the agents and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.</description>

      <title>Empirically evaluating commonsense intelligence in large language models with large-scale human judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.</description>

      <title>AutoCam: Hierarchical Path Planning for an Autonomous Auxiliary Camera in Surgical Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.</description>

      <title>Social Media Should Feel Like Minecraft, Not Instagram: 3D Gamer Youth Visions for Meaningful Social Connections through Fictional Inquiry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate youth visions for ideal remote social interactions, drawing on co-design interviews with 23 participants (aged 15-24) experienced with 3D gaming environments. Using a Fictional Inquiry (FI) method set in the Harry Potter universe, this research reveals that young people desire social media that functions more like immersive, navigable shared social spaces. Across these interviews, participants identified six key priorities for meaningful social connection over social media: intuitive social navigation, shared collaborative experiences, communal environments fostering close relationships, flexible self-presentation, intentional engagement, and playful social mechanics. We introduce the \textit{spatial integrity} framework, a set of four interrelated design principles: spatial presence, spatial composition, spatial configuration, and spatial depth. Together, these principles outline how online spaces can be designed to feel more like meaningful environments, spaces where relationships can grow through shared presence, movement, and intentional interaction. Participants also described the FI process itself as meaningful, not only for generating new ideas but for empowering them to imagine and shape the future of social media.</description>

      <title>Rubikon: Intelligent Tutoring for Rubik's Cube Learning Through AR-enabled Physical Task Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to solve a Rubik's Cube requires the learners to repeatedly practice a skill component, e.g., identifying a misplaced square and putting it back. However, for 3D physical tasks such as this, generating sufficient repeated practice opportunities for learners can be challenging, in part because it is difficult for novices to reconfigure the physical object to specific states. We propose Rubikon, an intelligent tutoring system for learning to solve the Rubik's Cube. Rubikon reduces the necessity for repeated manual configurations of the Rubik's Cube without compromising the tactile experience of handling a physical cube. The foundational design of Rubikon is an AR setup, where learners manipulate a physical cube while seeing an AR-rendered cube on a display. Rubikon automatically generates configurations of the Rubik's Cube to target learners' weaknesses and help them exercise diverse knowledge components. In a between-subjects experiment, we showed that Rubikon learners scored 25% higher on a post-test compared to baselines.</description>

Abstract: The increasing convergence of artificial intelligence has opened new avenues, including its emerging role in enhancing creativity. It is reshaping traditional creative practices such as actor improvisation, which often struggles with predictable patterns, limited interaction, and a lack of engaging stimuli. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, Theatrical Language Processing (TLP), and an AI-driven creativity support tool, Scribble.ai, designed to augment actors' creative expression and spontaneity through interactive practice. We conducted a user study involving tests and interviews with fourteen participants. Our findings indicate that: (1) Actors expanded their creativity when faced with AI-produced irregular scenarios; (2) The AI's unpredictability heightened their problem-solving skills, specifically in interpreting unfamiliar situations; (3) However, AI often generated excessively detailed scripts, which limited interpretive freedom and hindered subtext exploration. Based on these findings, we discuss the new potential in enhancing creative expressions in film and theater studies through an AI-driven tool.</description>

      <title>Towards user-centered interactive medical image segmentation in VR with an assistive AI agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from user feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent that assists users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts in VR. Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale 3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users ("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.</description>

      <title>Beyond Likes: How Normative Feedback Complements Engagement Signals on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many online platforms incorporate engagement signals--such as likes and upvotes--into their content ranking systems and interface design. These signals are designed to boost user engagement. However, they can unintentionally elevate content that is less inclusive and may not support normatively desirable behavior. This issue becomes especially concerning when toxic content correlates strongly with popularity indicators such as likes and upvotes. In this study, we propose structured prosocial feedback as a complementary signal to likes and upvotes--one that highlights content quality based on normative criteria to help address the limitations of conventional engagement signals. We begin by designing and implementing a machine learning feedback system powered by a large language model (LLM), which evaluates user comments based on principles of positive psychology, such as individual well-being, constructive social media use, and character strengths. We then conduct a pre-registered user study to examine how existing peer-based and the new expert-based feedback interact to shape users' selection of comments in a social media setting. Results show that peer feedback increases conformity to popularity cues, while expert feedback shifts preferences toward normatively higher-quality content. Moreover, incorporating expert feedback alongside peer evaluations improves alignment with expert assessments and contributes to a less toxic community environment. This illustrates the added value of normative cues--such as expert scores generated by LLMs using psychological rubrics--and underscores the potential benefits of incorporating such signals into platform feedback systems to foster healthier online environments.</description>

      <title>LLM A*: Human in the Loop Large Language Models Enabled A* Search for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks. Codes and Supplemental Materials can be found at GitHub: https://github.com/speedhawk/LLM-A-.</description>

      <title>Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding misalignments in human task-solving trajectories is critical for improving AI models trained to mimic human reasoning. This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: \textbf{(1) Lack of functions to express intent}, \textbf{(2) Inefficient action sequences}, and \textbf{(3) Incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task}. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three types of misalignments. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect these misalignments in O2ARC trajectories and conduct a hierarchical and quantitative analysis of their impact. Furthermore, we introduce an intention estimation algorithm that predicts missing alignment information between user actions and inferred intentions, leveraging our formalized framework. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the potential of intention learning.</description>

      <title>MapExplorer: New Content Generation from Low-Dimensional Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional visualizations, or "projection maps," are widely used in scientific and creative domains to interpret large-scale and complex datasets. These visualizations not only aid in understanding existing knowledge spaces but also implicitly guide exploration into unknown areas. Although techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP can generate these maps, there exists no systematic method for leveraging them to generate new content. To address this, we introduce MapExplorer, a novel knowledge discovery task that translates coordinates within any projection map into coherent, contextually aligned textual content. This allows users to interactively explore and uncover insights embedded in the maps. To evaluate the performance of MapExplorer methods, we propose Atometric, a fine-grained metric inspired by ROUGE that quantifies logical coherence and alignment between generated and reference text. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the versatility of MapExplorer in generating scientific hypotheses, crafting synthetic personas, and devising strategies for attacking large language models-even with simple baseline methods. By bridging visualization and generation, our work highlights the potential of MapExplorer to enable intuitive human-AI collaboration in large-scale data exploration.</description>

      <title>SensorChat: Answering Qualitative and Quantitative Questions during Long-Term Multimodal Sensor Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing users' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily lives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementation demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 93% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative and open-ended questions.</description>
