      <title>Efimov effect in the Born-Oppenheimer picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Efimov effect in a mass-imbalanced system consisting of two heavy particles and one light particle within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The result obtained in R. Figari, H. Saberbaghi, and A. Teta, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57(5), 2024, for zero angular momentum is recovered here as a special case, and the analysis is extended to all angular momenta. In this setting, the resonant heavy-light interactions are modeled as point interactions, under the assumption of either exchange symmetry or antisymmetry with respect to the positions of the delta centers. Within this framework, we prove that in the unitary limit the Efimov spectrum depends solely on the mass ratio and particle statistics; that is, the so-called three-body parameter is absent. We also provide a condition ensuring that the spectrum contains no nonEfimov eigenvalues. Furthermore, we study the system away from the unitary limit and show that the spatial size of the weakest bound state near the threshold is approximately 2.8 times the two-body scattering length, in contrast to the common assumption that these two scales coincide. Finally, we compute Bargmann bound for the number of bound states and obtain a sharper estimate than the results in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Approach to the Definition of the Path Integral Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We attempt to define a Stochastic Path Integral in Lorentzian time by restricting the relevant domain of integration on $C([0,1],M)$ over a Riemannian configuration manifold (M,g). Through fibration, we define $L^2$-isometric flux spaces in which we consider a stochastic process over which we define a Gaussian measure with respect to which the Path Integral may be rigorously formulated as a functional integral. We prove equivalence to the Euclidean Path Integral theory and the Feynman-Kac theorem.</description>

      <title>Universal TT- and TQ-relations via centrally extended q-Onsager algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A_q$ be the alternating central extension of the q-Onsager algebra, a comodule algebra over the quantum loop algebra of $sl_2$. We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra.</description>

      <title>Reversing Quantum Noise: Quantum Reverse Diffusion for Pauli Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are quantum reverse diffusion stochastic differential equations, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate reverse diffusion dynamics for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. Our results bridge the gap between highly nonlinear classical reverse diffusion, prominent in generative modelling, and linear quantum mechanics. Consequently, this establishes a theoretical framework for diffusion-driven quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Measurement Incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement incompatibility--the impossibility of jointly measuring certain quantum observables--is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing. We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lov\'asz number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lov\'asz number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist.</description>

      <title>Gibbs polystability of Fano manifolds, stability thresholds and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the probabilistic approach for constructing Kahler-Einstein metrics on log Fano manifolds - involving random point processes - to the case of non-discrete automorphism groups, by explicitly breaking the symmetry. This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves and derive a strengthened logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, which implies Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality. In companion papers we will present applications to Onsager's point vortex model on the two-sphere and the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the conformally covariant geodesic metric on simple conformal loop ensemble carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$ there exists a geodesic metric on the carpet of a CLE$_\kappa$ which is canonical in the sense that it is characterized by a certain list of axioms. Our metric can be constructed explicitly as the scaling limit of Minkowski first passage percolation (MFPP), i.e., the metric obtained by taking the infimum of the Lebesgue measure of the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of all paths connecting each pair of points. Earlier work by the first co-author showed that MFPP admits nontrivial subsequential limits. The present paper shows that this subsequential limit is unique and is characterized by our list of axioms. We conjecture that our metric describes the scaling limit of the chemical distance metric for discrete loop models that converge to CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (8/3, 4)$ in the scaling limit, e.g., the critical Ising model for $\kappa=3$. Our argument is inspired by recent works of Gwynne and Miller and Ding and Gwynne on the uniqueness of Liouville quantum gravity metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of identifying a time-dependent source coefficient in a one-dimensional heat equation with a fractional Laplacian subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions and an integral nonlocal data. An a priori estimate is established to ensure the uniqueness and stability of the solution. A fully implicit Crank-Nicolson (CN) finite-difference scheme is proposed and rigorously analysed for stability and convergence. An efficient noise-stable computation algorithm is developed and verified through numerical experiments, demonstrating accuracy and robustness under noisy data.</description>

      <title>On the resolution of categorical symmetries in (Non-) Unitary Rational CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore several aspects of the categorical symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) in two-dimensional Rational Conformal Field Theories (RCFTs) and express it directly in terms of the modular data of the theory. Motivated by the SymTFT construction of arXiv:2409.02806, we provide a general formula for SREE that applies to symmetric (weakly/strongly) and cloaking boundary conditions as well as for fusion rings with multiplicities. We check the formula against several explicit examples. Additionally, we study symmetry resolution for both categorical and invertible symmetries in (non-)diagonal RCFTs and comment on the subtleties that arise in these cases. Finally, we extend our analysis to diagonal non-unitary RCFTs, focusing on theories with generalized Haagerup-Izumi modular data, and find full agreement with the given formula.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate wave scattering by a pair of closely spaced inclusions embedded in a homogeneous medium, characterized by a high contrast physical parameters. The system is modeled by the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation. We show that this configuration exhibits two sub-wavelength resonant modes, whose frequencies display distinct leading-order asymptotic behaviors. These findings differ significantly from those in the three-dimensional Helmholtz setting. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative analysis of the gradient blow-up rates for the wave field localized between the two resonators.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and optimizations for global non-linear hybrid fluid-kinetic finite element stellarator simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive modeling of stellarator plasmas is crucial for advancing nuclear fusion energy, yet it faces unique computational difficulties. One of the main challenges is accurately simulating the dynamics of specific particle species that are not well captured by fluid models, which necessitates the use of hybrid fluid-kinetic models. The non-axisymmetric geometry of stellarators fundamentally couples the toroidal Fourier modes, in contrast to what happens in tokamaks, requiring different numerical and computational treatment.
  This work presents a novel, globally coupled projection scheme inside the JOREK finite element framework. The approach ensures a self-consistent and physically accurate transfer of kinetic markers to the fluid grid, effectively handling the complex 3D mesh by constructing and solving a unified linear system that encompasses all toroidal harmonics simultaneously. To manage the computational complexity of this coupling, the construction of the system's matrix is significantly accelerated using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The efficient localization of millions of particles is made possible by implementing a 3D R-Tree spatial index, which supports this projection and ensures computational tractability at scale.
  On realistic Wendelstein 7-X stellarator geometries, the fidelity of the framework is rigorously shown. In sharp contrast to the uncoupled approaches' poor performance, quantitative convergence tests verify that the coupled scheme attains the theoretically anticipated spectral convergence.
  This study offers a crucial capability for the predictive analysis and optimization of next-generation stellarator designs by developing a validated, high-fidelity computational tool.</description>

      <title>Identifying the $3$-qubit $W$ state with quantum uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $W$ state, a canonical representative of multipartite quantum entanglement, plays a crucial role in quantum information science due to its robust entanglement properties. Quantum uncertainty relations, on the other hand, are a fundamental cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This paper introduces a novel approach to Identifying tripartite $W$ states by leveraging tripartite quantum uncertainty relations. By employing a specific set of non-commuting observables, we formulate an uncertainty-based criterion for identifying $W$ states and rigorously demonstrate its generality in distinguishing them from other tripartite entangled states, such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Our approach bypasses the need for complete quantum state tomography, as it requires only the verification of a set of uncertainty inequalities for efficient $W$-state identification. This work provides a new theoretical tool for identifying multipartite entangled states and underscores the significant role of quantum uncertainty relations in entanglement characterization.</description>

      <title>Local fermion density in inhomogeneous free-fermion chains: a discrete WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Reconstruction of Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an intrinsic information-theoretic approach for recovering Riemannian curvature from the small-time behaviour of heat diffusion. Given a point and a two-plane in the tangent space, we compare the heat mass transported along that plane with its Euclidean counterpart using the relative entropy of finite measures. We show that the leading small-time distortion of this directional entropy encodes precisely the local curvature of the manifold. In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.
  The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces two reduction schemes for Hamiltonian systems on an exact symplectic manifold admitting Lie group symmetries. It is demonstrated that these reduction procedures are equivalent by employing a modified Marsden-Meyer-Weinstein reduction theorem for exact symplectic manifolds and contact manifolds given by energy hypersurfaces. Each approach is illustrated through an example.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to the existence of M{\o}ller maps</title>

Abstract: M{\o}ller maps are identifications between the observables of a perturbatively interacting physical system and the observables of its underlying free (i.e. non-interacting) system. This work studies and characterizes obstructions to the existence of such identifications. The main results are existence and importantly also non-existence theorems, which in particular imply that M{\o}ller maps do not exist for non-Abelian Chern-Simons and Yang-Mills theories on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. These results are obtained through homological algebra techniques which are of independent interest in the analysis of classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Behavior of Typical Pure States from Thermal Equilibrium Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t$ evolving unitarily in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and take for granted that different macro states $\nu$ correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu\subset\mathcal{H}$. Let $P_\nu$ be the projection to $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. It was recently shown that for all Hamiltonians with no highly degenerate eigenvalues and gaps most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}_\mu$ are such that for most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a $t$- and $\psi_0$-independent value $M_{\mu\nu}$ provided that $M_{\mu\nu}$ is not too small. Here, ``most'' refers to the uniform distribution on the sphere $\mathbb{S}(\mathcal{H}_\mu)$. In the present work, we generalize this result from the uniform distribution, corresponding to the micro-canonical ensemble, to the much more general class of Gaussian adjusted projected (GAP) measures. For any density matrix $\rho$ on $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathrm{GAP}(\rho)$ is the most spread out distribution on $\mathbb{S}(\mathcal{H})$ with density matrix $\rho$. We show that also for $\mathrm{GAP}(\rho)$-most $\psi_0\in\mathcal{H}$ for most $t\geq 0$, $\|P_\nu\psi_t\|^2$ is close to a fixed value $M_{\rho P_\nu}$ (which must not be too small). Moreover, we prove a generalization for certain operators $B$ instead of $P_\nu$ and for finite times. Since certain GAP measures are quantum analogs of the (grand-)canonical ensemble, our result expresses a version of equivalence of ensembles.</description>

      <title>$C^\ast$-categorical prefactorization algebras for superselection sectors and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a conceptual and efficient geometric framework to encode the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors of an algebraic quantum field theory on the $n$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. It is shown that, under the typical assumption of Haag duality, the monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of localized superselection sectors carry the structure of a locally constant prefactorization algebra over the category of cone-shaped subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$. Employing techniques from higher algebra, one extracts from this datum an underlying locally constant prefactorization algebra defined on open disks in the cylinder $\mathbb{R}^1\times\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. While the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ arises geometrically as the angular coordinates of cones, the origin of the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ is analytic and rooted in Haag duality. The usual braided (for $n=2$) or symmetric (for $n\geq 3$) monoidal $C^\ast$-categories of superselection sectors are recovered by removing a point of the sphere $\mathbb{R}^1\times(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\setminus\mathrm{pt}) \cong\mathbb{R}^n$ and using the equivalence between $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and locally constant prefactorization algebras defined on open disks in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The non-trivial homotopy groups of spheres induce additional algebraic structures on these $\mathbb{E}_n$-monoidal $C^\ast$-categories, which in the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is given by a braided monoidal self-equivalence arising geometrically as a kind of `holonomy' around the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$. The locally constant prefactorization algebra structures discovered in this work generalize, under some mild geometric conditions, to other discrete spaces and thereby provide a clear link between the geometry of the localization regions and the algebraic structures on the category of superselection sectors.</description>

      <title>Cartan structure equations and Levi-Civita connection in noncommutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.02761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the differential and Riemannian geometry of algebras $A$ endowed with an action of a triangular Hopf algebra $H$ and noncommutativity compatible with the associated braiding. The modules of one forms and of braided derivations are modules in a compact closed category of $H$-equivariant $A$-bimodules, whose internal morphisms correspond to tensor fields. Vector fields and forms approaches to curvature and torsion are proven to be equivalent by extending the Cartan calculus to left (right) $A$-module (not necessarily $A$-bimodule) connections. The Cartan structure equations and the Bianchi identities are derived. Existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection for arbitrary pseudo-Riemannian metrics is proven via a Koszul formula. The general theory includes Drinfeld twists of commutative geometries and also cotriangular Hopf algebras. It is illustrated with the example of the tensor square of Sweedler Hopf algebra which becomes a noncommutative Einstein manifold via a non-central metric.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $P(\Phi)_2$-model on the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. By establishing coming down from infinity for the associated stochastic nonlinear heat equation (SNLH) on the plane, we first construct a $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane as a limit of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measures on large tori. We then study the canonical stochastic quantization of the $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane thus constructed, namely, we study the defocusing stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation forced by an additive space-time white noise (= the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model) on the plane. In particular, by taking a limit of the invariant Gibbs dynamics on large tori constructed by the first two authors with Gubinelli and Koch (2021), we construct invariant Gibbs dynamics for the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane. Our main strategy is to develop further the ideas from a recent work on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model on the three-dimensional torus by the first two authors and Okamoto (2021), and to study convergence of the so-called enhanced Gibbs measures, for which coming down from infinity for the associated SNLH with positive regularity plays a crucial role. By combining wave and heat analysis together with ideas from optimal transport theory, we then conclude global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model on the plane and invariance of the associated Gibbs measure. As a byproduct of our argument, we also obtain invariance of the limiting $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-measure on the plane under the dynamics of the parabolic $\Phi^{k+1}_2$-model.</description>

      <title>Minimal ring extensions of the integers exhibiting Kochen-Specker contextuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13216v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the algebraic study of contextuality in quantum theory. As an algebraic analogue of Kochen and Specker's no-hidden-variables result, we investigate rational subrings over which the partial ring of $d \times d$ symmetric matrices ($d \geq 3$) admits no morphism to a commutative ring, which we view as an "algebraic hidden state." For $d = 3$, the minimal such ring is shown to be $\mathbb{Z}[1/6]$, while for $d \geq 6$ the minimal subring is $\mathbb{Z}$ itself. The proofs rely on the construction of new sets of integer vectors in dimensions 3 and 6 that have no Kochen-Specker coloring.</description>

      <title>Do irrotational water waves remain irrotational in the limit of a vanishing viscosity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical results on water waves almost always start by assuming irrotationality of the flow in order to simplify the formulation. In this work, we investigate the well-foundedness of this hypothesis via numerical simulations of the free-surface Navier-Stokes equations.
  We show that, in the presence of a non-flat bathymetry, either angular or smooth, a gravity wave of finite amplitude can shed vortex pairs from the bottom boundary layer into the bulk of the flow. As these eddies approach the free surface they modify the shape of the wave. It is found that this perturbation does not vanish as the Reynolds number is increased. The vanishing viscosity limit of water waves is therefore singular when no-slip boundary conditions are enforced on the bottom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and infinite-speed propagation of solutions to models arising in porous media, when the mobility is highly degenerate (inverse power law). The approach is based on maximum principles for the fractional Laplacian, and allows to derive lower bounds on solutions in a straightforward manner. Finally, in the case of clogged porous media, where the mobility vanishes at points of unbounded density, solutions that become instantaneously bounded are constructed.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Formalism Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle confined to a straight line, I compile, initially in a concise table, the structural elements of quantum mechanics and contrast them with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences, resulting from the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal structure. The latter was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify their quantifications by the variance and entropic indeterminacy inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and others.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Jaynes-Cummings model with time-dependent coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.</description>

      <title>Existence of transmission eigenvalues for biharmonic scattering by a clamped planar region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the so-called clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. This is a new transmission eigenvalue problem that is derived from the scattering of an impenetrable clamped obstacle in a thin elastic plate. The scattering problem is modeled by a biharmonic wave operator given by the Kirchhoff--Love infinite plate problem in the frequency domain. These scattering problems have not been studied to the extent of other models. Unlike other transmission eigenvalue problems, the problem studied here is a system of homogeneous PDEs defined in all of $\mathbb{R}^2$. This provides unique analytical and computational difficulties when studying the clamped transmission eigenvalue problem. We are able to prove that there exist infinitely many real clamped transmission eigenvalues. This is done by studying the equivalent variational formulation. We also investigate the relationship of the clamped transmission eigenvalues to the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the negative Laplacian for the bounded scattering obstacle.</description>
