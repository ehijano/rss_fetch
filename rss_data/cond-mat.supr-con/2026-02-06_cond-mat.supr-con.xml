      <title>Best practices for a proper evaluation and conversion of physical property equations in superconductors: the examples of WHH formulation, Bean model and other cases of interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there have been growing concerns about the proper evaluation of physical properties of superconductors, in particular for quantities extracted from magnetic characterizations. Errors can and often do occur due to the following issues: i) several measurement instruments still use Gaussian &amp; cgs-emu units instead of the preferable International System (SI) units; ii) there are decades of valuable publications where, however, equations were expressed in Gaussian &amp; cgs-emu or other unit systems or where constants were normalized to unity, which requires proper understanding and unit conversion in order to correctly evaluate the measured physical quantities; iii) the conversion between unit systems sometimes appears challenging and may not be properly performed. In this paper we will describe how to properly convert physical quantities relevant for the evaluation of magnetic and other properties focusing on the still most used unit systems, SI and Gaussian &amp; cgs-emu. We will provide examples of how to properly verify and understand the physical formulae. We will include examples for the correct method to determine the critical current density Jc of a superconductor from the measurement of its magnetic hysteresis loop through the Bean model, and the correct conversion to SI of the equations for Hc2(T) according to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formulation. The goals of this paper are to make the readers aware of the unit conversion issue, to provide useful hands-on tools for proper conversion and to strongly encourage future exclusive use of the SI units and formulae.</description>

      <title>Vertical Nb Josephson junctions fabricated by direct metal deposition on both surfaces of freestanding graphene layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical integration of superconducting electronics requires fabrication strategies that preserve pristine interfaces while accommodating oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors. However, existing van der Waals-based vertical Josephson junctions largely rely on transfer-based assembly schemes that are incompatible with elemental materials such as niobium (Nb). Here, we introduce a freestanding van der Waals membrane architecture that enables deposition-based fabrication of vertical Josephson junctions through double-sided processing of a single suspended two-dimensional layer. Using multilayer graphene suspended across lithographically defined through-holes in a SiNx membrane, we realize vertical Nb/multilayer graphene/Nb Josephson junctions without ambient exposure of buried interfaces. The resulting devices exhibit clear Josephson coupling, including reproducible supercurrents and a temperature dependence of the critical current consistent with short-junction behaviour. Well-defined magnetic interference patterns governed by the membrane-defined aperture geometry, together with sub-gap features that track a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like superconducting gap, further confirm the junction quality. This platform establishes a scalable route to vertical superconducting devices based on oxidation-sensitive elemental superconductors and van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Ferron-Polaritons in Superconductor/Ferroelectric/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the formation of ferron-polariton - a hybrid light-matter quasiparticle arising from the coupling between collective ferroelectric excitations (ferrons) and Swihart photons in a superconductor/ferroelectric/superconductor heterostructure. The coupling provides direct evidence for ferrons and reaches the ultrastrong-coupling regime, with a spectral gap in the terahertz range, orders of magnitude larger than those in magnetic analogues, reflecting the superior strength of electric dipole interactions. Our work establishes superconductor-ferroelectric heterostructures as a novel platform for exploring extreme light-matter coupling and for developing high-speed, ferroelectric-based quantum technologies at terahertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Topological Superconductivity and Electrically Tunable Majorana Corner Modes in Monolayer MnXPb$_2$ (X=Se, Te)-Pb Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductors host Majorana zero modes localized at corners or hinges, providing a promising route toward scalable and controllable Majorana networks without vortices or magnetic flux. Here we propose a symmetry-enforced higher-order topological superconductivity based on antiferromagnetic topological insulators, specifically realized in MnXPb$_2$ (X = Se, Te)-Pb heterostructure. We show that the intrinsic boundary dichotomy-gapless Dirac states protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry on antiferromagnetic edges and magnetic gaps on ferromagnetic edges-naturally generates Majorana corner modes as mass domain walls. Superconducting proximity converts the antiferromagnetic edges into one-dimensional topological superconductors, and the intersections between superconducting and magnetic edges bind Majorana zero modes as mass domain walls. Combining first-principles calculations with a calibrated effective boundary theory, we demonstrate robust corner localization and purely electrical control of Majorana fusion and braiding in a triangular geometry. Our results establish MnXPb$_2$ as experimentally promising platform for electrically programmable Majorana networks in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Raman response of collective modes in multicomponent superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a microscopic theory of the Raman response of superconducting collective modes in multicomponent superconductors. Starting from a general Bogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian with a separable pairing interaction, we derive a gauge-invariant expression for the Raman susceptibility, including a long-range Coulomb interaction. The resulting Raman susceptibility is directly computable for an arbitrary BdG Hamiltonian, which contains single- and multiband systems, spin-singlet and triplet order parameters, and time-reversal-symmetric and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting states. Based on the microscopic coupling between a Raman source field and collective modes, we derive a symmetry selection rule for Raman-active collective modes and show a group-theoretical classification for all crystalline point groups. This classification provides a unified framework based on the ``higher-order Lifshitz-invariant'' to identify Raman-active collective modes such as Leggett mode, Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode, and clapping mode. As an application, we focus on an effective model of the heavy-fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ with a fully gapped multicomponent odd-parity pairing state. We find sharp in-gap Raman resonances below the quasiparticle continuum, which do not correspond to a conventional Leggett mode but arise from the {\it intraband} relative modes between different pairing components.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure and Superconducting Gap of HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ Revealed by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatially-resolved laser-based high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have been performed on the optimally-doped HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) superconductor with a $T_c$ at 133 K. Two distinct regions are identified on the cleaved surface: the single Fermi surface region where only one Fermi surface is observed, and the double Fermi surface region where two Fermi surface sheets are resolved coming from both the inner (IP) and outer (OP) CuO$_2$ planes. The electronic structure and superconducting gap are measured on both of these two regions. In both cases, the observed electronic states are mainly concentrated near the nodal region. The momentum dependence of superconducting gap deviates from the standard d-wave form. These results indicate that the surface electronic structure of Hg1223 behaves more like that of underdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Fit-Free Optical Determination of Electronic Thermalization Time in Nematic Iron-Based Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nematic response function model (NRFM) for fit-free direct extraction of the characteristic time of ultrafast electronic thermalization in iron-based superconductors, materials with electronic nematicity. By combining the NRFM for polarization-dependent pump--probe measurements of electronic nematic response with the two-temperature model (TTM) for sub-picosecond quasiparticle relaxation, we quantify the electronic thermalization timescales and their anisotropy. The nematic response function is modeled as the difference of normalized reflectivity signals, revealing a pronounced sub-picosecond extremum in signal evolution that directly yields the characteristic electronic thermalization time. This method demonstrates that the NRFM is consistent with TTM fits of transient optical response, yielding electronic thermalization time constants on the order of 110--230~fs for the FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ and Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ thin films. The proposed approach can be applied to any material that exhibits electronic nematicity, providing a powerful tool for direct mapping of the relaxation time in nematic materials, avoiding complex experimental data-fitting procedures.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the emergence of quantum jumps in a monitored qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum jumps, the collapse of a quantum system upon measurement, are among the most striking consequences of observation in quantum mechanics. While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate pair-density-wave correlations in two-leg ladder $t$--$J$--$J_\perp$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Evidence of Competing Diagonal Spin Interactions and Spin Disproportionation in the Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive spectroscopic map of the electronic, magnetic, and lattice excitations is presented for the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using Raman scattering at ambient pressure. Upon entering the spin density wave state below 153 K, the $A_{1g}$ channel exhibits an abrupt electronic spectral gap with a clear isosbestic point. In contrast, the $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels are dominated by pronounced two-magnon (2M) excitations, representing an unambiguous signature of incipient Mottness. These 2M signals in both channels constitute direct evidence for two distinct in-plane spin exchange interactions along the Ni-O bonding and its diagonal directions. Calculations based on the spin wave theory further reveal that the 2M mode in the $B_{2g}$ channel arises from the competition between two bond-diagonal antiferromagnetic interactions mediated by nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Furthermore, emergent low-energy 2M excitations below 10 meV are found to originate from distinct, weaker spin moments, strongly supporting spin disproportionation. Simultaneously, an anomalous softening of $B_{1g}$ phonons from 280 down to 4.5 K is uncovered, suggesting the presence of an incipient lattice instability leading to checkerboard-type breathing modulations. Collectively, these findings identify a ground state of the bilayer nickelate characterized by competing bond-diagonal interactions, spin disproportionation, and an incipient lattice instability, establishing key ingredients for understanding the mechanism of nickelate superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Grain boundaries are critical for determining the functionality of polycrystalline materials. Here we present on the structural $\&amp;$ transport properties of grain boundaries in the unconventional superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We provide a detailed recipe for the fabrication of isolated grain boundary devices from of as-grown polycrystalline samples of CeCoIn$_5$. Electron backscattered diffraction imaging of polycrystalline CeCoIn$_5$ samples reveals an abundance of $90^\circ$ misorientation grain boundaries suggesting a preferential nucleation of CeCoIn$_5$ grains with 90$^\circ$ misorientation over a random distribution of grain orientations. Transport measurements across grain boundary devices establish coherence of superconductivity and allows us to establish a lower bound on the critical current density for the grain boundaries. Our work opens new possibilities for fabrication of quantum devices such as Josephson-junctions out of bulk unconventional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Dome in Ionic Liquid Gated Homoepitaxial Strontium Titanate Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we patterned a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the surface of a SrTiO$_3$ thin film grown homoepitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). We explored the superconducting dome in this material system by tuning electron density with ionic liquid gating. We found superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of approximately 3 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$ single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature, coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilization and effect of A-site ionic size in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has sparked a surge of research into Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates. Currently, stabilizing the bilayer RP phases with smaller $A$-site ions remains a significant challenge. In this work, we have successfully synthesized medium- and high-entropy bilayer nickelates, La$_{1.2}$Pr$_{0.6}$Nd$_{0.6}$Sm$_{0.6}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ and La$_{0.67}$Pr$_{0.67}$Nd$_{0.67}$Sm$_{0.33}$Eu$_{0.33}$Gd$_{0.33}$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$, by utilizing the concept of configuration entropy stabilization. The high-entropy nickelate exhibits the smallest unit-cell volume and the largest orthorhombic distortion reported to date. The chemical pressure induced by the smaller A-site ions significantly enhances the NiO$_6$ octahedral rotation/distortion and shortens the interlayer Ni-Ni interatomic spacing. Physical property measurements reveal bad electrical conductivity alongside a markedly elevated density-wave transition temperature. Notably, the superconducting transition temperature extrapolated from structural correlations is projected to exceed 100 K. Our work not only demonstrates entropy stabilization of bilayer nickelates, but also reveals the effect of $A$-site-ion size on the crystal structure and physical properties, opening a new pathway for developing nickelate superconductors and tuning their electronic properties.</description>

Abstract: The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them interesting for both technological applications and fundamental research. Unlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution, $e^{i\theta}$, where $\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often neglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin can differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors, the Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising from a vortex encircling a $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this fractional charge, and hence the topological spin, can be manipulated through the control of device geometry, introducing an additional control knob for topological quantum computing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment that reveals the presence of this fractional charge through shifts in the critical current.</description>
