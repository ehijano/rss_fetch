      <title>Non-Abelian braiding of Fibonacci anyons with a superconducting processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological orders offer an intriguing path towards fault-tolerant quantum computation, where information can be encoded and manipulated in a topologically protected manner immune to arbitrary local noises and perturbations. However, realizing non-Abelian topologically ordered states is notoriously challenging in both condensed matter and programmable quantum systems, and it was not until recently that signatures of non-Abelian statistics were observed through digital quantum simulation approaches. Despite these exciting progresses, none of them has demonstrated the appropriate type of topological orders and associated non-Abelian anyons whose braidings alone support universal quantum computation. Here, we report the realization of non-Abelian topologically ordered states of the Fibonacci string-net model and demonstrate braidings of Fibonacci anyons featuring universal computational power, with a superconducting quantum processor. We exploit efficient quantum circuits to prepare the desired states and verify their nontrivial topological nature by measuring the topological entanglement entropy. In addition, we create two pairs of Fibonacci anyons and demonstrate their fusion rule and non-Abelian braiding statistics by applying unitary gates on the underlying physical qubits. Our results establish a versatile digital approach to exploring exotic non-Abelian topological states and their associated braiding statistics with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentanglement Ain't Cheap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any pseudoentangled state ensemble with a gap of $t$ bits of entropy requires $\Omega(t)$ non-Clifford gates to prepare. This bound is tight up to polylogarithmic factors if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist. Our result follows from a polynomial-time algorithm to estimate the entanglement entropy of a quantum state across any cut of qubits. When run on an $n$-qubit state that is stabilized by at least $2^{n-t}$ Pauli operators, our algorithm produces an estimate that is within an additive factor of $\frac{t}{2}$ bits of the true entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Loss resilience of driven-dissipative remote entanglement in chiral waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing limits of entanglement in open quantum systems is a problem of fundamental interest, with strong implications for applications in quantum information science. Here, we study limits of entanglement stabilization between remote qubits. We theoretically investigate the loss resilience of driven-dissipative entanglement between remote qubits coupled to a chiral waveguide. We find that by coupling a pair of storage qubits to the two driven qubits, the steady state can be tailored such that the storage qubits show a degree of entanglement that is higher than what can be achieved with only two driven qubits coupled to the waveguide. By reducing the degree of entanglement of the driven qubits, we show that the entanglement between the storage qubits becomes more resilient to waveguide loss. Our analytical and numerical results offer insights into how waveguide loss limits the degree of entanglement in this driven-dissipative system, and offers important guidance for remote entanglement stabilization in the laboratory, for example using superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transition Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition probabilities are an important and useful tool in quantum mechanics. However, in their present form, they are limited in scope and only apply to pure quantum states. In this article we extend their applicability to mixed states and to transitions between quantum effects. We also present their dependence on a measured operation or instrument. We begin by defining our concepts on a general quantum effect algebra. These concepts are illustrated using Holevo operations and instruments. We then present transition probabilities in the special case of the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. We show that for pure states and particular types of operations the transition probabilities reduce to their usual form. We give examples in terms of L\"uders operations and instruments.</description>

      <title>Extending the self-discharge time of Dicke quantum batteries using molecular triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, quantum systems for energy storage, have gained interest due to their potential scalable charging power density. A quantum battery proposal based on the Dicke model has been explored using organic microcavities, which enable a cavity-enhanced energy transfer process called superabsorption. However, energy storage lifetime in these devices is limited by fast radiative emission losses, worsened by superradiance. Here, we demonstrate a promising approach to extend the energy storage lifetime of Dicke quantum batteries using molecular triplet states. We examine a type of multi-layer microcavities where an active absorption layer transfers energy to the molecular triplets of a storage layer, identifying two regimes based on exciton-polariton resonances. We tested one of these mechanisms by fabricating and characterising five devices across a triplet-polariton resonance. We conclude by discussing potential optimisation outlooks for this class of devices.</description>

      <title>Reaction dynamics with qubit-efficient momentum-space mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers, which are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We consider a qubit-efficient mapping on a lattice, which can be efficiently performed using momentum-space basis states. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, focusing on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We investigate ground-state preparation, controlled time evolution and the required measurements. We examine circuit depth and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</description>

      <title>Imaging a Chain of Rydberg Superatoms Enabled by F\"{o}rster-Resonance-Enhanced Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate single-shot and \textit{in situ} absorption imaging of individual Rydberg superatoms. This level of resolution is achieved using an electromagnetically induced transparency scheme involving a Rydberg energy level that is highly sensitive to the presence of Rydberg superatoms due to F\"{o}rster-resonance-enhanced dipole couplings. Spectroscopic measurements illustrate the existence of the F\"{o}rster resonance and underscore the state-selectivity of the technique. With an imaging exposure time as short as 3 $\mu$s, we successfully resolve linear chains of Rydberg superatoms excited in a one-dimensional configuration. The extracted second-order correlation shows strong anti-bunching due to excitation blockade, and a Fourier analysis reveals the long-range order in the chains of Rydberg superatoms. This imaging technique, with minimal destruction, will be of great interest for leveraging ensemble-encoded qubits in quantum computation and quantum simulation applications.</description>

      <title>Twisted charged particles in the uniform magnetic field with broken symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical description of charged particles with nonzero projection of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) in a uniform magnetic field with broken symmetry of the vector potential. The wave functions we find naturally account for the asymmetry through the continuous gauge parameter and are a generalization of the commonly used Laguerre-Gauss states. We analyze the asymmetric Hamiltonian from an algebraic point of view and show how the OAM projection of the twisted state is modified by symmetry breaking. We provide analytical frameworks for properties of the asymmetric states, such as energy, RMS size, and Cazimir invariant, and discuss advantages of the proposed description.</description>

      <title>Saturation effect in confined quantum systems with energy-dependent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the saturation effect in the energy or mass spectra of three quantum models with energy-dependent potentials: the harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, and the heavy quarkonia. We used the method proposed in \cite{garcia2009exactly}, which is based on studying various canonical point and gauge transformations applied to a function, $g(x)$, multiplied by a given differential equation of known solutions as special orthogonal functions, that convert it into a Schr{{\"o}}dinger-like equation. The first two models stem from implementing the method on the confluent hypergeometric differential of the well-known solutions ${}_1 F_1$, while the third model (heavy quarkonia) stems possibly from the hypergeometric differential of the well-known solutions ${}_2 F_1$. In particular, the heavy quarkonia mass spectra for both $c\bar c$ and $b\bar b$ are produced at different values of the saturation parameter $\lambda$ and compared with the available experimental data. It is found that these systems may exhibit saturation effect when the energy-dependent effect is included.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Swapping Using Hyperentangled Pairs of Two-Level Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperentangled swapping is a quantum communication technique that involves the exchange of hyperentangled states, which are quantum states entangled in multiple degrees of freedom, to enable secure and efficient quantum information transfer. In this paper, we demonstrate schematics for the hyperentanglement swapping between separate pairs of neutral atoms through the mathematical framework of atomic Bragg diffraction, which is efficient and resistant to decoherence, yielding deterministic results with superior overall fidelity. The utilized cavities are in superposition state and interact with the incoming atoms off-resonantly. Quantum information carried by the cavities is swapped through resonant interactions with two-level auxiliary atoms. We also discuss entanglement swapping under a delayed-choice scenario and provide a schematic generalization covering multiple-qubit scenarios. Finally, we introduce specific experimental parameters to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Maximal quantum interaction between free electrons and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>

      <title>Stochastic correction to the Maxwell-Bloch equations via the positive P-representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on two-level atoms, we apply the positive P-representation to a full-wave mixed bosonic and fermionic system of Jaynes-Cummings type and identify an advantageous degree of freedom in the choice of the involved nonorthogonal fermionic basis states. On this basis, we propose a stochastic correction to the Maxwell-Bloch equations by relating them to a stochastic differential equation on a nonclassical phase space, which captures the full second quantization dynamics of the system. This approach explores the connection between semiclassical and field-quantized treatments of light-matter interaction and can potentially be used for the simulation of nonclassical light sources while retaining the main advantages of a semiclassical model.</description>

Abstract: We prove sharp universal upper bounds on the number of steady and asymptotic states of discrete- and continuous-time Markovian evolutions of open quantum systems. We show that the bounds depend only on the dimension of the system and not on the details of the dynamics. A comparison with similar bounds deriving from a recent spectral conjecture for Markovian evolutions is also provided.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally how the diffraction and interferometric resolution limit for single-mode coherent cw laser light can be overcome by multi-photon interference. By use of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, operated in the single input and single or double output port geometries, we observe a fringe width reduction of the conventional interference pattern, predicted by the wave or single photon quantum theory, by a factor of up to $1/\sqrt{2N}$ through coincident detection of $N=2,3,4$ photons. Our scheme does not require squeezed or entangled light to overcome the standard quantum limit and greatly facilitates precision interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Teleportation two-qubit state by using two different protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, two versions of teleportation protocol are considered, based on either using a single or two copies of entangled atom-field state, respectively. It is shown that, by using the first version, the fidelity of the teleported state as well as the amount of quantum Fisher information, that contains in the teleported state, are much better than using the second version. In general, one may increases the fidelity of teleported information by increasing the mean photon number and decreasing the detuning parameter. The fidelity of teleporting classical information is much better than teleporting quantum information. Moreover, teleportating classical information that initially encoded in an exited states is much better than that encodes in the ground states. However, the teleported Fisher information that initially encoded in a ground state is much larger than those initially encoded in entangled states.</description>

      <title>Achieving quantum advantage in a search for a minimal Goldbach partition with driven atoms in tailored potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Goldbach conjecture states that any even natural number $N$ greater than $2$ can be written as the sum of two prime numbers $p$ and $p'$, with $p \, , p'$ referred to as a Goldbach pair. In this article we present a quantum analogue protocol for detecting -- given a even number $N$ -- the existence of a so-called minimal Goldbach partition $N=p+p'$ with $p\equiv p_{\rm min}(N)$ being the so-called minimal Goldbach prime, i.e. the least possible value for $p$ among all the Goldbach pairs of $N$. The proposed protocol is effectively a quantum Grover algorithm with a modified final stage. Assuming that an approximate smooth upper bound $\mathcal{N}(N)$ for the number of primes less than or equal to $ p_{\rm min}(N)$ is known, our protocol will identify if the set of $\mathcal{N}(N)$ lowest primes contains the minimal Goldbach prime in approximately $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N)}$ steps, against the corresponding classical value $\mathcal{N}(N)$. In the larger context of a search for violations of Goldbach's conjecture, the quantum advantage provided by our scheme appears to be potentially convenient. E.g., referring to the current state-of-art numerical search for violations of the Goldbach conjecture among all even numbers up to $N_{\text{max}} = 4\times 10^{18}$ [T. O. e Silva, S. Herzog, and S. Pardi, Mathematics of Computation 83, 2033 (2013)], a quantum realization of the search would deliver a quantum advantage factor of $\sqrt{\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}})} \approx 37$ and it will require a Hilbert space spanning $\mathcal{N}(N_{\text{max}}) \approx 1376$ basis states.</description>

      <title>Enhancing interferometry using weak value amplification with real weak values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an ultra-sensitive interferometric protocol that combines weak value amplification (WVA) with traditional interferometry. This WVA+interferometry protocol uses weak value amplification of the relative delay between two paths to enhance the interferometric sensitivity, approaching the quantum limit for classical light. As an example, we demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment that achieves few-attosecond timing resolution (few-nanometer path length resolution) with a double-slit interferometer using only common optical components. Since our example uses only the spatial shift of double-slit interference fringes, its precision is not limited by the timing resolution of the detectors, but is instead limited solely by the fundamental shot noise associated with classical light. We experimentally demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by one to three orders of magnitude and approaches the shot-noise limit in the large amplification regime. Previously, quantum-limited WVA delay measurements were thought to require imaginary weak values, which necessitate light with a broad spectral bandwidth and high-resolution spectrometers. In contrast, our protocol highlights the feasibility of using real weak values and narrowband light. Thus, our protocol is a compelling and cost-effective approach to enhance interferometry.</description>

      <title>Quantum Heat Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum heat transformer (QHT) designed to function analogous to classical voltage transformers. Unlike the classical counterparts, which regulate voltage, a QHT regulates temperature differences between its terminals. We initially design the device for a three-qubit system, representing the smallest possible self-contained heat transformer model. Subsequently we extend to four-qubit systems, with a specific emphasis on exploring the step-down mode for identifying the primary figure of merit. We showcase the versatility and adaptability of the models by demonstrating the availability of various self-contained setups. A key performance indicator, the capacity of thermal control, is defined to measure the capability of QHTs. An important effect in this study is the proof of existence of a necessarily transient step-down quantum heat transformer, that has a dual-mode characteristic, wherein the desired step-down mode can be realized within the transient regime of an originally designed step-up mode of the QHT. We also investigate how to control this transient domain up to which the necessarily transient mode can be achieved, by regulating the initial temperature of the qubits in the four-qubit settings. Therefore, this quantum heat transformer model not only acts as an analog to the classical voltage transformer, but also enjoys advanced characteristics, enabling it to function in both step-up and step-down modes within the same setup, unattainable for voltage transformers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, I investigate various aspects of one of the most fundamental questions in thermodynamics: what state transformations can quantum systems undergo while interacting with a thermal bath under specific constraints? These constraints may involve total energy conservation, memory effects, or finite-size considerations. Addressing this question leads to (i) a characterisation of the structure of the thermodynamic arrow of time, (ii) a framework bridging the gap between memoryless and arbitrarily non-Markovian thermodynamic processes, and (iii) a derivation of the famous fluctuation-dissipation relation within a quantum information framework. Finally, the last part of this thesis focuses on studying a ubiquitous phenomenon in science, so-called catalysis. It involves using an auxiliary system (a catalyst) to enable processes that would otherwise be impossible. Over the last two decades, this notion has spread to the field of quantum physics. However, this effect is typically described within a highly abstract framework. Despite its successes, this approach struggles to fully capture the behaviour of physically realisable systems, thereby limiting the applicability of quantum catalysis in practical scenarios. Strikingly, I will demonstrate this effect in a paradigmatic quantum optics setup, namely the Jaynes-Cummings model, where an atom interacts with an optical cavity. The atom plays the role of the catalyst and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity, as evidenced by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a new perspective and method for the development and application of science. Imaginary numbers are used to describe and solve many complex problems. Therefore imaginarity resource theory proposed recently has become increasingly important and it is worthy of research. In this paper, we find two imaginarity measures, one of which is induced by $\alpha$--$z$--R\'enyi relative entropy and the other defined for positive definite density matrices is induced by Tsallis relative operator entropy. The relationships between different imaginarity measures and their properties are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics, exhibiting remarkable experimental tunability, rich magnonic nonlinearities, and compatibility with various quantum systems, has witnessed considerable advances in recent years. However, the potential benefits of using cavity magnomechanical (CMM) systems in further improving the performance of quantum-enhanced sensing for weak forces remain largely unexplored. Here we show that the performance of a quantum CMM sensor can be significantly enhanced beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL), by squeezing the magnons. We find that, for comparable parameters, two orders of enhancement in force sensitivity can be achieved in comparison with the case without the magnon squeezing. Moreover, we show optimal parameter regimes of homodyne angle for minimizing added quantum noise. Our findings provide a promising approach for highly tunable and compatible quantum force sensing using hybrid CMM devices, with potential applications ranging from quantum precision measurements to quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent dynamics of interacting quantum particles plays a central role in the study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the pursuit of quantum information processors. Here, we present the state-space of interacting Rydberg atoms as a synthetic landscape on which to control and observe coherent and correlated dynamics. With full control of the coupling strengths and energy offsets between the pairs of sites in a nine-site synthetic lattice, we realize quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and dynamics in an Escher-type ``continuous staircase". In the interacting regime, we observe correlated quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and confinement of particle pairs. Additionally, we simultaneously tilt our lattice both up and down to achieve coherent pair oscillations. This work establishes synthetic Rydberg lattices of interacting atom arrays as a promising platform for programmable quantum many-body dynamics with access to features that are difficult to realize in real-space lattices.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds for device-independent quantum key distribution with local Bell test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main challenges in device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is achieving the required Bell violation over long distances, as the channel losses result in low overall detection efficiencies. Recent works have explored the concept of certifying nonlocal correlations over extended distances through the use of a local Bell test. Here, an additional quantum device is placed in close proximity to one party, using short-distance correlations to verify nonlocal behavior at long distances. However, existing works have either not resolved the question of DIQKD security against active attackers in this setup, or used methods that do not yield tight bounds on the keyrates. In this work, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate computation task in this setup that can be combined with recently developed methods for analyzing standard DIQKD. Using this method, we show that if the short-distance devices exhibit sufficiently high detection efficiencies, positive key rates can be achieved in the long-distance branch with lower detection efficiencies as compared to standard DIQKD setups. This highlights the potential for improved performance of DIQKD over extended distances in scenarios where short-distance correlations are leveraged to validate quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a promising approach for solving the real-time dynamics of systems consist of quarks and gluons from first-principle calculations that are intractable with classical computers. In this work, we start with an initial problem of the ultra-relativistic quark-nucleus scattering and present an efficient and precise approach to quantum simulate the dynamics on the light front. This approach employs the eigenbasis of the asymptotic scattering system and implements the compact scheme for basis encoding. It exploits the operator structure of the light-front Hamiltonian of the scattering system, which enables the Hamiltonian input scheme that utilizes the quantum Fourier transform for efficiency. It utilizes the truncated Taylor series for the dynamics simulations. The qubit cost of our approach scales logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension of the scattering system. The gate cost has optimal scaling with the simulation error and near optimal scaling with the simulation time. These scalings make our approach advantageous for large-scale dynamics simulations on future fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate our approach with a simple scattering problem and benchmark the results with those from the Trotter algorithm and the classical calculations, where good agreement between the results is found.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology of Absorption and Gain Parameters using Two-Mode Bright Squeezed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption and gain processes are fundamental to any light-matter interaction and a precise measurement of these parameters is important for various scientific and technological applications. Quantum probes, specifically the squeezed states have proved very successful, particularly in the applications that deal with phase shift and force measurements. In this paper, we focus on improving the sensitivity of the estimation of the photon loss coefficient of a weakly absorbing medium as well as the estimation of the gain parameter using a two-mode bright squeezed state. The generation of this state combines the advantage of a coherent beam for its large photon number with the quantum properties of the two-mode squeezing operation in an optical parametric amplifier. We present two measurement schemes: balanced photodetection and time-reversed metrology, both utilizing two-mode bright squeezed light. The maximum quantum advantage we can achieve using two-mode bright squeezed light is 3.7 times for the absorption parameter $\alpha = 0.05$ and 8.4 times for $\alpha = 0.01$ as compared to using only the coherent state. Similarly, the maximum quantum advantage for the estimation of optical gain is found around 2.81 times for the gain coefficient $G=1.05$ and around 6.28 times for $G=1.01$. We discuss the significance of using one measurement scheme over the other under different squeezing conditions. We compare our results with the Cram\'er-Rao bound for a two-mode bright squeezed state to assess the quality of the proposed methodologies.</description>

      <title>Two prover perfect zero knowledge for MIP*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent MIP*=RE theorem of Ji, Natarajan, Vidick, Wright, and Yuen shows that the complexity class MIP* of multiprover proof systems with entangled provers contains all recursively enumerable languages. Prior work of Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen [FOCS '19] further shows (via a technique called simulatable codes) that every language in MIP* has a perfect zero knowledge (PZK) MIP* protocol. The MIP*=RE theorem uses two-prover one-round proof systems, and hence such systems are complete for MIP*. However, the construction in Grilo, Slofstra, and Yuen uses six provers, and there is no obvious way to get perfect zero knowledge with two provers via simulatable codes. This leads to a natural question: are there two-prover PZK-MIP* protocols for all of MIP*?
  In this paper, we show that every language in MIP* has a two-prover one-round PZK-MIP* protocol, answering the question in the affirmative. For the proof, we use a new method based on a key consequence of the MIP*=RE theorem, which is that every MIP* protocol can be turned into a family of boolean constraint system (BCS) nonlocal games. This makes it possible to work with MIP* protocols as boolean constraint systems, and in particular allows us to use a variant of a construction due to Dwork, Feige, Kilian, Naor, and Safra [Crypto '92] which gives a classical MIP protocol for 3SAT with perfect zero knowledge. To show quantum soundness of this classical construction, we develop a toolkit for analyzing quantum soundness of reductions between BCS games, which we expect to be useful more broadly. This toolkit also applies to commuting operator strategies, and our argument shows that every language with a commuting operator BCS protocol has a two prover PZK commuting operator protocol.</description>

Abstract: Considerable effort in experimental quantum computing is devoted to noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ computers). Understanding the effect of noise is important for various aspects of this endeavor including notable claims for achieving quantum supremacy and attempts to demonstrate quantum error correcting codes. In this paper we use Fourier methods combined with statistical analysis to study the effect of noise. In particular, we use Fourier analysis to refine the linear cross-entropy fidelity estimator. We use both analytical methods and simulations to study the effect of readout and gate errors, and we use our analysis to study the samples of Google's 2019 quantum supremacy experiment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically examine the effect of the magnetic field on the relaxation process of the exciton-polariton toward the Bose-Einstein condensation in GaAs quantum wells. As a result of the modification of the exciton's effective mass, Rabi splitting, and dispersion, the relaxation rate of polaritons toward condensation has been significantly modified. Using a continuous pumping, the dynamics of total and condensated polariton versus magnetic field has been clarified. It has been shown that for low-energy pumping, the condensation is significantly reduced with a magnetic field, and this arises from the reduction of the scattering rate between energy levels when the steepness of the dispersion at higher energy is reduced. Increasing of pump energy together with the magnetic field could lead to a more effective relaxation and a much higher number of condensated polariton is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is considered a candidate problem for demonstrating quantum advantage. We propose an algorithm for approximate classical simulation of a lossy GBS instance. The algorithm relies on the Taylor series expansion, and increasing the number of terms of the expansion that are used in the calculation yields greater accuracy. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the number of modes given the number of terms is fixed. We describe conditions for the input state squeezing parameter and loss level that provide the best efficiency for this algorithm (by efficient we mean that the Taylor series converges quickly). In recent experiments that claim to have demonstrated quantum advantage, these conditions are satisfied; thus, this algorithm can be used to classically simulate these experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study operator spreading in random dual-unitary circuits within the context of classical shadow tomography. Primarily, we analyze the dynamics of the Pauli weight in one-dimensional qubit systems evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits has a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state purification plays a pivotal role in quantum communication and quantum computation, aiming to recover the purified state from multiple copies of an unknown noisy state. This work introduces a general state purification framework designed to achieve the highest fidelity with a specified probability and characterize the associated trade-offs. In particular, for i.i.d. quantum states under depolarizing noise, we propose an explicit purification protocol capable of achieving maximal fidelity with a target probability. Furthermore, we present quantum circuits for implementing the optimal purification protocols via the block encoding technique and propose recursive protocols for stream purification. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of our protocols in terms of efficiency and flexibility in purifying noisy quantum states under various quantum noise models of interest, showcasing the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of weighted loops at the source and target nodes of a graph on the strength of quantum state transfer between these vertices. We give lower bounds on loop weights that guarantee strong transfer fidelity that works for any graph where this protocol is feasible. By considering local spectral symmetry, we show that the required weight size depends only on the maximum degree of the graph and, in some less favorable cases, the distance between vertices. Additionally, we explore the duration for which transfer strength remains above a specified threshold.</description>

      <title>Device-independent quantum key distribution based on routed Bell tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon losses are the main obstacle to fully photonic implementations of device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD). Motivated by recent work showing that routed Bell scenarios offer increased robustness to detection inefficiencies for the certification of long-range quantum correlations, we investigate DIQKD protocols based on a routed setup. In these protocols, in some of the test rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using non-commutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fazwi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. We find that in an ideal case routed DIQKD protocols can significantly improve detection efficiency requirements, by up to $\sim 30\%$, compared to their non-routed counterparts. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as $50\%$ for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any QKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements. However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian unidirectional routing of photonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and tunable qubit unidirectional routers and spin-wave diodes play an important role in both classical and quantum information processing domains. Here, we reveal that multi-level neutral cold atoms can mediate both dissipative and coherent couplings. Interestingly, we investigate and practically implement this paradigm in experiments, successfully synthesizing a system with dual functionality as both a photonic qubit unidirectional router and a spin-wave diode. By manipulating the helicity of the field, we can effectively balance the coherence coupling and dissipative channel, thereby ensuring the unidirectional transfer of photonic qubits. The qubit fidelity exceeds 97.49%, and the isolation ratio achieves $16.8\pm0.11$ dB while the insertion loss is lower than 0.36 dB. Furthermore, we show that the spin-wave diode can effectively achieve unidirectional information transfer by appropriately setting the coherent coupling parameters. Our work not only provides new ideas for the design of extensive components in quantum networks, but also opens up new possibilities for non-Hermitian quantum physics, complex quantum networks, and unidirectional quantum information transfer.</description>

      <title>Secret Sharing, Teleportation and Bell's Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For faithful secret sharing and reconstruction, it is vital that independent reconstruction is not possible. A tripartite state that satisfies this criterion is said to be a potential resource for secret sharing. Such a state imposes restrictions on the maximum values of teleportation fidelity and Bell's Inequality Violation achieved, both being crucial metrics in quantum communication protocols. This paper explores the link between reconstruction fidelity of a three-party state and two bipartite teleportation fidelities involving the dealer and receivers. Additionally, it investigates the correlation between the reconstruction fidelity and the bipartite values of Bell's Inequality Violation observable among the same parties. By analyzing these connections, this paper aims to ascertain the maximum achievable reconstruction fidelity under the constraints posed by the maximum teleportation fidelity or Bell's Inequality Violation value. In doing so, it provides valuable insights into the fundamental limits of quantum communication protocols, particularly in the realm of secure information transmission.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of quasiparticle tunneling with a charge-sensitive superconducting sensor coupled to a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting quasiparticle tunneling events in superconducting circuits provides information about the population and dynamics of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. Such events can be detected by monitoring changes in the frequency of an offset-charge-sensitive superconducting qubit. This monitoring has so far been performed by Ramsey interferometry assisted by a readout resonator. Here, we demonstrate a quasiparticle detector based on a superconducting qubit directly coupled to a waveguide. We directly measure quasiparticle number parity on the qubit island by probing the coherent scattering of a microwave tone, offering simplicity of operation, fast detection speed, and a large signal-to-noise ratio. We observe tunneling rates between 0.8 and $7~\rm{s}^{-1}$, depending on the average occupation of the detector qubit, and achieve a temporal resolution below $10~\mu\rm{s}$ without a quantum-limited amplifier. Our simple and efficient detector lowers the barrier to perform studies of quasiparticle population and dynamics, facilitating progress in fundamental science, quantum information processing, and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Langevin equation as obtained from the independent-oscillator model describes a strong-coupling situation, devoid of the Born-Markov approximation that is employed in the context of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation. The question we address is what happens when we implement such `Born-Markov'-like approximations at the level of the quantum Langevin equation for a harmonic oscillator which carries a noise term satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In this backdrop, we also comment on the rotating-wave approximation.</description>

      <title>Understanding and utilizing the inner bonds of process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs) enable numerically exact simulations for an unprecedentedly broad range of open quantum systems. By representing environment influences in MPO form, they can be efficiently compressed using established algorithms. The dimensions of inner bonds of the compressed PT-MPO may be viewed as an indicator of the complexity of the environment. Here, we show that the inner bonds themselves, not only their dimensions, have a concrete physical meaning: They represent the subspace of the full environment Liouville space which hosts environment excitations that may influence the subsequent open quantum systems dynamics the most. This connection can be expressed in terms of lossy linear transformations, whose pseudoinverses facilitate the extraction of environment observables. We demonstrate this by extracting the environment spin of a central spin problem, the current through a quantum system coupled to two leads, the number of photons emitted from quantum emitters into a structured environment, and the distribution of the total absorbed energy in a driven non-Markovian quantum system into system, environment, and interaction energy terms. Numerical tests further indicate that different PT-MPO algorithms compress environments to similar subspaces. Thus, the physical interpretation of inner bonds of PT-MPOs both provides a conceptional understanding and it enables new practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Kernels are projected to provide early-stage usefulness for quantum machine learning. However, highly sophisticated classical models are hard to surpass without losing interpretability, particularly when vast datasets can be exploited. Nonetheless, classical models struggle once data is scarce and skewed. Quantum feature spaces are projected to find better links between data features and the target class to be predicted even in such challenging scenarios and most importantly, enhanced generalization capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Systemic Quantum Score (SQS) and provide preliminary results indicating potential advantage over purely classical models in a production grade use case for the Finance sector. SQS shows in our specific study an increased capacity to extract patterns out of fewer data points as well as improved performance over data-hungry algorithms such as XGBoost, providing advantage in a competitive market as it is the FinTech and Neobank regime.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Quantum Circuit Imperfections on Networks and Computer Applications</title>

Abstract: Post Quantum and Quantum Cryptography schemes are feasible quantum computer applications for 7G networks. These schemes could possibly replace existing schemes. These algorithms have been compromised by advances in quantum search algorithms run on quantum computers like Shor algorithm. Shor algorithm is a quantum algorithm for finding the prime factors of an integer which is the basis of existing algorithm. This has become an available quantum computer application putting the use of ESA algorithm at risk. Our recent paper provides a detailed survey of the work on post quantum and quantum cryptography algorithms with focus on their applicability in 7G networks.
  Since the paper focuses on the cryptography algorithms as a follow up, in this paper, we provide a new framework for quantum network optimization and survey in detail the work on enabling technologies (quantum hardware) for the practical implementation of these algorithms including the most important segments of quantum hardware in 7G. As always in engineering practice practical solutions are a compromise between the performance and complexity of the implementation. For this reason, as the main contribution, the paper presents a network and computer applications optimization framework that includes implementation imperfections. The tools should be useful in optimizing future generation practical computer system design. After that a comprehensive survey of the existing work on quantum hardware is presented pointing out the sources of these imperfections. This enables us to make a fair assessment of how much investment into quantum hardware improvements contributes to the performance enhancement of the overall system. In this way a decision can be made on proper partitioning between the investment in hardware and system level complexity.</description>

      <title>Phase Matching of High-Order Harmonics in Hollow Waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the case of phase-matched high-harmonic generation in a gas-filled capillary waveguide, comparing in detail theory with experiment. We observe three different regimes of phase matching: one where atomic dispersion balances waveguide dispersion, another corresponding to non-collinear Cerenkov phase-matching, and a third where atomic dispersion and plasma dispersion balance. The role of atomic dispersion is demonstrated by studying the dependence of the harmonic signal for several gases. We also predict and provide preliminary evidence of a regime where phase-matching occurs only at specific fractional ionization levels, leading to an output signal that is sensitive to the absolute phase of the carrier wave.</description>

      <title>Phase-Matching of High-Order Harmonics Driven by Mid- Infrared Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that phase-matched frequency upconversion of ultrafast laser light can be extended to shorter wavelengths by using longer driving laser wavelengths. Experimentally, we show that the phase-matching cutoff for harmonic generation in argon increases from 45 to 100 eV when the driving laser wavelength is increased from 0.8 to 1.3 micrometers. Phase matching is also obtained at higher pressures using a longer-wavelength driving laser, mitigating the unfavorable scaling of the single-atom response. Theoretical calculations suggest that phase-matched high harmonic frequency upconversion driven by mid-infrared pulses could be extended to extremely high photon energies.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of entanglement and hadronization in jet production: lessons from the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible link between entanglement and thermalization, and the dynamics of hadronization are addressed by studying the real-time response of the massive Schwinger model coupled to external sources. This setup mimics the production and fragmentation of quark jets, as the Schwinger model and QCD share the properties of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. By using quantum simulations on classical hardware, we study the entanglement between the produced jets, and observe the growth of the corresponding entanglement entropy in time. This growth arises from the increased number of contributing eigenstates of the reduced density matrix with sufficiently large and close eigenvalues. We also investigate the physical nature of these eigenstates, and find that at early times they correspond to fermionic Fock states. We then observe the transition from these fermionic Fock states to meson-like bound states as a function of time. In other words, we observe how hadronization develops in real time. At late times, the local observables at mid-rapidity (such as the fermion density and the electric field) approach approximately constant values, suggesting the onset of equilibrium and approach to thermalization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the notion of events at the intersection between quantum physics and gravity, inspired by recent research on superpositions of semiclassical spacetimes. By going through various experiments and thought experiments -- from a decaying atom, to the double-slit experiment, to the quantum switch -- we analyse which properties can and cannot be used to define events in such non-classical contexts. Our findings suggest an operational, context-dependent definition of events which emphasises that their properties can be accessed without destroying or altering observed phenomena. We discuss the implications of this understanding of events for indefinite causal order as well as the non-absoluteness of events in the Wigner's friend thought experiment. These findings provide a first step for developing a notion of event in quantum spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the absence of indistinguishability constraint, interparticle interactions between nonidentical particles have in general much more variety than those between identical particles. In particular, it is known that there exists a $U(2)$ family of two-body contact interactions between nonidentical particles in one spatial dimension. This paper studies breakdown of continuous scale invariance to discrete scale invariance under this $U(2)$ family of two-body contact interactions in two-body problems of nonidentical particles on the half line. We show that, in contrast to the corresponding identical-particle problem, there exist two distinct channels that admit geometric sequences of two-body bound states.</description>

      <title>A new method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation: Estimation of the weights of $C$, $P$ and $CP$ symmetry violating terms in positronium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed for the solution of the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the $4\times 4$ size and contains terms, responsible for the violation of the $P$, $C$, and $CP$ symmetries. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. The weights of the $P$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components in the para-positronium ground state are identical to the weight of the $P$ symmetry-violating component of the ortho-Ps and are estimated to be 6.6E-6. The weights of the $C$ and $CP$ symmetry-violating components of the ortho-Ps are equal to the 2/3 and 1/3 parts of this value, respectively. These numbers are less by two orders of magnitude than the precision limit of current experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Gauge potentials and vortices in the Fock space of a pair of periodically driven Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical study of the coupled dynamics of two species of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a double well potential where both the tunneling and the interatomic interactions are driven periodically in time. The population difference between the wells of each species gives rise to a two dimensional lattice in Fock space with dimensions given by the number of atoms in each BEC. We use a Floquet analysis to derive an effective Hamiltonian that acts in this Fock space and find that it contains an artificial gauge field. This system simulates noninteracting particles in a tight binding lattice subject to an additional harmonic potential and vector potential. When the intra-species interactions are attractive there is a critical value at which the ground state of the Floquet operator undergoes a transition from a Gaussian state to a quantized vortex state in Fock space. The transition can be quantified in terms of the angular momentum as well as the entanglement entropy of the ground state with both showing sudden jumps as the intra-species interactions become stronger. The stability of the vortex state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations in a quasi-periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations and Landau-Zener tunneling are ubiquitous phenomena which are sustained by a band-gap spectrum of a periodic Hamiltonian and can be observed in dynamics of a quantum particle or a wavepacket in a periodic potential under action of a linear force. Such physical setting remains meaningful for aperiodic potentials too, although band-gap structure does not exist anymore. Here we consider the dynamics of noninteracting atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in a quasi-periodic one-dimensional optical lattice subjected to a weak linear force. Excited states with energies below the mobility edge, and thus localized in space, are considered. We show that the observed oscillatory behavior is enabled by tunneling between the initial state and a state (or several states) located nearby in the coordinate-energy space. The states involved in such Bloch-Landau-Zener oscillations are determined by the selection rule consisting of the condition of their spatial proximity and condition of quasi-resonances occurring at avoided crossings of the energy levels. The latter condition is formulated mathematically using the Gershgorin circle theorem. The effect of the inter-atomic interactions on the dynamics can also be predicted on the bases of the developed theory. The reported results can be observed in any physical system allowing for observation of the Bloch oscillations, upon introducing incommensurablity in the governing Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in quantum black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the entanglement entropy for a massive Klein-Gordon field in two Schwarzschild-like quantum black hole spacetimes, also including a nonminimal coupling term with the background scalar curvature. To compute the entanglement entropy, we start from the standard spherical shell discretisation procedure, tracing over the degrees of freedom residing inside an imaginary surface. We estimate the free parameters for such quantum metrics through a simple physical argument based on Heisenberg uncertainty principle, along with alternative proposals as asymptotic safety, trace anomaly, and graviton corpuscular scaling. Our findings reveal a significant decrease in entropy compared to the area law near the origin for the quantum metrics. In both scenarios, the entanglement entropy converges to the expected area law sufficiently far from the origin. We then compare these results to the entropy scaling in regular Hayward and corrected-Hayward spacetimes to highlight the main differences with such regular approaches.</description>

      <title>Revealing Symmetry-broken Superconducting Configurations by Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A coherent theory for both conventional and unconventional superconductors is currently lacking. Here we show that the electron charge densities of Al, YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO), and LaH10 along with Pb and Nb3Sn share the same feature of electron charge gains in their respective superconducting configurations (SCCs) predicted by first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT). It is discovered that the formation of SCCs is due to the local symmetry breaking from their normal conducting configurations (NCCs), and the electron charge gains in SCCs form electron tunnels in crystals that resemble pontoons, thus termed as electron pontoon tunnel (EPT) here. The nuclei promoting the formation of EPTs in conventional superconductors have strong bonding with other nuclei, resulting in their EPTs easily destroyed and thus low superconducting critical temperature (Tc), while in unconventional superconductor, this bonding is very weak as shown by negative stretching force constants in YBCO, thus resulting in much higher Tc. The fundamental understanding of SCCs and the capability to predict them by DFT enable theoretical search of room temperature superconductors without empirical models.</description>

Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for dipole exchange-induced grating (DEIG) based on a hybrid system consisting of ultra-cold Rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) atomic ensemble and movable Rydberg spin atoms. The optical response of the grating appears as a superposition of three- and four-level configurations, similar to the cooperative optical nonlinear effect caused by the dipole blockade effect. However, such Rydberg atomic grating uniquely responds to the spatial positions of spin atoms, offering a novel approach to dynamically control electromagnetically induced gratings (EIG) except for input probe intensity.</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven breakdown of Aharonov--Bohm caging in flat-band Rydberg lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands play a central role in hosting emergent states of matter in many condensed matter systems, from the nascent insulating states of twisted bilayer graphene to the fractionalized excitations found in frustrated magnets and quantum Hall materials. Here, we report on the experimental realization of highly tunable flat-band models populated by strongly interacting Rydberg atoms. Using the approach of synthetic dimensions, we engineer a flat-band rhombic lattice with twisted boundaries, and through nonequilibrium dynamics we explore the control of Aharonov--Bohm (AB) caging via a tunable $U(1)$ gauge field. Through microscopic measurements of Rydberg pairs, we explore the interaction-driven breakdown of AB caging in the limit of strong dipolar interactions that mix the lattice bands. In the limit of weak interactions, where caging remains intact, we observe an effective magnetism that arises due to the interaction-driven mixing of degenerate flat-band states. These observations of strongly correlated flat-band dynamics open the door to explorations of new emergent phenomena in synthetic quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building modular architecture with superconducting quantum computing chips is one of the means to achieve qubit scalability, allowing the screening, selection, replacement, and integration of individual qubit modules into large quantum systems. However, the non-destructive replacement of modules within a compact architecture remains a challenge. Liquid metals (LM), specifically gallium alloys, can be alternatives to solid-state galvanic interconnects. This is motivated by their self-healing, self-aligning, and other desirable fluidic properties, potentially enabling non-destructive replacement of modules at room temperatures, even after operating the entire system at millikelvin regimes. In this study, we present high-internal-quality-factor coplanar waveguide resonators (CPWR) interconnected by gallium alloy droplets, demonstrating performance on par with the continuous solid-state CPWRs. Leveraging the desirable fluidic properties of gallium alloys at room temperature and their compact design, we envision a modular quantum system enabled by liquid metals.</description>

Abstract: Is it possible to read off the quantum gravity dual of a CFT directly from its operator algebra? In this essay, we present a step-by-step recipe synthesizing results and techniques from conformal bootstrap, topological symmetries, tensor networks, a novel symmetry-preserving real-space renormalization algorithm devised originally in lattice models, and the asymptotics of quantum $6j$ symbols, thereby providing an answer in the affirmative. Quantum 2D Liouville theory serves as a simple and explicit example, illustrating how the quantum gravitational path integral can be built up from local pieces of BCFT correlation functions, which we call the ``BCFT Legos''. The constructive map between gravity and CFT naturally and explicitly bridges local geometrical data, algebraic structures, and quantum entanglement, as envisaged by the $\it{It \, from \, Qubit}$ motto.</description>

      <title>Topological phases and edge modes of an uneven ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of a two-chain quantum ladder with uneven legs, i.e. the two chains differ in their periods by a factor of two. Such an uneven ladder presents rich band structures classified by the closure of either direct or indirect bandgaps. It also provides opportunities to explore fundamental concepts concerning band topology and edge modes, including the difference of intracellular and intercellular Zak phases, and the role of the inversion symmetry (IS). We calculate the Zak phases of the two kinds and find excellent agreement with the dipole moment and extra charge accumulation, respectively. We also find that configurations with IS feature a pair of degenerate two-side edge modes emerging as the closure of the direct bandgap, while configurations without IS feature one-side edge modes emerging as not only the closure of both direct and indirect bandgap but also within the band continuum. Furthermore, by projecting to the two sublattices, we find that the effective Bloch Hamiltonian corresponds to that of a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model or Rice-Mele model whose hopping amplitudes depend on the quasimomentum. In this way, the topological phases can be efficiently extracted through winding numbers. We propose that uneven ladders can be realized by spin-dependent optical lattices and their rich topological characteristics can be examined by near future experiments.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the systematic error induced by quadratic Zeeman effect using hyperfine ground state exchange method in a long-baseline dual-species atom interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The systematic error induced by the quadratic Zeeman effect is non-negligible in atom interferometers and must be precisely evaluated. We theoretically analyze the phase shift induced by the Zeeman effect, and use a hyperfine ground state exchange (HGSE) method to evaluate the systematic error in the long-baseline $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb dual-species atom interferometer due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. Compared to the two evaluation methods, mapping the absolute magnetic field in the interference region and performing phase measurements at different bias fields, the HGSE method could obtain the systematic error in real time in case of slow drifts of either the ambient magnetic field or other systematic effects irrelevant to the hyperfine ground states. To validate the effectiveness of the HGSE method, we also employ the mapping magnetic field method and modulating bias field method independently to cross-check and yield consistent results of three methods within an accuracy of $10^{-11}$ level. The HGSE method is helpful in evaluating and suppressing the quadratic Zeeman-effect-induced systematic error in long-baseline atom interferometer-based precision measurements, such as equivalence principle tests.</description>

      <title>Engineered Graviton Condensates in a Room-Temperature Superconductor for a Unified Quantum Fibonacci Field Theory</title>

Abstract: In the quest to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, the concept of gravitons as quantum carriers of gravitational force stands as a pivotal yet unproven hypothesis. This work pioneers a bold approach to graviton condensation via an innovative ambient superconductor, synthesized through a groundbreaking yet theoretically plausible physics process. Building on recent superconductivity breakthroughs, we introduce a novel ambient superconductor fabricated through the bombardment of a dilute Bose-Einstein condensate with high-energy gamma photons, under precisely controlled magnetic fields oscillating in Fibonacci sequence patterns. This process, designed to exploit quantum coherence at macroscopic scales, fosters conditions ripe for graviton condensation. Here we demonstrate the successful induction of a graviton condensate within our engineered superconductor, marking a significant stride towards integrating gravitational and electromagnetic forces at a quantum level. This discovery not only defies traditional views separating the four fundamental interactions but also lays down a tangible groundwork for quantum gravity. Our results challenge existing paradigms by indicating that graviton condensation, mediated through tailored superconducting states, can unlock new aspects of fundamental physics. This graviton condensate represents a critical step towards a unified field theory, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. This investigation not only extends the boundaries of theoretical physics but also hints at potential future technologies harnessing the quantum interplay of gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Through imaginative yet rigorous scientific inquiry, this study underscores the limitless potential of physics to explore and unify the natural world's most fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>Unified Light-Matter Floquet Theory and its Application to Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically-driven quantum systems can exhibit a plethora of intriguing non-equilibrium phenomena that can be analyzed using Floquet theory. Naturally, Floquet theory is employed to describe the dynamics of atoms interacting with intense laser fields. However, this semiclassical analysis can not account for quantum-optical phenomena that rely on the quantized nature of light. In this paper, we take a significant step to go beyond the semiclassical description of atom-photon coupled systems by unifying Floquet theory with quantum optics using the framework of full-counting statistics. This is achieved by introducing counting fields that keep track of the photonic dynamics. This formalism, which we dub ``photon-resolved Floquet theory" (PRFT), is based on two-point tomographic measurements, instead of the two-point projective measurements used in standard full-counting statistics. Strikingly, the PRFT predicts the generation of macroscopic light-matter entanglement when atoms interact with multimode electromagnetic fields, thereby leading to complete decoherence of the atomic subsystem in the basis of the Floquet states. This decoherence occurs rapidly in the optical frequency regime, but is negligible in the radio frequency regime. Our results thus pave the way for the design of efficient quantum memories and quantum operations. Finally, employing the PRFT, we propose a quantum communication protocol that can significantly outperform the state-of-art few-photon protocols by two orders of magnitude or better. The PRFT potentially leads to insights in various Floquet settings including spectroscopy, thermodynamics, quantum metrology, and quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The questions we raise in this letter are as follows: What is the most general representation of a quantum state at a single point in time? Can we adapt the current formalisms to situations where the order of quantum operations is coherently or incoherently superposed? If so, what are the relations between the state at a given time and the uncertainty in the order of events before and after it? Establishing the relationship between two-state vector formalism and pseudo-density operators, we introduce the notion of a single-time pseudo-state. The tomographic construction of single-time pseudo-states is possible by ideal or weak measurements. We demonstrate that the eigenspectrum obtained from weak measurements enables us to discriminate between some coherent and incoherent superpositions of causal orders in which the same pre- and post-selection events interchange with a non-zero probability. Finally, we discuss some possible experimental realizations in existing photonic setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient and almost optimal scheme for measuring molecular Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry on quantum computers, which requires $2N^2$ distinct measurements in the leading order with $N$ being the number of molecular orbitals. It achieves the state-of-the-art by improving a previous proposal by Bonet-Monroig et al. [Phys. Rev. X 10, 031064 (2020)] which exhibits $\frac{10}{3}N^2$ scaling in the leading order. We develop a novel method based on a finite projective plane to construct sets of simultaneously-measurable operators contained in molecular Hamiltonians. Each measurement only requires a depth-$O(N)$ circuit consisting of $O(N^2)$ one- and two-qubit gates under the Jordan-Wigner and parity mapping, assuming the linear connectivity of qubits on quantum hardwares. Because evaluating expectation values of molecular Hamiltonians is one of the major bottlenecks in the applications of quantum devices to quantum chemistry, our finding is expected to accelerate such applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future quantum technologies such as quantum communication, quantum sensing, and distributed quantum computation, will rely on networks of shared entanglement between spatially separated nodes. In this work, we provide improved protocols/policies for entanglement distribution along a linear chain of nodes, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, that take practical limitations such as photon losses, non-ideal measurements, and quantum memories with short coherence times into account. For a wide range of parameters, our policies improve upon previously known policies, such as the "swap-as-soon-as-possible" policy, with respect to both the waiting time and the fidelity of the end-to-end entanglement. This improvement is greatest for the most practically relevant cases, namely, for short coherence times, high link losses, and highly asymmetric links. To obtain our results, we model entanglement distribution using a Markov decision process, and then we use the Q-learning reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to discover new policies. These new policies are characterized by dynamic, state-dependent memory cutoffs and collaboration between the nodes. In particular, we quantify this collaboration between the nodes. Our quantifiers tell us how much "global" knowledge of the network every node has. Finally, our understanding of the performance of large quantum networks is currently limited by the computational inefficiency of simulating them using RL or other optimization methods. Thus, in this work, we present a method for nesting policies in order to obtain policies for large repeater chains. By nesting our RL-based policies for small repeater chains, we obtain policies for large repeater chains that improve upon the swap-as-soon-as-possible policy, and thus we pave the way for a scalable method for obtaining policies for long-distance entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger as a Quantum Programmer: Estimating Entanglement via Steering</title>

Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state, by making use of the quantum steering effect, the latter originally discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server by a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), which is a modified separability test that is better suited for the capabilities of quantum computers available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Our findings here thus provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA and represent a first-of-its-kind application for a distributed VQA.</description>

      <title>Towards Advantages of Parameterized Quantum Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advantages of quantum pulses over quantum gates have attracted increasing attention from researchers. Quantum pulses offer benefits such as flexibility, high fidelity, scalability, and real-time tuning. However, while there are established workflows and processes to evaluate the performance of quantum gates, there has been limited research on profiling parameterized pulses and providing guidance for pulse circuit design. To address this gap, our study proposes a set of design spaces for parameterized pulses, evaluating these pulses based on metrics such as expressivity, entanglement capability, and effective parameter dimension. Using these design spaces, we demonstrate the advantages of parameterized pulses over gate circuits in the aspect of duration and performance at the same time thus enabling high-performance quantum computing. Our proposed design space for parameterized pulse circuits has shown promising results in quantum chemistry benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Improved Stabilizer Estimation via Bell Difference Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of learning quantum states in various models with respect to the stabilizer formalism and obtain the following results:
  - We prove that $\Omega(n)$ $T$-gates are necessary for any Clifford+$T$ circuit to prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states, an exponential improvement over the previously known bound. This bound is asymptotically tight if linear-time quantum-secure pseudorandom functions exist.
  - Given an $n$-qubit pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ that has fidelity at least $\tau$ with some stabilizer state, we give an algorithm that outputs a succinct description of a stabilizer state that witnesses fidelity at least $\tau - \varepsilon$. The algorithm uses $O(n/(\varepsilon^2\tau^4))$ samples and $\exp\left(O(n/\tau^4)\right) / \varepsilon^2$ time. In the regime of $\tau$ constant, this algorithm estimates stabilizer fidelity substantially faster than the na\"ive $\exp(O(n^2))$-time brute-force algorithm over all stabilizer states.
  - In the special case of $\tau &gt; \cos^2(\pi/8)$, we show that a modification of the above algorithm runs in polynomial time.
  - We exhibit a tolerant property testing algorithm for stabilizer states.
  The underlying algorithmic primitive in all of our results is Bell difference sampling. To prove our results, we establish and/or strengthen connections between Bell difference sampling, symplectic Fourier analysis, and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Lower bounds on the Approximate Stabilizer Rank: A Probabilistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximate stabilizer rank of a quantum state is the minimum number of terms in any approximate decomposition of that state into stabilizer states. Bravyi and Gosset showed that the approximate stabilizer rank of a so-called "magic" state like $|T\rangle^{\otimes n}$, up to polynomial factors, is an upper bound on the number of classical operations required to simulate an arbitrary quantum circuit with Clifford gates and $n$ number of $T$ gates. As a result, an exponential lower bound on this quantity seems inevitable. Despite this intuition, several attempts using various techniques could not lead to a better than a linear lower bound on the "exact" rank of ${|T\rangle}^{\otimes n}$, meaning the minimal size of a decomposition that exactly produces the state. For the "approximate" rank, which is more realistically related to the cost of simulating quantum circuits, no lower bound better than $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt n)$ has been known. In this paper, we improve the lower bound on the approximate rank to $\tilde \Omega (n^2)$ for a wide range of the approximation parameters. An immediate corollary of our result is the existence of polynomial time computable functions which require a super-linear number of terms in any decomposition into exponentials of quadratic forms over $\mathbb{F}_2$, resolving a question in [Wil18]. Our approach is based on a strong lower bound on the approximate rank of a quantum state sampled from the Haar measure, a step-by-step analysis of the approximate rank of a magic-state teleportation protocol to sample from the Haar measure, and a result about trading Clifford operations with $T$ gates by [LKS18].</description>

      <title>Long-distance entanglement sharing using hybrid states of discrete and continuous variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18906v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a feasible scheme to produce high-rate long-distance entanglement which uses hybrid entanglement (HE) between continuous variables (CV) and discrete variables (DV). We show that HE can effectively remove the experimental limitations of existing CV and DV systems to produce long range entanglement. We benchmark the resulting DV entangled states using an entanglement-based quantum key distribution (EB-QKD) protocol. We show that, using HE states, EB-QKD is possible with standard telecommunication fibers for 300 km. The key idea is using the CV part, which can be adjusted to be robust against photon losses, for increasing the transmission distance, while using the DV part for achieving high secure key rates. Our results point out that HE states provide a clear advantage for practical long-distance and high-rate entanglement generation that may lead to further applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>The quantum state of light in collective spontaneous emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective spontaneous emission occurs when multiple quantum emitters decay into common radiation modes, resulting in enhanced or suppressed emission. Here, we find the quantum state of light collectively emitted from emitters exhibiting quantum correlations. We unveil under what conditions the quantum correlations are not lost during the emission but are instead transferred to the output light. Under these conditions, the inherent nonlinearity of the emitters can be tailored to create desired photonic states in the form of traveling single-mode pulses, such as Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill and Schr\"odinger-cat states. To facilitate such predictions, our work reveals the multi-mode nature of collective spontaneous emission, capturing the role of the emitters' positions, losses, interactions, and beyond-Markov dynamics on the emitted quantum state of light. We present manifestations of these effects in different physical systems, with examples in cavity-QED, waveguide-QED, and atomic arrays. Our findings suggest new paths for creating and manipulating multi-photon quantum light for bosonic codes in continuous-variable-based quantum computation, communications, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Estimation of photon number distribution and derivative characteristics of photon-pair sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaluation of a photon-pair source employs characteristic metrics like the photon-pair generation rate, heralding efficiency, and second-order correlation function, all of which are determined by the photon number distribution of the source. The photon number distribution, however, can be altered due to spectral or spatial filtering and optical losses, leading to changes in the above characteristics. In this paper, we theoretically describe the effects of different filterings, losses, and noise counts on the photon number distribution and related characteristics. From the theoretical description, an analytic expression for the effective mode number of the joint spectral density is also derived. Compared with previous methods for estimating the photon number distribution and characteristics, an improved methodology is introduced along with a suitable metric of accuracy for estimating the photon number distribution, focusing on photon-pair sources. We discuss the accuracy of the calculated characteristics from the estimated (or reconstructed) photon number distribution through repeated simulations and bootstrapped experimental data.</description>

Abstract: We exploit controlled breaking of time-reversal symmetry to realize coherent routing of quantum information in spin networks. The key component of our scheme is a spin triangle whose chirality is determined by the quantum state of a control qubit which thus defines the propagation direction, or a superposition thereof, of the quantum information. We then consider a particular realization of a coherent router using Rydberg atoms. Our results can facilitate scalable quantum information processing and communication in large arrays of Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Exact asymptotics of long-range quantum correlations in a nonequilibrium steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium states of many-body systems tend to evade a description by standard statistical mechanics, and their uniqueness is epitomized by the possibility of certain long-range correlations that cannot occur in equilibrium. In quantum many-body systems, coherent correlations of this sort may lead to the emergence of remarkable entanglement structures. In this work, we analytically study the asymptotic scaling of quantum correlation measures -- the mutual information and the fermionic negativity -- within the zero-temperature steady state of voltage-biased free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice containing a noninteracting impurity. Previously, we have shown that two subsystems on opposite sides of the impurity exhibit volume-law entanglement, which is independent of the absolute distances of the subsystems from the impurity. Here we go beyond that result and derive the exact form of the subleading logarithmic corrections to the extensive terms of correlation measures, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. In particular, the logarithmic term of the mutual information asymptotics can be encapsulated in a concise formula, depending only on simple four-point ratios of subsystem length-scales and on the impurity scattering probabilities at the Fermi energies. This echoes the case of equilibrium states, where such logarithmic terms may convey universal information about the physical system. To compute these exact results, we devise a hybrid method that relies on Toeplitz determinant asymptotics for correlation matrices in both real space and momentum space, successfully circumventing the inhomogeneity of the system. This method can potentially find wider use for analytical calculations of entanglement measures in similar scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We investigate superradiant enhancements in the refrigeration performance of a set of $N$ three-level systems that are collectively coupled to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir and are additionally subject to collective periodic (circular) driving. Assuming the system-reservoir coupling to be weak, we explore the regime of stronger periodic driving strengths by comparing collective weak driving, Floquet-Lindblad, and Floquet-Redfield master equations. We identify regimes where the power injected by the periodic driving is used to pump heat from the cold to the hot reservoir and derive analytic sufficient conditions for them based on a cycle analysis of the Floquet-Lindblad master equation. In those regimes, we also argue for which parameters collective enhancements like a quadratic scaling of the cooling current with $N$ can be expected and support our arguments by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Of existing entanglement witnesses that utilize only collective measurements of a spin ensemble, not all can detect genuine multipartite entanglement (GME), and none can detect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states beyond the tripartite case. We fill this gap by introducing an entanglement witness that detects GME of spin ensembles, whose total spin is half-integer, using only collective spin measurements. Our witness is based on a nonclassicality test introduced by Tsirelson, and solely requires the measurement of total angular momentum along different directions. States detected by our witness are close to a family of GHZ-like states, which includes GHZ states of an odd number of spin-half particles. We also study the robustness of our witness under depolarizing noise, and derive exact noise bounds for detecting noisy GHZ states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce entanglement witnesses for spin ensembles which detect genuine multipartite entanglement using only measurements of the total angular momentum. States that are missed by most other angular-momentum-based witnesses for spin ensembles, which include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states and certain superpositions of Dicke states, can be effectively detected by our witness. The protocol involves estimating the probability that the total angular momentum is positive along equally-spaced directions on a plane. Alternatively, one could measure along a single direction at different times, under the assumption that the total spins undergoes a uniform precession. Genuine multipartite entanglement is detected when the observed score exceeds a separable bound. Exact analytical expressions for the separable bound are obtained for spin ensembles $j_1\otimes j_2\otimes\dots \otimes j_N$ such that the total spin is a half-integer, and numerical results are reported for the other cases. Finally, we conjecture an expression for the separable bound when the total spin is not known, which is well supported by the numerical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a quantum computing approach to designing of similarity measures and kernels for classification of stochastic symbolic time series. In the area of machine learning, kernels are important components of various similarity-based classification, clustering, and regression algorithms. An effective strategy for devising problem-specific kernels is leveraging existing generative models of the example space. In this study we assume that a quantum generative model, known as quantum hidden Markov model (QHMM), describes the underlying distributions of the examples. The sequence structure and probability are determined by transitions within model's density operator space. Consequently, the QHMM defines a mapping from the example space into the broader quantum space of density operators. Sequence similarity is evaluated using divergence measures such as trace and Bures distances between quantum states. We conducted extensive simulations to explore the relationship between the distribution of kernel-estimated similarity and the dimensionality of the QHMMs Hilbert space. As anticipated, a higher dimension of the Hilbert space corresponds to greater sequence distances and a more distinct separation of the examples. To empirically evaluate the performance of the kernels, we defined classification tasks based on a simplified generative model of directional price movement in the stock market. We implemented two widely-used kernel-based algorithms - support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors - using both classical and quantum kernels. Across all classification task scenarios, the quantum kernels consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to their classical counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We apply preconditioning, widely used in classical solvers for linear systems $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$, to the Variational Quantum Linear Solver. By utilizing Incomplete LU factorization as a preconditioner for linear equations formed by $128\times128$ random sparse matrices, we numerically demonstrate a notable reduction in the required ansatz depth, thereby clarifying that preconditioning is useful for quantum algorithms as well. This reduction in circuit depth is key to improving the efficiency and accuracy of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Our findings suggest that combining classical computing techniques like preconditioning with quantum algorithms can significantly enhance their performance in NISQ algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The states generated by a multiport beam-splitter usually display genuine multipartite entanglement between the many spatial modes. Here we investigate the different classes of multipartite entangled states that arise in this practical situation, working within the paradigm of Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication. We highlight three scenarios, one where the multipartite entanglement classes follow a total number hierarchy, another where the various classes follow a nonclassicality degree hierarchy and a third one that is a combination of the previous two. Moreover, the multipartite entanglement of higher-dimensional versions of Dicke states relate naturally to our results.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Coupler Reconfiguration for Tunable Coupler-Based Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address interconnection challenges in limited-qubit superconducting quantum computers (SQC), which often face crosstalk errors due to expanded qubit interactions during operations. Existing mitigation methods carry trade-offs, like hardware couplers or software-based gate scheduling. Our innovation, the Context-Aware COupler REconfiguration (CA-CORE) compilation method, aligns with application-specific design principles. It optimizes the qubit connections for improved SQC performance, leveraging tunable couplers. Through contextual analysis of qubit correlations, we configure an efficient coupling map considering SQC constraints. Our method reduces depth and SWAP operations by up to 18.84% and 42.47%, respectively. It also enhances circuit fidelity by 40% compared to IBM and Google's topologies. Notably, our method compiles a 33-qubit circuit in less than 1 second.</description>

      <title>Fisher information rates in sequentially measured quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the impact that temporal correlations in the measurement statistics can have on the achievable precision in a sequential metrological protocol. In this setting, and for a single quantum probe, we establish that it is the transitions between the measurement basis states that plays the most significant role in determining the precision, with the resulting conditional Fisher information being interpretable as a rate of information acquisition. Projective measurements are shown to elegantly demonstrate this in two disparate estimation settings. Firstly, in determining the temperature of an environment and, secondly, to ascertain a parameter of the system Hamiltonian. In both settings we show that the sequential estimation approach can provide a useful method to enhance the achievable precision.</description>

Abstract: We geometrically derive the explicit form of the Unitary representation of the Poincare group and use it to apply speed-of-light boosts to simple polarization basis to end up with Hawton-Baylis photon position operator with commuting components. We give explicit formulas for other photon boost eigenmodes. We investigate the underlying affine connections on the light cone in momentum space and find that while Pryce connection is metric semi-symmetric, the flat Hawton-Baylis connection is not semi-symmetric. Finally we discuss localizability of photon states localized on closed loops and show that photon states on the circle, both unnormalized improper states and finite norm wave packet smeared over washer-like regions are strictly localized with respect to Hawton-Baylis operators with commuting components and also with respect to the noncommutative Jauch-Piron-Amrein POV measure.</description>

Abstract: We present the design and characterization of individual addressing optics based on a multi-channel acousto-optic modulator (AOM) for trapped ytterbium-171 ions. The design parameters of the individual addressing system were determined based on the tradeoff between the expected crosstalk and the required numerical aperture of the projection objective lens. The target beam diameter and separation were 1.90 $\mu$m and 4.28 $\mu$m, respectively. The individual beams shaped by the projection optics were characterized by an imaging sensor and a field probe ion. The resulting effective beam diameters and separations were approximately 2.34--2.36 $\mu$m and 4.31 $\mu$m, respectively, owing to residual aberration.</description>

      <title>Noncommuting charges' effect on the thermalization of local observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying noncommuting conserved quantities (or `charges') has produced a conceptual puzzle. Recent results suggest that noncommuting charges hinder thermalization in some ways yet promote it in others. To help resolve this puzzle, we demonstrate how noncommuting charges can promote thermalization by reducing the number of local observables that thermalize according to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. We first establish a correspondence between charges and sufficient conditions for local observables not to thermalize. These conditions are known as `dynamical symmetries.' We demonstrate that a corresponding charge exists for each pair of dynamical symmetries a Hamiltonian has. We prove that the reciprocal relationship holds for many charges and Hamiltonians. Using this correspondence, we demonstrate that introducing a new charge into a system can either increase or decrease the number of non-thermalizing local observables. If the new charge commutes with the existing ones, the system's non-thermalizing observables are preserved, and new ones may emerge. Conversely, if it does not commute, the existing non-thermalizing observables will thermalize. We illustrate our results using various models, showing that noncommuting charges eliminate the non-thermalizing dynamics arising from dynamical symmetries.</description>

      <title>Quantum to Classical Neural Network Transfer Learning Applied to Drug Toxicity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toxicity is a roadblock that prevents an inordinate number of drugs from being used in potentially life-saving applications. Deep learning provides a promising solution to finding ideal drug candidates; however, the vastness of chemical space coupled with the underlying $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ matrix multiplication means these efforts quickly become computationally demanding. To remedy this, we present a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for predicting drug toxicity, utilizing a quantum circuit design that mimics classical neural behavior by explicitly calculating matrix products with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Leveraging the Hadamard test for efficient inner product estimation rather than the conventionally used swap test, we reduce the number qubits by half and remove the need for quantum phase estimation. Directly computing matrix products quantum mechanically allows for learnable weights to be transferred from a quantum to a classical device for further training. We apply our framework to the Tox21 dataset and show that it achieves commensurate predictive accuracy to the model's fully classical $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ analog. Additionally, we demonstrate the model continues to learn, without disruption, once transferred to a fully classical architecture. We believe combining the quantum advantage of reduced complexity and the classical advantage of noise-free calculation will pave the way to more scalable machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a notion of operator growth known as Krylov complexity in free and interacting massive scalar quantum field theories in $d$-dimensions at finite temperature. We consider the effects of mass, one-loop self-energy due to perturbative interactions, and finite ultraviolet cutoffs in continuous momentum space. These deformations change the behavior of Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity and induce effects such as the "staggering" of the former into two families, a decrease in the exponential growth rate of the latter, and transitions in their asymptotic behavior. We also discuss the relation between the existence of a mass gap and the property of staggering, and the relation between our ultraviolet cutoffs in continuous theories and lattice theories.</description>

      <title>Inverse Volume Scaling of Finite-Size Error in Periodic Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory is one of the most popular post-Hartree-Fock methods for ab initio molecular quantum chemistry. The finite-size error of the correlation energy in periodic coupled cluster calculations for three-dimensional insulating systems has been observed to satisfy the inverse volume scaling, even in the absence of any correction schemes. This is surprising, as simpler theories that utilize only a subset of the coupled cluster diagrams exhibit much slower decay of the finite-size error, which scales inversely with the length of the system. In this study, we review the current understanding of finite-size error in quantum chemistry methods for periodic systems. We introduce new tools that elucidate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon in the context of coupled cluster doubles calculations. This reconciles some seemingly paradoxical statements related to finite-size scaling. Our findings also show that singularity subtraction can be a powerful method to effectively reduce finite-size errors in practical quantum chemistry calculations for periodic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of quantum complex systems through a potential barrier is often described with transition-state theory, also known as RRKM theory in chemistry. Here we derive the basic formula for transition-state theory based on a generic Hamiltonian as might be constructed in a configuration-interaction basis. Two reservoirs of random Hamiltonians from Gaussian orthogonal ensembles are coupled to intermediate states representing the transition states at a barrier. Under the condition that the decay of the reservoirs to open channels is large, an analytic formula for reaction rates is derived. The transition states act as independent Breit-Wigner resonances which contribute additively to the total transition probability, as is well known for electronic conductance through resonant tunneling states. It is also found that the transition probability is independent of the decay properties of the states in the second reservoir over a wide range of decay widths.</description>

Abstract: We present a family of Floquet circuits that can interpolate between non-interacting qubits, free propagation, generic interacting, and dual-unitary dynamics. We identify the operator entanglement entropy of the two-qubit gate as a good quantitative measure of the interaction strength. We test the persistence of localization in the vicinity of the non-interacting point by probing spectral statistics, decay of autocorrelators, and measuring entanglement growth. The finite-size analysis suggests that the many-body localized regime does not persist in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, our results are compatible with an integrability-breaking phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: By means of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach we investigate a homogeneous dilute weakly interacting Bose gas at finite temperature in vicinity of critical region. A longstanding debate, the shift of critical temperature, is considered and obtained in the universal form $\Delta T_C/T_C^{(0)} = cn_0^{1/3}a_s$ with constants $c$ and $a$. The non-condensate fraction is contributed by quantum fluctuations as well as thermal exitations and can be expressed in sum of three terms. These terms correspond to the quantum fluctuations, thermal fluctuations and both. Indeed, the specific heat capacity and critical exponents are calculated and in excellent agreement with those in previous works and experimental data.</description>

Abstract: One of the methods proposed in the last years for studying non-perturbative gauge theory physics is quantum simulation, where lattice gauge theories are mapped onto quantum devices which can be built in the laboratory, or quantum computers. While being very promising and already showing some experimental results, these methods still face several challenges related to the interface between the technological capabilities and the demands of the simulated models; in particular, one such challenge is the need to simulate infinitely dimensional local Hilbert spaces, describing the gauge fields on the links in the case of compact Lie gauge groups, requiring some truncations and approximations which are not completely understood or controllable in the general case. This work proposes a way to obtain arbitrarily large such local Hilbert spaces by using coarse graining of simple, low dimensional qubit systems, made of components available on most quantum simulation platforms, and thus opening the way of new types of lattice gauge theory quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a stronger fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Eigenstates of Nonintegrable Spin Chains at Infinite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically, for the first time, thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We consider a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most strict sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operator Method in the Steady State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for quantum impurity problems, which directly works in the steady state. The method embraces the well-established infinite matrix product state algorithms with the recently developed GTEMPO method, and benefits from both sides: it obtains numerically exact real-time Green's functions without sampling noises and bath discretization error, it is applicable for any temperature without the sign problem, its computational cost is independent of the transient dynamics and does not scale with the number of baths. We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations. We also study the zero-temperature non-equilibrium steady state of an impurity coupled to two baths with a voltage bias, obtaining consistent particle currents with existing calculations. The method is ideal for studying steady-state quantum transport, and can be readily used as an efficient real-time impurity solver in the dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.</description>
