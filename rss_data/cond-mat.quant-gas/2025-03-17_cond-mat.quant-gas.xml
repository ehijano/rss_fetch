      <title>Scattering resonances and pairing in a Rabi-coupled Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of using a Rabi drive to tune the interactions in an atomic Fermi gas. Specifically, we consider the scenario where two fermion species (spins) are Rabi coupled and interacting with a third uncoupled species. Using an exact calculation within a minimal low-energy model, we derive analytical expressions for the effective scattering length and effective range that characterize the collisions between a Rabi-dressed atom and an atom from the third species. In particular, we find that new scattering resonances emerge in the Rabi-coupled system, which we demonstrate are linked to the existence of hybrid two-body bound states. Furthermore, we show via a generalized Thouless criterion that the scattering properties have a direct impact on the superfluid transitions in the Rabi-coupled Fermi gas. The presence of Rabi-induced resonances thus has implications for the investigation of many-body physics with driven atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-pair superfluidity in a strongly driven Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the paired superfluid phases of a Fermi gas in the presence of a continuous Rabi drive. We focus on the case where two components are strongly coupled by the drive, forming hybrid superpositions, and interacting with an uncoupled third component. Using a generalized Bardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) ansatz, we show that there are two coupled superfluid order parameters, and we obtain the associated free energy and quasiparticle excitation spectrum. We find that we can drive BCS-BCS, BCS-Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and BEC-BEC crossovers purely by varying the detuning of the Rabi drive from the bare transition, with the precise crossover depending on the sign of the underlying interactions between the coupled and uncoupled components. We furthermore identify an exotic excited branch which features both normal to BCS superfluid transitions, as well as a BCS-BEC-BCS crossover. Introducing a generalized Thouless criterion, we show that this behavior is reflected in the critical temperature for superfluidity. Our Rabi-coupled scenario also gives possesses additional thermodynamic properties related to the pseudospin of the coupled components, which provide novel signatures of the state of the many-body system. The Rabi-driven Fermi gas thus emerges as a unique platform for engineering and probing a rich array of multi-band superfluid phases.</description>

      <title>Josephson vortices and persistent current in a double-ring supersolid system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of ultra-cold dipolar atoms in radially coupled, concentric annular traps created by a potential barrier. The non-rotating ground-state phases are investigated across the superfluid-supersolid phase transition, revealing a particle imbalance between the two rings and a preferential density modulation in the outer ring. Near the phase transition on the superfluid side, applying rotation can induce density modulations in either ring, depending on the angular momentum and barrier strength. For low angular momentum, such rotation-induced density modulation forms in the outer ring, while for high angular momentum and weak barriers, it emerges in the inner ring. Rotation can lead to persistent currents and the nucleation of a vortex residing either at the center (central vortex) or at the ring junction (Josephson vortex). Josephson vortices can also form at the junctions of the localized density sites induced by rotation in the inner ring, a behavior that is unique to our system. By switching off the trap and allowing the system to expand, distinct interference patterns emerge, which can be analyzed to identify and distinguish between various vortex configurations, and thus can be observed in current state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Out of Equilibrium Behaviour of Quantum Vortices: A Comparison of Point Vortex Dynamics and Fokker-Planck Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An out of equilibrium two-dimensional superfluid relaxes towards equilibrium via a process of coarsening, driven by the annihilation of vortices with antivortices. Here we present a comparison of two different numerical models of this process, a dissipative point vortex model and Fokker-Planck evolution, across a wide range of initial configurations and levels of dissipation. We find that our dissipative point vortex model is well-approximated by Fokker-Planck evolution only for very low initial energies per vortex, approximately less than -4, when almost all vortices and antivortices are closely bound into dipoles. We observe that the dynamical critical exponent, $z$, in the dissipative point vortex model, undergoes a crossover, from a roughly constant value close to two for energy per vortex approximately greater than -4 to one which depends explicitly on the initial conditions for energy per vortex approximately less than -5.</description>

      <title>A geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A standard description of superfluid helim-4 is based on the concept of two components (superfluid and normal), which leads to the so called two-fluid models. However, as there are no two kinds of atoms in helium-4, the two components can not be separated. Superfluid helium-4 is not a mixture of two components, being rather a single fluid with two motions. Here, we present a geometric one-fluid model of superfluid helium-4, which is based on the Hamiltonian formulation of fluid mechanics. The model is derived from the kinetic theory of excitations and average particle motions. It can be simplified to the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) two-fluid model, where it removes one fitting parameter from the HVBK model, but it also gives extra terms beyond HVBK. Actually, we show that the two-fluid models are problematic in case of higher normal velocities, where the splitting of total momentum to the superfluid and normal component becomes impossible. Finally, we show how vortex line density may be added to the state variables. The one-component model can be seen as a generalization of the two-fluid models that is geometrically consistent, fully compressible, with non-zero superfluid vorticity, and compatible with classical experiments.</description>

      <title>Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Komoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recent advance of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n-$Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo arises for the double occupancy and the compressibility across the Mott transition, as well as the spin structure factor in the Mott insulating state. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing a clear advantage of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model over quantum Monte Carlo methodology in the study of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering hypervolume of two-component fermions in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zero-energy collision of three fermions, two of which are in the spin-down ($\downarrow$) state and one of which is in the spin-up ($\uparrow$) state. Assuming that the two-body and the three-body interactions have a finite range, we find a parameter, $D$, called the three-body scattering hypervolume. We study the three-body wave function asymptotically when three fermions are far apart or one spin-$\uparrow$ (spin-$\downarrow$) fermion and one pair, formed by the other two fermions, are far apart, and derive three asymptotic expansions of the wave function. The three-body scattering hypervolume $D$ appears in the coefficients of such expansions at the order of $B^{-5}$, where $B=\sqrt{(s_1^2+s_2^2+s_3^2)/2}$ is the hyperradius of the triangle formed by the three fermions (we assume that the three fermions have the same mass), and $s_1,s_2,s_3$ are the sides of the triangle. We compute the $T$-matrix element for three such fermions colliding at low energy in terms of $D$ in the absence of two-body interactions. When the interactions are weak, we calculate $D$ approximately using the Born expansion. We also analyze the energy shift of three two-component fermions in a large periodic cube due to $D$ and generalize this result to the many-fermion system. $D$ also determines the three-body recombination rates in two-component Fermi gases, and we calculate the three-body recombination rates in terms of $D$ and the density and temperature of the gas.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Dynamics, Shortcuts to Adiabaticity, and Quantum Quenches in Strongly-Correlated Many-Body Systems: The Time-Dependent Jastrow Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium presents a fundamental challenge due to the vast amount of information it requires. We introduce a generalization of the Jastrow ansatz for time-dependent wavefunctions that offers an efficient and exact description of the time evolution of various strongly correlated systems. Previously known exact solutions are characterized by scale invariance, enforcing self-similar evolution of local correlations, such as the spatial density. However, we demonstrate that a complex-valued time-dependent Jastrow ansatz (TDJA) is not restricted to scale invariance and can describe a broader class of dynamical processes lacking this symmetry. The associated time evolution is equivalent to the implementation of a shortcut to adiabaticity (STA) via counterdiabatic driving along a continuous manifold of quantum states described by a real-valued TDJA, providing a framework for engineering exact STA in strongly correlated many-body quantum systems. We illustrate our findings in systems with inverse-square interactions, such as the Calogero-Sutherland and hyperbolic models, supplemented with pairwise logarithmic interactions, as well as in the long-range Lieb-Liniger model, where bosons experience both contact and Coulomb interactions in one dimension. Our results enable the study of quench dynamics in all these models and serve as a benchmark for numerical and quantum simulations of nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems with continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Splitting and connecting singlets in atomic quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis for digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate on nearest neighbours, many circuits require nonlocal connectivity and necessitate some form of quantum information transport. Yet, connecting distant nodes of a quantum processor still remains challenging, particularly for neutral atoms in optical lattices. Here, we create singlet pairs of two magnetic states of fermionic potassium-40 atoms in an optical lattice and use a bi-directional topological Thouless pump to transport, coherently split, and separate the pairs, as well as to demonstrate interaction between them via tuneable $($swap$)^\alpha$-gate operations. We achieve pumping with a single-shift fidelity of 99.78(3)% over 50 lattice sites and split the pairs within a decoherence-free subspace. Gates are implemented by superexchange interaction, allowing us to produce interwoven atomic singlets. For read-out, we apply a magnetic field gradient, resulting in single- and multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Our work shows avenues to create complex patterns of entanglement and new approaches to quantum processing, sensing, and atom interferometry.</description>
