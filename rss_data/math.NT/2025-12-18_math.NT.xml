      <title>The spin of prime ideals and level-raising of even Galois representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By extending the notion of spin of prime ideals, we show that a short character sum conjecture implies that the set of primes raising the level of a certain even Galois representation has density 2/3, as conjectured by Ramakrishna in 1998.</description>

      <title>Unconditional estimates on the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions with applications to low-lying zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make explicit a result of Selberg on the argument of Dirichlet $L$-functions averaged over non-principal characters modulo a prime $q$. As a corollary, we show for all sufficiently large prime $q$ that the height of the lowest non-trivial zero of the corresponding family of $L$-functions is less than $982\cdot \frac{2\pi}{\log q}$. Here the scaling factor $\frac{2\pi}{\log q}$ is the average spacing between consecutive low-lying zeros with height at most 1, say. We also obtain a lower bound on the proportion of $L$-functions whose first zero lies within a given multiple of the average spacing. These appear to be the first explicit unconditional results of their kinds.</description>

      <title>Isomorphism between Jacobi forms of index $D_{2n+1}$ and elliptic modular forms of level $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three aims in this paper: (i) We show an isomorphism between Jacobi forms of index $D_{2n+1}$ (lattice index) and elliptic modular forms of level $2$. (ii) We give an explicit formula of Fourier coefficients of Jacobi-Eisenstein series of index $D_{2n+1}$. (iii) We construct a holomorphic modular form of weight $3/2$ of level $8$ from the Zagier Eisenstein series $\mathscr{F}$ of weight $3/2$ of level $4$. Moreover, we show that the four functions $E^*_2$, $\eta^3$, $\theta^3$ and $\mathscr{F}$ have essentially the same Hecke eigenvalue $1+p$ for any odd prime $p$, where $E^*_2$ is the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, $\eta$ is the Dedekind eta-function and $\theta$ is the usual theta function. This fact follows from a special case of the isomorphism of (i).
  As an application, we give a formula for a sum of the numbers $r_3(n)$, where $r_3(n)$ is the number of representations of an integer $n \geq 0$ as a sum of $3$ squares.</description>

      <title>Integer triangles with a rational ratio of circumcircle radius to excircle radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding integer triangles with $R/r$ a positive rational, where $R$ and $r$ are the radii of the circumcircle and an excircle, respectively. We show that for general triangles $R/r&gt;1/4$ applies. The equation $R/r=N$ turns out to be related to the elliptic curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ given by $v^2=u^3+2(2N^2+2N-1)u^2-(4N-1)u$. If $N&gt;1/4$ is rational, then the torsion group of $\mathcal{E}_N$ is $\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$ if $N(N+2)$ is a square and $\mathbb Z/6\mathbb Z$ otherwise. We show that a rational triangle with rational ratio $R/r=N$ exists if and only if $N&gt;1/4$ and there exists a rational non-torsion point on the curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ which satisfies a certain condition. Furthermore, we show that the rank of $\mathcal{E}_N$ is positive when $N = m^2 \pm 1&gt;1/4$ for a rational $m$. We also show that on every curve $\mathcal{E}_N$ whose rank is positive, there are infinitely many rational points which lead to infinitely many non-similar integer triangles with $R/r=N$.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of MacMahon Series via Cyclotomic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Gauss sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$: explicit formulas, a duality theorem, and applications to Weil representations and cubic hypersurfaces over $\mathbb{F}_p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, which generalize some of the existing formulas, e.g., Skoruppa and Zagier's (for $n=2$), and Iwaniec and Kowalski's (for arbitrary $n$). We then give four main applications. As the first application, we prove a duality theorem, which relates a sum over a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$ to another sum over the orthogonal complement. This allows us to give explicit formulas for quadratic Gauss partial sums over certain subgroups. As the second application, we give an explicit formula for the coefficients of Weil representations of $\mathrm{Mp}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, which has the advantage, compared to Scheithauer's, Str\"omberg's, and Boylan and Skoruppa's formulas, that it involves neither local data nor limits of theta series. As the third application, we provide an explicit formula for the number of solutions of an arbitrary quadratic congruence in $n$ variables modulo a prime, as well as an efficient formula modulo a general integer. As the final application, we give a uniform formula for the number of solutions of the Diophantine equation $dxyz=Q(x,y,z)$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, where $Q$ is an arbitrary integral quadratic form with some weak restrictions. This generalizes a result of Baragar regarding the Markoff equation. There is also a formula relating Hecke Gauss sums to sums over $\mathbb{Z}^n/c\mathbb{Z}^n$, an explicit formula for Hecke Gauss sums over quadratic fields, and an example of computing a Hecke Gauss sum over a cyclotomic field.</description>

      <title>No exact on average additive complements of squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{N}$ be the set of natural numbers and $\mathcal{S}=\big\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2,\cdots\big\}$ the set of squares. Let $\mathcal{W}$ be an additive complement of $\mathcal{S}$ and $$ f(n)=\#\big\{(w,m^2)\in \mathcal{W}\times \mathcal{S}: n=w+m^2\big\}. $$ It is proved that there is a positive constant $c_{\mathcal{W}}$ (depending at most on $\mathcal{W}$) such that $$ \sum_{n\le N}f(n)-N\ge c_{\mathcal{W}}N $$ for infinitely many positive integers $N$, which makes some progress on a 1993 conjecture of Cilleruelo. As consequences of the this result, we answer negatively a 2001 problem of Ruzsa as well as a 2017 problem of Ben Green.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic sensitivity of cumulant growth in lacunary sums: transcendental versus algebraic ratio limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums $S_n(\omega) := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 \pi a_k \omega)$, $\omega\in[0,1]$, and show that cumulant growth is highly sensitive to the arithmetic structure of the sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of positive integers. In particular, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = \eta &gt; 1$ for some transcendental number $\eta$, we prove that for every $m\in \mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\widetilde{S}_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 \pi a_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \to \infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $\eta$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $\eta = 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $\eta = 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $\eta = (1+\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\to\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Equidistribution on Hyperbolic Surfaces and Arithmetic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wasserstein distance quantifies the distance between two probability measures on a metric space. We prove an analogue of the Berry-Esseen inequality for the Wasserstein distance on a finite area hyperbolic surface. This inequality controls the Wasserstein distance via an average of Weyl sums, which are integrals of Maass cusp forms and Eisenstein series with respect to these probability measures. As applications, we prove upper bounds for the Wasserstein distance for some equidistribution problems on the modular surface $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H}$, namely Duke's theorems on the equidistribution of Heegner points and of closed geodesics and Watson's theorem on the mass equidistribution of Hecke-Maass cusp forms conditionally under the assumption of the generalised Lindelof hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Optimal bounds for sums of non-negative arithmetic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A(s) = \sum_n a_n n^{-s}$ be a Dirichlet series admitting meromorphic continuation to the complex plane. Assume we know the location of the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s| \leq T$, and their residues, for some large constant $T$. It is natural to ask how such finite spectral information may be best used to estimate partial sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n$.
  Here, we prove a sharp, general result on sums $\sum_{n\leq x} a_n n^{-\sigma}$ for $a_n$ non-negative, giving an optimal way to use information on the poles of $A(s)$ with $|\Im s|\leq T$, with no need for zero-free regions. We give not just bounds, but an explicit formula with compact support. Our bounds on $\psi(x)-x$ are, unsurprisingly, better and often simpler than a long list of existing explicit versions of the Prime Number Theorem. We treat the case of $M(x)$ and similar functions in a companion paper.
  Our solution mixes a Fourier-analytic approach in the style of Wiener--Ikehara with contour-shifting, using optimal approximants of Beurling--Selberg type found in (Graham--Vaaler, 1981).</description>

      <title>Abelian structure in approximate groups and Alon's conjecture on Ramsey Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A result of Pyber states that every finite group $G$ contains an abelian subgroup whose order is quasi-polynomially large in $\lvert G\rvert$. We prove a similar result for $K$-approximate subgroups of solvable groups under only modest restrictions on $K$. We show that, if $A$ is a finite $K$-approximate group contained in some solvable group, then some abelian group intersects $A^4$ in at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^{1/6}\lvert A\rvert/\log 2K))$ elements. We also prove a similar result for approximate subgroups of finite groups with no large alternating subquotients. Along the way, we obtain polynomial (instead of quasi-polynomial) bounds for the same statement of approximate subgroups of linear groups.
  We give two applications. Firstly, we consider the conjecture of Alon that every finite group $G$ admits a Cayley graph with clique number and independence number $O(\log\lvert G\rvert)$. Conlon, Fox, Pham, and Yepremyan have recently proven that, for almost all positive integers $N$, every abelian group of order $N$ satisfies Alon's conjecture. Extending their result, we verify Alon's conjecture for all (not necessarily abelian) groups of almost all orders. Secondly, we prove a "local" version of Roth's theorem in (many) non-abelian settings with quasi-polynomial bounds, using the recent breakthroughs of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem and of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni, and Sawhney on the corners problem.</description>

Abstract: A vanishing sum of roots of unity is called minimal if no proper, nonempty sub-sum of it vanishes. This paper classifies all minimal vanishing sums of roots of unity of weight at most 16 by hand, thereby uncovering new phenomena beyond the earlier 1998 classification of Poonen and Rubinstein (SIAM J. Discrete Math.) that went up to weight 12. The paper also develops an algorithm to explore higher weights up to 21, yielding a conjectural extension of the classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a totally real number field. Dasgupta conjectured an explicit $p$-adic analytic formula for the Gross-Stark units of $F$. In a later paper, Dasgupta-Spiess conjectured a cohomological formula for the principal minors and the characteristic polynomial of the Gross regulator matrix associated to a totally odd character of $F$. Dasgupta-Spiess conjectured that these conjectural formulas coincide for the diagonal entries of Gross regulator matrix. In this paper, we prove this conjecture when $F$ is a cubic field.</description>

      <title>Bloch-Beilinson conjectures for Hecke characters and Eisenstein cohomology of Picard surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16435v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider certain families of Hecke characters $\phi$ over a quadratic imaginary field $F$. According to the Bloch-Beilinson conjectures, the order of vanishing of the $L$-function $L(\phi,s)$ at the central point $s=-1$ should be equal to the dimension of the space of extensions of the Tate motive $\mathbb{Q}(1)$ by the motive associated with $\phi$. In this article, we construct candidates for the corresponding extensions of Hodge structures, assuming that the sign of the functional equation of $L(\phi,s)$ is $-1$. This is accomplished through the cohomology of variations of Hodge structures over Picard modular surfaces associated with $F$ and Harder's theory of Eisenstein cohomology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these extensions are naturally realized within certain biextensions. We outline a program to compute the biextension height and utilize it to establish the non-triviality of these extensions.</description>

      <title>On the Root of Unity Ambiguity in a Formula for the Brumer--Stark Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjectural formula for the Brumer--Stark units. Dasgupta--Kakde have shown the formula is correct up to a bounded root of unity. In this paper we resolve the ambiguity in their result. We also remove an assumption from Dasgupta--Kakde's result on the formula.</description>

      <title>Unitary Friedberg--Jacquet periods and anticyclotomic p-adic L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the construction of the $p$-adic $L$-function interpolating unitary Friedberg--Jacquet periods in previous work of the author to include the $p$-adic variation of Maass--Shimura differential operators. In particular, we develop a theory of nearly overconvergent automorphic forms in higher degrees of coherent cohomology for unitary Shimura varieties generalising previous work for modular curves. The construction of this $p$-adic $L$-function can be viewed as a higher-dimensional generalisation of the work of Bertolini--Darmon--Prasanna and Castella--Hsieh, and the inclusion of this extra variable arising from the $p$-adic iteration of differential operators will play a key role in relating values of this $p$-adic $L$-function to $p$-adic regulators of special cycles on unitary Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric motives and the generalized Fermat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the beautiful article [11] Darmon proposed a program to study integral solutions of the generalized Fermat equation $Ax^p+By^q=Cz^r$. In the aforementioned article, Darmon proved many steps of the program, by exhibiting models of hyperelliptic/superelliptic curves lifting what he called ''Frey representations'', Galois representations over a finite field of characteristic $p$. The goal of the present article is to show how hypergeometric motives are more natural objects to obtain the global representations constructed by Darmon, allowing to prove most steps of his program without the need of algebraic models.</description>

      <title>The Hardy--Ramanujan inequality for sifted sets and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Hardy--Ramanujan inequality states that if $\omega(n)$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of a positive integer $n$, then there is an absolute constant $C&gt;0$ such that uniformly for $x\ge2$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, \[\#\{n\le x\colon\omega(n)=k\}\ll\frac{x(\log\log x+C)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!\log x}.\] A myriad of generalizations and variations of this inequality have been discovered. In this paper, we establish a weighted version of this inequality for sifted sets, which generalizes an earlier result of Hal\'asz and implies Timofeev's theorems on shifted primes. We then explore its applications to a variety of intriguing problems, such as large deviations of $\omega$ on subsets of integers, the Erd\H{o}s multiplication table problem, divisors of shifted primes, and the image of the Carmichael $\lambda$-function. Building on the same circle of ideas, we also generalize Troupe's result on the normal order of $\omega(s(n))$ for the sum-of-proper-divisors function $s(n)$, confirming for the first time the weighted version of a special case of a 1992 conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro.</description>

      <title>On irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $c&gt;0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c&gt;3$ and countable for $c&lt;3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable.
  More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</description>

      <title>Explicit Uniform Lower Bounds for the Canonical Height on Elliptic Curves over Abelian Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an explicit lower bound for the N\'eron-Tate height on elliptic curves with complex multiplication, for nontorsion points defined over the maximal abelian extension of a number field. Building on a strategy developed by Amoroso, David, and Zannier, we provide an alternative proof of a theorem originally due to Baker. The novelty in our approach is that it produces a lower bound that is fully explicit and independent of the discriminant of the base field.</description>

Abstract: Using the stable twisted trace formula for the triality automorphism, we show the adjoint lifting (to GL(8)) of cuspidal representations of GL(3) with a discrete series local component. We also describe the possible isobaric decompositions of the resulting automorphic representations on GL(8) and give an application towards Ramanujan bounds for GL(3).</description>

      <title>On the Wedderburn decomposition of the total ring of quotients of certain Iwasawa algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G\simeq H\rtimes\Gamma$ be the semidirect product of a finite group $H$ and $\Gamma\simeq\mathbb Z_p$. Let $F/\mathbb Q_p$ be a finite extension with ring of integers $\mathcal O_F$. Then the total ring of quotients $\mathcal Q^F(\mathcal G)$ of the completed group ring $\mathcal O_{F}[[\mathcal G]]$ is a semisimple ring. We determine its Wedderburn decomposition under a ramification hypothesis by relating it to the Wedderburn decomposition of the group ring $F[H]$.</description>

      <title>The Kodaira dimension of even-dimensional ball quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, up to scaling, there exist only finitely many isometry classes of Hermitian lattices over $O_E$ of signature $(1,n)$ that admit ball quotients of non-general type, where $n&gt;12$ is even and $E=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-D})$ for an odd discriminant $-D&lt;-3$. Furthermore, we show that even-dimensional ball quotients, associated with arithmetic subgroups of $\mathrm{U}(1,n)$ defined over $E$, are always of general type if $n &gt; 207$, or $n&gt;12$ and $D&gt;2557$. To establish these results, we construct a nontrivial full-level cusp form of weight $n$ on the $n$-dimensional complex ball. A key ingredient in our proof is the use of Arthur's multiplicity formula from the theory of automorphic representations.</description>

We generalize results of the first author on elliptic surfaces and employ constructions used by Desjardins and the third author to prove density of rational points. Our results are the first on the Hilbert property for minimal del Pezzo surfaces of degree one without a conic fibration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$ be an integer, $K_0$ a perfect field such that $char(K_0)$ does not divide $d$, $n &gt; d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $C_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(C_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $C_{f,d} $. We identify $C_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(C_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $C_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(C_{f,d})$).
  We say that an integer $m&gt;1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $C_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$.
  Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable).
  In the present paper we prove the following.
  If $n&lt;m&lt;2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$, then either $d|m$ or $m \equiv n \bmod d$.
  If either $char(K_0)=0$ or $K_0$ in infinite and $char(K_0)&gt;n$, then $d\cdot [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1)\cdot [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$.
  If $char(K_0)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d&lt;n$.
  If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K_0)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$. (The case when $n \le m \le 3(n-1)/2$ was done earlier by E.V. Flynn.)</description>

      <title>Elliptic modular graph forms, equivariant iterated integrals and single-valued elliptic polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy expansion of genus-one string amplitudes produces infinite families of non-holomorphic modular forms after each step of integrating over a point on the torus worldsheet which are known as elliptic modular graph forms (eMGFs). We solve the differential equations of eMGFs depending on a single point $z$ and the modular parameter $\tau$ via iterated integrals over holomorphic modular forms which individually transform inhomogeneously under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$. Suitable generating series of these iterated integrals over $\tau$, their complex conjugates and single-valued multiple zeta values (svMZVs) are combined to attain equivariant transformations under ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ such that their components are modular forms.
  Our generating series of equivariant iterated integrals for eMGFs is related to elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) through a gauge transform of the flat Calaque-Enriquez-Etingof connection. By converting iterated $\tau$-integrals to iterated integrals over points on a torus, we arrive at an explicit construction of single-valued eMPLs where all the monodromies in the points cancel. Each single-valued eMPL depending on a single point $z$ is found to be a finite combination of meromorphic eMPLs, their complex conjugates, svMZVs and equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. Our generating series determines the latter two admixtures via so-called zeta generators and Tsunogai derivations which act on the two generators $x$, $y$ of a free Lie algebra and where the coefficients of words in $x,y$ define the single-valued eMPLs.</description>
