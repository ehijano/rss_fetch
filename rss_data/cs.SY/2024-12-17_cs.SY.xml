      <title>Invariant Kalman Filter for Relative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an invariant Kalman filter for estimating the relative trajectories between two dynamic systems. Invariant Kalman filters formulate the estimation error in terms of the group operation, ensuring that the error state does not depend on the current state estimate - a property referred to as state trajectory independence. This is particularly advantageous in extended Kalman filters, as it makes the propagation of the error covariance robust to large estimation errors. In this work, we construct invariant Kalman filters to the trajectory of one system relative to another. Specifically, we show that if the relative dynamics can be described solely by relative state variables, they automatically satisfy state trajectory independence, allowing for the development of an invariant Kalman filter. The corresponding relative invariant Kalman filter is formulated in an abstract fashion and is demonstrated numerically for the attitude dynamics of a rigid body.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Scalable Multiagent Spacecraft Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of spacecraft in orbit continues to increase, it is becoming more challenging for human operators to manage each mission. As a result, autonomous control methods are needed to reduce this burden on operators. One method of autonomous control is Reinforcement Learning (RL), which has proven to have great success across a variety of complex tasks. For missions with multiple controlled spacecraft, or agents, it is critical for the agents to communicate and have knowledge of each other, where this information is typically given to the Neural Network Controller (NNC) as an input observation. As the number of spacecraft used for the mission increases or decreases, rather than modifying the size of the observation, this paper develops a scalable observation space that uses a constant observation size to give information on all of the other agents. This approach is similar to a lidar sensor, where determines ranges of other objects in the environment. This observation space is applied to a spacecraft inspection task, where RL is used to train multiple deputy spacecraft to cooperate and inspect a passive chief spacecraft. It is expected that the scalable observation space will allow the agents to learn to complete the task more efficiently compared to a baseline solution where no information is communicated between agents.</description>

      <title>Prescribing Decision Conservativeness in Two-Stage Power Markets: A Distributionally Robust End-to-End Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end framework for calibrating wind power forecast models to minimize operational costs in two-stage power markets, where the first stage involves a distributionally robust optimal power flow (DR-OPF) model. Unlike traditional methods that adjust forecast parameters and uncertainty quantification (UQ) separately, this framework jointly optimizes both the forecast model parameters and the decision conservativeness, which determines the size of the ambiguity set in the DR-OPF model. The framework aligns UQ with actual uncertainty realizations by directly optimizing downstream operational costs, a process referred to as cost-oriented calibration. The calibration is achieved using a gradient descent approach. To enable efficient differentiation, the DR-OPF problem is reformulated into a convex form, and the Envelope Theorem is leveraged to simplify gradient derivation in the two-stage setting. Additionally, the framework supports distributed implementation, enhancing data privacy and reducing computational overhead. By proactively calibrating forecast parameters and prescribing optimal decision conservativeness, the framework significantly enhances cost efficiency and reliability in power system operations. Numerical experiments on an IEEE 5-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Tensor Decomposition for Learning Mixtures of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MLDS) from input-output data. This mixture setting allows us to leverage observations from related dynamical systems to improve the estimation of individual models. Building on spectral methods for mixtures of linear regressions, we propose a moment-based estimator that uses tensor decomposition to estimate the impulse response of component models of the mixture. The estimator improves upon existing tensor decomposition approaches for MLDS by utilizing the entire length of the observed trajectories. We provide sample complexity bounds for estimating MLDS in the presence of noise, in terms of both $N$ (number of trajectories) and $T$ (trajectory length), and demonstrate the performance of our estimator through simulations.</description>

      <title>An Active Parameter Learning Approach to The Identification of Safe Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identification of safe regions in the environment of an autonomous system. The environment is divided into a finite collections of Voronoi cells, with each cell having a representative, the Voronoi center. The extent to which each region is considered to be safe by an oracle is captured through a trust distribution. The trust placed by the oracle conditioned on the region is modeled through a Bernoulli distribution whose the parameter depends on the region. The parameters are unknown to the system. However, if the agent were to visit a given region, it will receive a binary valued random response from the oracle on whether the oracle trusts the region or not. The objective is to design a path for the agent where, by traversing through the centers of the cells, the agent is eventually able to label each cell safe or unsafe. To this end, we formulate an active parameter learning problem with the objective of minimizing visits or stays in potentially unsafe regions. The active learning problem is formulated as a finite horizon stochastic control problem where the cost function is derived utilizing the large deviations principle (LDP). The challenges associated with a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem are analyzed. Subsequently, the optimization problem is relaxed to obtain single-step optimization problems for which closed form solution is obtained. Using the solution, we propose an algorithm for the active learning of the parameters. A relationship between the trust distributions and the label of a cell is defined and subsequently a classification algorithm is proposed to identify the safe regions. We prove that the algorithm identifies the safe regions with finite number of visits to unsafe regions. We demonstrate the algorithm through an example.</description>

      <title>$L_1$-Based Adaptive Identification with Saturated Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that saturated output observations are prevalent in various practical systems and that the $\ell_1$-norm is more robust than the $\ell_2$-norm-based parameter estimation. Unfortunately, adaptive identification based on both saturated observations and the $\ell_1$-optimization turns out to be a challenging nonlinear problem, and has rarely been explored in the literature. Motivated by this and the need to fit with the $\ell_1$-based index of prediction accuracy in, e.g., judicial sentencing prediction problems, we propose a two-step weighted $\ell_1$-based adaptive identification algorithm. Under certain excitation conditions much weaker than the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition, we will establish the global convergence of both the parameter estimators and the adaptive predictors. It is worth noting that our results do not rely on the widely used independent and identically distributed (iid) assumptions on the system signals, and thus do not exclude applications to feedback control systems. We will demonstrate the advantages of our proposed new adaptive algorithm over the existing $\ell_2$-based ones, through both a numerical example and a real-data-based sentencing prediction problem.</description>

      <title>Impact of Trip Distance Distribution Time Dependency and Aggregation Levels in Bathtub Models -- A Comparative Simulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bathtub models are used to study urban traffic within a certain area. They do not require to take into account the detailed network topology. The emergence of different bathtub models has raised the question of which model can provide more robust and accurate results under different demand scenarios and network properties. This paper presents a comparative simulation analysis of the accumulation-based model and trip-based models under static and dynamic trip distance distribution (TDD) scenarios. Network accumulation was used to validate and compare the performance of the bathtub models with results from the macroscopic traffic simulation with dynamic traffic assignment. Three networks were built to explore the effect of network properties on the accuracy of bathtub models. Two are from the network of Delft, the Netherlands, and one is a reference toy network. The findings show that the time dependency of TDD can increase the errors in bathtub models. Using TDD in different aggregation levels can significantly influence the performance of bathtub models during demand transition periods. The state transition speed of networks is also found to be influential. Future research could explore the effects of dynamic TDD under congested situations and develop enhanced bathtub models that can better account for different network state transition speeds.</description>

      <title>Inertia-aware Unit Commitment and Remuneration Methods for Decarbonized Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To maintain frequency stability in decarbonized power systems, inertia services from synchronous generators (SGs) and inverter-based resources must be procured. However, designing an inertia-aware system operation poses significant challenges in considering the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and adopting a remuneration method for inertia provision due to SG commitment variables. To address this research gap, we renovate the inertia-aware chance constraints unit commitment model by incorporating time-coupling constraints for SGs and joint chance constraints for RES uncertainty. We investigate remuneration methods for inertia provision, including uplift, marginal pricing (MP), approximated convex hull pricing (aCHP), and average incremental cost pricing (AIP), applying these to the renovated model. Numerical experiments show that the model enhances frequency stability during a contingency. Among the remuneration methods, only aCHP guarantees revenue adequacy without requiring uplift while maximizing economic welfare. However, the MP requires the highest level of uplift to adequately compensate generation costs, as the price function fails to account for inertia provision.</description>

      <title>Automated Driving with Evolution Capability: A Reinforcement Learning Method with Monotonic Performance Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution to enable evolutionary automated driving. However, the conventional RL method is always concerned with risk performance. The updated policy may not obtain a performance enhancement, even leading to performance deterioration. To address this challenge, this research proposes a High Confidence Policy Improvement Reinforcement Learning-based (HCPI-RL) planner. It is intended to achieve the monotonic evolution of automated driving. A novel RL policy update paradigm is designed to enable the newly learned policy performance consistently surpass that of previous policies, which is deemed as monotonic performance enhancement. Hence, the proposed HCPI-RL planner has the following features: i) Evolutionary automated driving with monotonic performance enhancement; ii) With the capability of handling scenarios with emergency; iii) With enhanced decision-making optimality. Results demonstrate that the proposed HCPI-RL planner enhances the policy return by 44.7% in emergent cut-in scenarios, 108.2% in emergent braking scenarios, and 64.4% in daily cruising scenarios, compared to the PPO planner. Adopting the proposed planner, automated driving efficiency is enhanced by 19.2% compared to the PPO planner, and by 30.7% compared to the rule-based planner.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-based reinforcement learning for distributed control with stability guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Lyapunov-based reinforcement learning method for distributed control of nonlinear systems comprising interacting subsystems with guaranteed closed-loop stability. Specifically, we conduct a detailed stability analysis and derive sufficient conditions that ensure closed-loop stability under a model-free distributed control scheme based on the Lyapunov theorem. The Lyapunov-based conditions are leveraged to guide the design of local reinforcement learning control policies for each subsystem. The local controllers only exchange scalar-valued information during the training phase, yet they do not need to communicate once the training is completed and the controllers are implemented online. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are evaluated using a benchmark chemical process that contains two reactors and one separator.</description>

      <title>Economic MPC with an Online Reference Trajectory for Battery Scheduling Considering Demand Charge Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monthly demand charges form a significant portion of the electric bill for microgrids with variable renewable energy generation. A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 h rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Interharmonic Power: A New Concept for Power System Oscillation Source Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system oscillations are a significant concern for system operators, a problem that has grown due to the interconnection of inverter-based resources. To address this issue, various methods have been proposed to locate the sources of oscillations, which is essential for effective mitigation actions. A common characteristic of these methods is that they rely on phasor representation of oscillation phenomena. This paper takes a different approach by examining the actual voltage and current waveforms underlying the phasors. It is found that the presence of interharmonic components is both the necessary and sufficient condition for phasor oscillations. Moreover, the generation and propagation of interharmonic powers are identified as the true culprits behind power system oscillations and oscillatory instability. Based on these insights, two new methods are developed for locating oscillation sources: one for measurement-based monitoring applications and another for model-based system studies. These findings are validated through four field data-based and one simulation-based case studies.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation with Quantized Measurements and Communication over Markovian Switching Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed parameter estimation in stochastic dynamic systems with quantized measurements, constrained by quantized communication and Markovian switching directed topologies. To enable accurate recovery of the original signal from quantized communication signal, a persistent excitation-compliant linear compression encoding method is introduced.Leveraging this encoding, this paper proposes an estimation-fusion type quantized distributed identification algorithm under a stochastic approximation framework. The algorithm operates in two phases: first, it estimates neighboring estimates using quantized communication information, then it creates a fusion estimate by combining these estimates through a consensus-based distributed stochastic approximation approach.To tackle the difficulty caused by the coupling between these two estimates, two combined Lyapunov functions are constructed to analyze the convergence performance. Specifically, the mean-square convergence of the estimates is established under a conditional expectation-type cooperative excitation condition and the union topology containing a spanning tree. Besides, the convergence rate is derived to match the step size's order under suitable step-size coefficients. Furthermore, the impact of communication uncertainties including stochastic communication noise and Markov-switching rate is analyzed on the convergence rate. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical findings and highlights the joint effect of sensors under quantized communication.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of heterogeneous configurations in distributed systems presents significant challenges in ensuring stability and efficiency. Misconfigurations, driven by complex parameter interdependencies, can lead to critical failures. Group Testing (GT) has been leveraged to expedite troubleshooting by reducing the number of tests, as demonstrated by methods like ZebraConf. However, ZebraConf's binary-splitting strategy suffers from sequential testing, limited handling of parameter interdependencies, and susceptibility to errors such as noise and dilution. We propose Ba-ZebraConf, a novel three-dimensional Bayesian framework that addresses these limitations. It integrates (1) Bayesian Group Testing (BGT), which employs probabilistic lattice models and the Bayesian Halving Algorithm (BHA) to dynamically refine testing strategies, prioritizing high-informative parameters and adapting to real-time outcomes. Bayesian optimization tunes hyperparameters, such as pool sizes and test thresholds, to maximize testing efficiency. (2) Bayesian Optimization (BO) to automate hyperparameter tuning for test efficiency, and (3) Bayesian Risk Refinement (BRR) to iteratively capture parameter interdependencies and improve classification accuracy. Ba-ZebraConf adapts to noisy environments, captures parameter interdependencies, and scales effectively for large configuration spaces. Experimental results show that Ba-ZebraConf reduces test counts and execution time by 67% compared to ZebraConf while achieving 0% false positives and false negatives. These results establish Ba-ZebraConf as a robust and scalable solution for troubleshooting heterogeneous distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Under Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework to synthesize robust strategies for discrete-time nonlinear systems with random disturbances that are unknown, against temporal logic specifications. The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Output Tracking Control with Reference Model System Uncertainties: Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops some extensions to the work of [1] which studied the continuous-time adaptive output tracking control schemes with the reference output signal generated from an unknown reference model system. The presented extensions include adaptive control schemes with reference model system uncertainties for single-input single-output (SISO) discrete-time systems and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) discrete-time, continuous-time and feedback linearizable systems as well. To deal with such reference model system uncertainties, the adaptive controller structures are expanded to include a parametrized estimator of the equivalent reference input signal, to ensure a completely parametrized error system with a known regressor vector, suitable for stable adaptive controller parameter update law design.</description>

      <title>AEPHORA: AI/ML-Based Energy-Efficient Proactive Handover and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) scenarios require high-speed, low-latency, and ultra-reliable communication services, particularly for applications such as autonomous driving and in-vehicle infotainment. Dense heterogeneous cellular networks, which incorporate both macro and micro base stations, can effectively address these demands. However, they introduce more frequent handovers and higher energy consumption. Proactive handover (PHO) mechanisms can significantly reduce handover delays and failure rates caused by frequent handovers, especially with the mobility prediction capabilities enhanced by artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies. Nonetheless, the energy-efficient joint optimization of PHO and resource allocation (RA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose the AEPHORA framework, which leverages AI/ML-based predictions of vehicular mobility to jointly optimize PHO and RA decisions. This framework aims to minimize the average system transmission power while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints on communication delay and reliability. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AEPHORA framework in balancing energy efficiency with QoS requirements in high-demand V2X environments.</description>

      <title>Dual Unscented Kalman Filter Architecture for Sensor Fusion in Water Networks Leak Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage in water systems results in significant daily water losses, degrading service quality, increasing costs, and aggravating environmental problems. Most leak localization methods rely solely on pressure data, missing valuable information from other sensor types. This article proposes a hydraulic state estimation methodology based on a dual Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) approach, which enhances the estimation of both nodal hydraulic heads, critical in localization tasks, and pipe flows, useful for operational purposes. The approach enables the fusion of different sensor types, such as pressure, flow and demand meters. The strategy is evaluated in well-known open source case studies, namely Modena and L-TOWN, showing improvements over other state-of-the-art estimation approaches in terms of interpolation accuracy, as well as more precise leak localization performance in L-TOWN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a long-duration autonomy approach for the control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating in a transportation network. In particular, we focus on the performance of CAVs at traffic bottlenecks, including roundabouts, merging roadways, and intersections. We take a principled approach based on optimal control, and derive a reactive controller with guarantees on safety, performance, and energy efficiency. We guarantee safety through high order control barrier functions (HOCBFs), which we ``lift'' to first order CBFs using time-optimal motion primitives. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in simulation and compare it to an optimal control-based approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of a two-level battery charger for electric vehicles, focusing on modeling, simulation, and performance evaluation. The proposed charger topology employs two switches operating complementarily, along with essential components such as inductors, capacitors, and batteries. Detailed modeling in steady-state and dynamic regimes reveals the influence of nonlinearities, particularly switch and energy storage element characteristics, on charger efficiency and performance. Efficiency calculations highlight the significance of precise modeling and control strategies. Controller synthesis involves designing a robust proportional-integral compensator for effective battery charging current regulation. Analysis of non-idealities underscores the need for accurate component sizing and control strategies. The findings provide valuable insights for optimizing charger design and control, with implications for enhancing electric vehicle performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Behavioral Aggregation: A Case Study on the Nordic Power Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies the Probabilistic Behavioral Tuning (ProBeTune) framework to transient power grid simulations to address challenges posed by increasing grid complexity. ProBeTune offers a probabilistic approach to model aggregation, using a behavioral distance measure to quantify and minimize discrepancies between a full-scale system and a simplified model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProBeTune on the Nordic5 (N5) test case, a model representing the Nordic power grid with complex nodal dynamics and a high share of RESs. We substantially reduce the complexity of the dynamics by tuning the system to align with a reduced swing-equation model. We confirm the validity of the swing equation with tailored controllers and parameter distributions for capturing the essential dynamics of the Nordic region. This reduction could allow interconnected systems like the Central European power grid to treat the Nordic grid as a single dynamic actor, facilitating more manageable stability assessments. The findings lay the groundwork for future research on applying ProBeTune to microgrids and other complex sub-systems, aiming to enhance scalability and accuracy in power grid modeling amidst rising complexity.</description>

      <title>Development of a Compact High-Voltage Functional Electrical Stimulation Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report details the design and development of a compact high-voltage functional electrical stimulation (FES) device. Unlike conventional FES systems, the proposed design prioritizes user comfort by leveraging rapid switching times to effectively activate muscles while minimizing stimulation of pain receptors. The device is equipped with a high compliance voltage of up to 135 V, enabling its use across various muscle groups and accommodating users with differing skin conductance levels. At the core of the system is a switched capacitor (SC) stimulator, which facilitates fast switching, and a flyback converter that steps up the battery voltage. The design exclusively utilizes off-the-shelf components, significantly reducing prototyping costs. Initially, a large testing board was developed to evaluate the performance of the SC stimulator in comparison with conventional H-bridge-based current-regulated stimulators. Subsequently, a compact, three-board PCB design was created to enable battery-powered operation, making it suitable for wearable applications. The proposed design methodology is broadly applicable to a wide range of neural rehabilitation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of personalized, interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest a personalized and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Personalized And Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with personalized multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods. We also release our sequential rater dataset and simulated user-rater interactions to support future research in personalized, multi-turn T2I generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic hybrid systems are dynamic systems that undergo both random continuous-time flows and random discrete jumps. Depending on how randomness is introduced into the continuous dynamics, discrete transitions, or both, stochastic hybrid systems exhibit distinct characteristics. This paper investigates the role of uncertainties in the interplay between continuous flows and discrete jumps by studying probability density propagation. Specifically, we formulate stochastic Koopman/Frobenius-Perron operators for three types of one-dimensional stochastic hybrid systems to uncover their unique dynamic characteristics and verify them using Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field games and controls involve guiding the behavior of large populations of interacting agents, where each individual's influence on the group is negligible but collectively impacts overall dynamics. Hybrid systems integrate continuous dynamics with discrete transitions, effectively modeling the complex interplay between continuous flows and instantaneous jumps in a unified framework. This paper formulates mean field game and control strategies for switching hybrid systems and proposes computational methods to solve the resulting integro-partial differential equation. This approach enables scalable, decentralized decision-making in large-scale switching systems, which is illustrated through numerical examples in an emergency evacuation scenario with sudden changes in the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Error Estimation and Stopping Criteria for Krylov-Based Model Order Reduction in Acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the frequency range of interest, finite element-based modeling of acoustic problems leads to dynamical systems with very high dimensional state spaces. As these models can mostly be described with second order linear dynamical system with sparse matrices, mathematical model order reduction provides an interesting possibility to speed up the simulation process. In this work, we tackle the question of finding an optimal order for the reduced system, given a desired accuracy. To do so, we revisit a heuristic error estimator based on the difference of two reduced models from two consecutive Krylov iterations. We perform a mathematical analysis of the estimator and show that the difference of two consecutive reduced models does provide a sufficiently accurate estimation for the true model reduction error. This claim is supported by numerical experiments on two acoustic models. We briefly discuss its feasibility as a stopping criterion for Krylov-based model order reduction.</description>

      <title>Certainty-Equivalence Model Predictive Control: Stability, Performance, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model-based controller design, particularly in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is effective in managing uncertainties, its inherent conservatism often makes it less desirable in practice. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which relies on a nominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and reduced online computational requirements. Contrary to the existing analysis where MPC has access to the true model, this paper investigates certainty-equivalence MPC for uncertain nonlinear systems with input constraints; here the uncertainty stems from parametric discrepancies between the true model and the nominal model. The primary contributions of the paper are twofold. First, a novel perturbation analysis of the MPC value function is provided, which avoids the common assumption of Lipschitz continuity for cost functions and has broader applicability to topics such as value function approximation, online model adaptation in MPC, and performance-driven MPC design. Besides, a sufficient stability condition and performance analysis of CE-MPC are derived, where the latter quantifies the suboptimality of CE-MPC relative to the infinite-horizon optimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide valuable insights into how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect stability and performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to linear quadratic control, and the competitive ratio is derived, serving as the first ratio-like performance bound for predictive control of uncertain linear systems with constraints.</description>

Abstract: The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial tasks and environmental manipulation is increasingly desired. This can be demonstrated via art tasks. This paper presents the development of Magnasketch, capable of translating image inputs into art on a magnetic drawing board via a Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor. Optimal trajectories were generated using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation newly incorporating magnetic force dynamics. A Z-compliant magnetic drawing apparatus was designed for the quadrotor. Experimental results of the novel controller tested against the existing Position High Level Commander showed comparable performance. Although slightly outperformed in terms of error, with average errors of 3.9 cm, 4.4 cm, and 0.5 cm in x, y, and z respectively, the Magnasketch controller produced smoother drawings with the added benefit of full state control.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Based Multi-Agent Task Scheduling for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) framework is a crucial foundation for future networks, where satellites and aerial nodes assist in computational task offloading. The low-altitude economy, leveraging the flexibility and multifunctionality of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in SAGIN, holds significant potential for development in areas such as communication and sensing. However, effective coordination is needed to streamline information exchange and enable efficient system resource allocation. In this paper, we propose a Clustering-based Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (CMADDPG) algorithm to address the multi-UAV cooperative task scheduling challenges in SAGIN. The CMADDPG algorithm leverages dynamic UAV clustering to partition UAVs into clusters, each managed by a Cluster Head (CH) UAV, facilitating a distributed-centralized control approach. Within each cluster, UAVs delegate offloading decisions to the CH UAV, reducing intra-cluster communication costs and decision conflicts, thereby enhancing task scheduling efficiency. Additionally, by employing a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, the algorithm leverages the extensive coverage of satellites to achieve centralized training and distributed execution of multi-agent tasks, while maximizing overall system profit through optimized task offloading decision-making. Simulation results reveal that the CMADDPG algorithm effectively optimizes resource allocation, minimizes queue delays, maintains balanced load distribution, and surpasses existing methods by achieving at least a 25\% improvement in system profit, showcasing its robustness and adaptability across diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improving Numerical Stability and Accuracy in Partitioned Methods with Algebraic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The partitioned approach for the numerical integration of power system differential algebraic equations faces inherent numerical stability challenges due to delays between the computation of state and algebraic variables. Such delays can compromise solution accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale system simulations. We present an $O(h^2)$-accurate prediction scheme for algebraic variables based on forward and backward difference formulas, applied before the correction step of numerical integration. The scheme improves the numerical stability of the partitioned approach while maintaining computational efficiency. Through numerical simulations on a lightly damped single machine infinite bus system and a large-scale 140-bus network, we demonstrate that the proposed method, when combined with variable time-stepping, significantly enhances the numerical stability, solution accuracy, and computational performance of the simulation. Results show reduced step rejections, fewer nonlinear solver iterations, and improved accuracy compared to conventional approaches, making the method particularly valuable for large-scale power system dynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Shape Learning of Complex Objects Using Gaussian Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed learning of a complex object for multiple networked robots based on distributed optimization and kernel-based support vector machine. In order to overcome a fundamental limitation of polynomial kernels assumed in our antecessor, we employ Gaussian kernel as a kernel function for classification. The Gaussian kernel prohibits the robots to share the function through a finite number of equality constraints due to its infinite dimensionality of the function space. We thus reformulate the optimization problem assuming that the target function space is identified with the space spanned by the bases associated with not the data but a finite number of grid points. The above relaxation is shown to allow the robots to share the function by a finite number of equality constraints. We finally demonstrate the present approach through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Stability Condition for Online Feedback Optimization without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) is a control approach to drive a dynamical plant to an optimal steady state. By interconnecting optimization algorithms with real-time plant measurements, OFO provides all the benefits of feedback control, yet without requiring exact knowledge of plant dynamics for computing a setpoint. On the downside, existing stability guarantees for OFO require the controller to evolve on a sufficiently slower timescale than the plant, possibly affecting transient performance and responsiveness to disturbances. In this paper, we prove that, under suitable conditions, OFO ensures stability without any timescale separation. In particular, the condition we propose is independent of the time constant of the plant, hence it is scaling-invariant. Our analysis leverages a composite Lyapunov function, which is the $\max$ of plant-related and controller-related components. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Reliably Learn to Trim Multiparametric Quadratic Programs via Constraint Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a wide range of applications, we are required to rapidly solve a sequence of convex multiparametric quadratic programs (mp-QPs) on resource-limited hardwares. This is a nontrivial task and has been an active topic for decades in control and optimization communities. Observe that the main computational cost of existing solution algorithms lies in addressing many linear inequality constraints, though their majority are redundant and removing them will not change the optimal solution. This work learns from the results of previously solved mp-QP(s), based on which we propose novel methods to reliably trim (unsolved) mp-QPs via constraint removal, and the trimmed mp-QPs can be much cheaper to solve. Then, we extend to trim mp-QPs of model predictive control (MPC) whose parameter vectors are sampled from linear systems. Importantly, both online and offline solved mp-QPs can be utilized to adaptively trim mp-QPs in the closed-loop system. We show that the number of linear inequalities in the trimmed mp-QP of MPC decreases to zero in a finite timestep, which also can be reduced by increasing offline computation. Finally, simulations are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of our trimming method in removing redundant constraints.</description>

      <title>Neural Port-Hamiltonian Differential Algebraic Equations for Compositional Learning of Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop compositional learning algorithms for coupled dynamical systems. While deep learning has proven effective at modeling complex relationships from data, compositional couplings between system components typically introduce algebraic constraints on state variables, posing challenges to many existing data-driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems. Towards developing deep learning models for constrained dynamical systems, we introduce neural port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equations (N-PHDAEs), which use neural networks to parametrize unknown terms in both the differential and algebraic components of a port-Hamiltonian DAE. To train these models, we propose an algorithm that uses automatic differentiation to perform index reduction, automatically transforming the neural DAE into an equivalent system of neural ordinary differential equations (N-ODEs), for which established model inference and backpropagation methods exist. The proposed compositional modeling framework and learning algorithms may be applied broadly to learn control-oriented models of dynamical systems in a variety of application areas, however, in this work, we focus on their application to the modeling of electrical networks. Experiments simulating the dynamics of nonlinear circuits exemplify the benefits of our approach: the proposed N-PHDAE model achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy and constraint satisfaction when compared to a baseline N-ODE over long prediction time horizons. We also validate the compositional capabilities of our approach through experiments on a simulated D.C. microgrid: we train individual N-PHDAE models for separate grid components, before coupling them to accurately predict the behavior of larger-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Wireless Environmental Information Theory: A New Paradigm towards 6G Online and Proactive Environment Intelligence Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The channel is one of the five critical components of a communication system, and its ergodic capacity is based on all realizations of statistic channel model. This statistical paradigm has successfully guided the design of mobile communication systems from 1G to 5G. However, this approach relies on offline channel measurements in specific environments, and the system passively adapts to new environments, resulting in deviation from the optimal performance. With the pursuit of higher capacity and data rate of 6G, especially facing the ubiquitous environments, there is an urgent need for a new paradigm to combat the randomness of channel, i.e., more proactive and online manner. Motivated by this, we propose an environment intelligence communication (EIC) based on wireless environmental information theory (WEIT) for 6G. The proposed EIC architecture is composed of three steps: Firstly, wireless environmental information (WEI) is acquired using sensing techniques. Then, leveraging WEI and channel data, AI techniques are employed to predict channel fading, thereby mitigating channel uncertainty. Thirdly, the communication system autonomously determines the optimal air-interface transmission strategy based on real-time channel predictions, enabling intelligent interaction with the physical environment. To make this attractive paradigm shift from theory to practice, we answer three key problems to establish WEIT for the first time. How should WEI be defined? Can it be quantified? Does it hold the same properties as statistical communication information? Furthermore, EIC aided by WEI (EIC-WEI) is validated across multiple air-interface tasks, including CSI prediction, beam prediction, and radio resource management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EIC-WEI significantly outperforms the statistical paradigm in decreasing overhead and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Avoidance of Ellipsoidal Obstacles with Model Predictive Control for Mobile Robots and Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications of mobile robots, collision avoidance is of critical importance. Typically, global motion planning in constrained environments is addressed through high-level control schemes. However, additionally integrating local collision avoidance into robot motion control offers significant advantages. For instance, it reduces the reliance on heuristics and conservatism that can arise from a two-stage approach separating local collision avoidance and control. Moreover, using model predictive control (MPC), a robot's full potential can be harnessed by considering jointly local collision avoidance, the robot's dynamics, and actuation constraints. In this context, the present paper focuses on obstacle avoidance for wheeled mobile robots, where both the robot's and obstacles' occupied volumes are modeled as ellipsoids. To this end, a computationally efficient overlap test, that works for arbitrary ellipsoids, is conducted and novelly integrated into the MPC framework. We propose a particularly efficient implementation tailored to robots moving in the plane. The functionality of the proposed obstacle-avoiding MPC is demonstrated for two exemplary types of kinematics by means of simulations. A hardware experiment using a real-world wheeled mobile robot shows transferability to reality and real-time applicability. The general computational approach to ellipsoidal obstacle avoidance can also be applied to other robotic systems and vehicles as well as three-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time System for Scheduling and Managing UAV Delivery in Urban</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As urban logistics demand continues to grow, UAV delivery has become a key solution to improve delivery efficiency, reduce traffic congestion, and lower logistics costs. However, to fully leverage the potential of UAV delivery networks, efficient swarm scheduling and management are crucial. In this paper, we propose a real-time scheduling and management system based on the ``Airport-Unloading Station" model, aiming to bridge the gap between high-level scheduling algorithms and low-level execution systems. This system, acting as middleware, accurately translates the requirements from the scheduling layer into specific execution instructions, ensuring that the scheduling algorithms perform effectively in real-world environments. Additionally, we implement three collaborative scheduling schemes involving autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ground staff to further optimize overall delivery efficiency. Through extensive experiments, this study demonstrates the rationality and feasibility of the proposed management system, providing practical solution for the commercial application of UAVs delivery in urban.

      <title>On the SDP Relaxation of Direct Torque Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper formulates a semidefinite programming relaxation for a long horizon direct-torque finite-control-set model predictive control problem. In parallel with this relaxation, a conventional branch-and-bound algorithm tailored for the original problem, but with an iteration limit to restrict its computational burden, is also solved. An input sequence candidate is extracted from the solution of the semidefinite program in the lifted space. This sequence is then compared with the so-called early-stopping branch-and-bound solution, and the best of the two is applied in a receding horizon fashion. In simulated case studies, the proposed approach exhibits significant improvements in torque transients, as the branch-and-bound alone struggles to find a meaningful solution due to the imposed limit.</description>

      <title>Hardware-in-the-loop Simulation Testbed for Geomagnetic Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geomagnetic navigation leverages the ubiquitous Earth's magnetic signals to navigate missions, without dependence on GPS services or pre-stored geographic maps. It has drawn increasing attention and is promising particularly for long-range navigation into unexplored areas. Current geomagnetic navigation studies are still in the early stages with simulations and computational validations, without concrete efforts to develop cost-friendly test platforms that can empower deployment and experimental analysis of the developed approaches. This paper presents a hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed to support geomagnetic navigation experimentation. Our testbed is dedicated to synthesizing geomagnetic field environment for the navigation. We develop the software in the testbed to simulate the dynamics of the navigation environment, and we build the hardware to generate the physical magnetic field, which follows and aligns with the simulated environment. The testbed aims to provide controllable magnetic field that can be used to experiment with geomagnetic navigation in labs, thus avoiding real and expensive navigation experiments, e.g., in the ocean, for validating navigation prototypes. We build the testbed with off-the-shelf hardware in an unshielded environment to reduce cost. We also develop the field generation control and hardware parameter optimization for quality magnetic field generation. We conduct a detailed performance analysis to show the quality of the field generation by the testbed, and we report the experimental results on performance indicators, including accuracy, uniformity, stability, and convergence of the generated field towards the target geomagnetic environment.</description>

      <title>A Digital twin for Diesel Engines: Operator-infused PINNs with Transfer Learning for Engine Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving diesel engine efficiency and emission reduction have been critical research topics. Recent government regulations have shifted this focus to another important area related to engine health and performance monitoring. Although the advancements in the use of deep learning methods for system monitoring have shown promising results in this direction, designing efficient methods suitable for field systems remains an open research challenge. The objective of this study is to develop a computationally efficient neural network-based approach for identifying unknown parameters of a mean value diesel engine model to facilitate physics-based health monitoring and maintenance forecasting. We propose a hybrid method combining physics informed neural networks, PINNs, and a deep neural operator, DeepONet to predict unknown parameters and gas flow dynamics in a diesel engine. The operator network predicts independent actuator dynamics learnt through offline training, thereby reducing the PINNs online computational cost. To address PINNs need for retraining with changing input scenarios, we propose two transfer learning (TL) strategies. The first strategy involves multi-stage transfer learning for parameter identification. While this method is computationally efficient as compared to online PINN training, improvements are required to meet field requirements. The second TL strategy focuses solely on training the output weights and biases of a subset of multi-head networks pretrained on a larger dataset, substantially reducing computation time during online prediction. We also evaluate our model for epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by incorporating dropout in pretrained networks and Gaussian noise in the training dataset. This strategy offers a tailored, computationally inexpensive, and physics-based approach for parameter identification in diesel engine sub systems.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Control of Tendon-Driven Continuum Robots in Large Deflections Using the Cosserat Rod Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study on the backstepping control of tendon-driven continuum robots for large deflections using the Cosserat rod model. Continuum robots are known for their flexibility and adaptability, making them suitable for various applications. However, modeling and controlling them pose challenges due to their nonlinear dynamics. To model their dynamics, the Cosserat rod method is employed to account for significant deflections, and a numerical solution method is developed to solve the resulting partial differential equations. Previous studies on controlling tendon-driven continuum robots using Cosserat rod theory focused on sliding mode control and were not tested for large deflections, lacking experimental validation. In this paper, backstepping control is proposed as an alternative to sliding mode control for achieving a significant bending. The numerical results are validated through experiments in this study, demonstrating that the proposed backstepping control approach is a promising solution for achieving large deflections with smoother trajectories, reduced settling time, and lower overshoot. Furthermore, two scenarios involving external forces and disturbances were introduced to further highlight the robustness of the backstepping control approach.</description>

      <title>Revelations: A Decidable Class of POMDPs with Omega-Regular Objectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) form a prominent model for uncertainty in sequential decision making. We are interested in constructing algorithms with theoretical guarantees to determine whether the agent has a strategy ensuring a given specification with probability 1. This well-studied problem is known to be undecidable already for very simple omega-regular objectives, because of the difficulty of reasoning on uncertain events. We introduce a revelation mechanism which restricts information loss by requiring that almost surely the agent has eventually full information of the current state. Our main technical results are to construct exact algorithms for two classes of POMDPs called weakly and strongly revealing. Importantly, the decidable cases reduce to the analysis of a finite belief-support Markov decision process. This yields a conceptually simple and exact algorithm for a large class of POMDPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and leverage them to schedule energy dispatch ahead of time. However, forecast models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the operational value of the forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the loss function with the overall operation cost function, thereby achieving reduced operation costs. The forecast model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. Additionally, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear regarding the forecast model output, and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used statistical quality-oriented point forecasting methods, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operation costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach is more computationally efficient than traditional two-stage stochastic programs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Functional Estimation: Functional Detectability and Full Information Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the design of functional estimators, i.e., approaches to compute an estimate of a nonlinear function of the state of a general nonlinear dynamical system subject to process noise based on noisy output measurements. To this end, we introduce a novel functional detectability notion in the form of incremental input/output-to-output stability ($\delta$-IOOS). We show that $\delta$-IOOS is a necessary condition for the existence of a functional estimator satisfying an input-to-output type stability property. Additionally, we prove that a system is functional detectable if and only if it admits a corresponding $\delta$-IOOS Lyapunov function. Furthermore, $\delta$-IOOS is shown to be a sufficient condition for the design of a stable functional estimator by introducing the design of a full information estimation (FIE) approach for functional estimation. Together, we present a unified framework to study functional estimation with a detectability condition, which is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a stable functional estimator, and a corresponding functional estimator design. The practical need for and applicability of the proposed functional estimator design is illustrated with a numerical example of a power system.</description>

      <title>On Approximate Opacity of Stochastic Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an important class of information-flow security property called opacity for stochastic control systems. Opacity captures whether a system's secret behavior (a subset of the system's behavior that is considered to be critical) can be kept from outside observers. Existing works on opacity for control systems only provide a binary characterization of the system's security level by determining whether the system is opaque or not. In this work, we introduce a quantifiable measure of opacity that considers the likelihood of satisfying opacity for stochastic control systems modeled as general Markov decision processes (gMDPs). We also propose verification methods tailored to the new notions of opacity for finite gMDPs by using value iteration techniques. Then, a new notion called approximate opacity-preserving stochastic simulation relation is proposed, which captures the distance between two systems' behaviors in terms of preserving opacity. Based on this new system relation, we show that one can verify opacity for stochastic control systems using their abstractions (modeled as finite gMDPs). We also discuss how to construct such abstractions for a class of gMDPs under certain stability conditions.</description>

      <title>Using Dynamic Safety Margins as Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic approach to design control barrier functions (CBFs) for arbitrary state and input constraints using tools from the reference governor literature. In particular, it is shown that dynamic safety margins (DSMs) are CBFs for an augmented system obtained by concatenating the state and a virtual reference. The proposed approach is agnostic to the relative degree and can handle multiple state and input constraints using the control-sharing property of CBFs. The construction of CBFs using Lyapunov-based DSMs is then investigated in further detail. Numerical simulations show that the method outperforms existing DSM-based approaches, while also guaranteeing safety and persistent feasibility of the associated optimization program.</description>

      <title>Improving Sequential Market Coordination via Value-oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) brings huge uncertainty into the electricity markets. The current deterministic clearing approach in the day-ahead (DA) market, where RESs participate based on expected production, has been criticized for causing a lack of coordination between the DA and real-time (RT) markets, leading to high overall operating costs. Previous works indicate that improving day-ahead RES entering quantities can significantly mitigate the drawbacks of deterministic clearing. In this work, we propose using a trained forecasting model, referred to as value-oriented forecasting, to determine RES Improved Entering Quantities (RIEQ) more efficiently during the operational phase. Unlike traditional models that minimize statistical forecasting errors, our approach trains model parameters to minimize the expected overall operating costs across both DA and RT markets. We derive the exact form of the loss function used for training, which becomes piecewise linear when market clearing is modeled by linear programs. Additionally, we provide the analytical gradient of the loss function with respect to the forecast, enabling an efficient training strategy. Numerical studies demonstrate that our forecasts significantly reduce overall operating costs for deterministic market clearing compared to conventional forecasts based on expected RES production.</description>

      <title>AI-focused HPC Data Centers Can Provide More Power Grid Flexibility and at Lower Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models, requires energy-demanding high-performance computing (HPC) data centers, which poses a significant burden on power system capacity. Scheduling data center computing jobs to manage power demand can alleviate network stress with minimal infrastructure investment and contribute to fast time-scale power system balancing. This study, for the first time, comprehensively analyzes the capability and cost of grid flexibility provision by GPU-heavy AI-focused HPC data centers, along with a comparison with CPU-heavy general-purpose HPC data centers traditionally used for scientific computing. A data center flexibility cost model is proposed that accounts for the value of computing. Using real-world computing traces from 7 AI-focused HPC data centers and 7 general-purpose HPC data centers, along with computing prices from 3 cloud platforms, we find that AI-focused HPC data centers can offer greater flexibility at 50% lower cost compared to general-purpose HPC data centers for a range of power system services. By comparing the cost to flexibility market prices, we illustrate the financial profitability of flexibility provision for AI-focused HPC data centers. Finally, our flexibility and cost estimates can be scaled using parameters of other data centers through algebraic operations, avoiding the need for re-optimization.</description>

      <title>Active Target Tracking Using Bearing-only Measurements With Gaussian Process Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the tracking problem of a target with the partially unknown motion model by an active agent with bearing-only measurements using Gaussian process learning. To address this problem, a learning-planning-control framework is proposed. First, to learn and predict the target motion under mild assumptions, a Gaussian-process-based scheme is proposed, and a probabilistic uniform prediction error bound can be rigorously proved. Second, by analyzing the data dependence of the posterior covariance, we obtain an optimal relative trajectory to achieve efficient sampling. Third, to realize efficient learning, a controller to track the planned path is proposed based on the learned target motion, which can provide guaranteed tracking performance. Theoretical analysis is conducted to prove the the given probabilistic error bounds. Numerical examples and comparison with other typical methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Modelling, design and control of middle-size tilt-rotor quadrotor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the mathematical modelling and 3D design of a tilt-rotor quadrotor aircraft. The aircraft is a VTOL design and has capacity for one pilot. The design incorporates a part manual part automatic computerised flight control system and hybrid powertrain providing energy to eight ducted contrarotating propellers. Analysis of controllability was performed using the parameters derived from the developed model for the take-off phase of flight. The aircraft is of a lightweight design and is intended to fill a niche in the aviation market with potential for civilian and military applications. The aircraft has multiple redundancies in the instance of propeller failure. The viability of a hybrid powerplant is explored by combining industry standard gas turbine technology with electrical motor and battery systems. The combination of these systems results in a safe, versatile aircraft that can operate at different levels of automation depending on environmental factors or phase of flight. Simulation confirms the design of the aircraft.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Control of Subsonic Missile for Air-to-Air Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsonic missiles play an important role in modern air-to-air combat scenarios - utilized by the F-35 Lightning II - but require complex Guidance, Navigation and Control systems to manoeuvre with 30G's of acceleration to intercept successfully. Challenges with mathematically modelling and controlling such a dynamic system must be addressed, high frequency noise rejected, and actuator delay compensated for. This paper aims to investigate the control systems necessary for interception. It also proposes a subsonic design utilizing literature and prior research, suggests aerodynamic derivatives, and analyses a designed 2D reduced pitch autopilot control system response against performances. The pitch autopilot model contains an optimized PID controller, 2nd order actuator, lead compensator and Kalman Filter, that rejects time varying disturbances and high frequency noise expected during flight. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method through reduction in rise time (21%), settle time (10%), and highlighted its high frequency deficiency with respect to the compensator integration. The actuator delay of 100ms has been negated by the augmented compensator autopilot controller so that it exceeds system performance requirements (1) &amp; (3). However, (2) is not satisfied as 370% overshoot exists. This research confirms the importance of a lead compensator in missile GNC systems and furthers control design application through a specific configuration. Future research should build upon methods and models presented to construct and test an interception scenario.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Quantum Neural Network for Probabilistic Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of renewable energy and load demand requires efficient and accurate solutions for probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF). Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which combine quantum computing and machine learning, offer computational advantages in approximating OPF by effectively handling high-dimensional data. However, adversaries with access to non-private OPF solutions can potentially infer sensitive load demand patterns, raising significant privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving QNN model for probabilistic OPF approximation. By incorporating Gaussian noise into the training process, the learning algorithm achieves ($\varepsilon, \delta$)-differential privacy with theoretical guarantees. Moreover, we develop a strongly entangled quantum state to enhance the nonlinearity expressiveness of the QNN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully prevents privacy leakage without compromising the statistical properties of probabilistic OPF. Moreover, compared to classical private neural networks, the QNN reduces the number of parameters by 90% while achieving significantly higher accuracy and greater stability.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator Feedback for a First-Order PIDE with Spatially-Varying State Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.</description>

      <title>On the Robotic Uncertainty of Fully Autonomous Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent transportation research highlights the potential of autonomous vehicles (AV) to improve traffic flow mobility as they are able to maintain smaller car-following distances. However, as a unique class of ground robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception and control modules, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over mobility in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper presents an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous reciprocity between traffic safety and mobility that arises from AVs' robotic uncertainties. Using both realistic car-following data and a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM), the stochastic car-following distance is derived as a key parameter, enabling analysis of single-lane capacity and the collision probability. A semi-Markov process is then employed to model the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting collision-inclusive capacity, representing expected lane capacity under stationary conditions, serves as the primary performance metric for fully autonomous traffic. The analytical results are further utilized to investigate the impacts of critical parameters in AV and roadway designs on traffic performance, as well as the properties of optimal speed and headway under mobility-targeted or safety-dominated management objectives. Extensions to scenarios involving multiple non-independent collisions or multi-lane traffic scenarios are also discussed, which demonstrates the robustness of the theoretical results and their practical applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization-Based System Identification and Moving Horizon Estimation Using Low-Cost Sensors for a Miniature Car-Like Robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an open-source miniature car-like robot with low-cost sensing and a pipeline for optimization-based system identification, state estimation, and control. The overall robotics platform comes at a cost of less than \$\,700 and thus significantly simplifies the verification of advanced algorithms in a realistic setting. We present a modified bicycle model with Pacejka tire forces to model the dynamics of the considered all-wheel drive vehicle and to prevent singularities of the model at low velocities. Furthermore, we provide an optimization-based system identification approach and a moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme. In extensive hardware experiments, we show that the presented system identification approach results in a model with high prediction accuracy, while the MHE results in accurate state estimates. Finally, the overall closed-loop system is shown to perform well even in the presence of sensor failure for limited time intervals. All hardware, firmware, and control and estimation software is released under a BSD 2-clause license to promote widespread adoption and collaboration within the community.</description>
