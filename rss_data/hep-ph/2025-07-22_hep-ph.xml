      <title>A quantum algorithm for the n-gluon MHV scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for computing the n-gluon maximally helicity violating (MHV) tree-level scattering amplitude. We revisit a newly proposed method for unitarisation of non-unitary operations and present how this implementation can be used to create quantum gates responsible for the color and kinematic factors of the gluon scattering amplitude. As a proof-of-concept, we detail the full conceptual algorithm that yields the squared amplitude and implement the corresponding building blocks on simulated noiseless quantum circuits for n = 4 to analyze its performance. The algorithm is found to perform well with parameter optimizations, suggesting it to be a good candidate for implementing on quantum computers also for higher multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Spectral Surgery in a Heat Bath: a finite-temperature guide to particle production for phenomenologists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the effects of finite temperature and density (FTD) on particle properties is essential for understanding phenomena within and beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we present a simplified framework for calculating particle production rates at FTD without resorting to a full thermal field theory calculation. We do so by relating the imaginary part of a particle's $n$-loop finite temperature self energy, which defines its in-medium damping rate, to a sum of thermally weighted tree-level vacuum rates. Such a mapping results in novel "interference" contributions to particle production which have no vacuum analog and which have been relatively overlooked in the phenomenology literature. These interference terms are known to regulate collinear and infrared divergences that arise when calculating interaction rates in a medium. We demonstrate the impact of these corrections with two toy models and find that properly accounting for these interference terms can alter particle production by an $O(1)$ amount. We additionally compare the size of these corrections to the thermal mass corrections often studied in the literature, finding the sizes of these contributions to be of similar order.</description>

      <title>Universal parameters of the $\Lambda(1380)$, the $\Lambda(1405)$ and their isospin partners from a combined analysis of Lattice QCD and experimental results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of lattice and experimental data on negative-strangeness meson-baryon scattering using a large set of variations of the theoretical framework based on the Chiral Unitary Approach. For the former, the L\"uscher formalism is utilized taking into account all pertinent coupled-channel effects. Through this, systematic uncertainties related to data scarcity, potential ambiguities, and possible framework dependence are quantified for the first time. The implementation of information criteria and other statistical tools is discussed. As a final result we provide pole positions for isoscalar resonances at the physical and lattice points including statistical and systematic uncertainties. Predictions for the isovector states are also provided showing large uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Dark matter pair absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of atomic transitions to light dark matter pair absorption. Unlike scattering, where only a fraction of the dark matter energy is deposited, pair absorption processes absorb the full mass, and are therefore capable of constraining far lighter dark matter. Spin-flip and fine structure transitions are able to constrain electroweak scale axial-vector couplings for bosonic dark matter with $\mu\mathrm{eV}$ to eV masses, whilst principal quantum number transitions are able to set similar constraints on bosonic dark matter with scalar couplings. Unfortunately, pair absorption is largely insensitive to light fermionic DM due its necessarily tiny density at low masses. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of pair absorption to the cosmic neutrino background, and find that spin-flip transitions can set constraints on the overdensity parameter of $\eta_\nu \lesssim 10^9$ for neutrino masses $m_\nu \lesssim 1\,\mathrm{meV}$, around a hundred times stronger than existing constraints.</description>

      <title>The electroweak precision constraints of the 2HDM+S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2HDM+S is the singlet extension of the Two-Higgs-Doublets Model (2HDM). The singlet field and its mixing with the 2HDM Higgs sector lead to new contributions to the electroweak precision observables, in particular, the oblique parameters. In this paper, we identify five benchmark cases, where at most one mixing angle is nonzero and analyze the 95% C.L. allowed parameter space by the oblique parameters. In the alignment limit of the 2HDM, we find that other than the usual mass relations of $m_H\sim m_{H^\pm}$ or $m_A\sim m_{H^\pm}$, electroweak precision measurements also impose an upper limit on the neutral Higgs masses. In the cases with nonzero singlet mixing with the 2HDM Higgses $H$ or $A$, we find approximate mass relations of $c^2_{\alpha_{HS}} m_{H} + s^2_{\alpha_{HS}}m_{h_S} = m_{H^\pm}$ or $c^2_{\alpha_{AS}} m_{A} + s^2_{\alpha_{AS}}m_{A_S} = m_{H^\pm}$. Those relations are universal to the 2HDM+S models, with or without further symmetry assumption. We also study the non-alignment limit of the 2HDM+S, which typically has tighter constraints on the masses and mixing angles. At the end, we examine the complementarity between the electroweak precision analyses and the Higgs coupling precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <title>Excitonic contributions to dark matter-electron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine whether excitonic effects affect predictions of dark matter (DM)-electron scattering rates by calculating the energy- and momentum-dependent energy-loss function, including electron-hole interaction excitonic effects, for the dark-matter scintillating detector materials GaAs and NaI. By comparing our results using the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the framework of many-body perturbation theory, which explicitly includes excitonic effects, with those using the quasiparticle random-phase approximation, which includes only electron-electron interaction and crystal local-field effects, we find that excitonic effects in NaI significantly increase the predicted scattering rate at low energy and as a result improve the cross-section sensitivity considering a realistic background. In contrast, the predicted scattering rate and the DM-electron scattering cross-section for GaAs are minimally affected by excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>Goldstone bosons across thermal phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature has a significant effect on the properties of quantum field theories (QFTs) with a spontaneously broken symmetry, in particular on the massless Goldstone bosons that exist in the vacuum state. It has recently been shown using lattice calculations for a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ complex scalar field theory that the Goldstone mode persists even when the symmetry is restored above the critical temperature $T_{c}$, and has the properties of a screened massless excitation, a so-called thermoparticle. In this work, we continue the investigation of this theory by determining explicitly how the Goldstone mode evolves as the temperature is increased both below and above $T_{c}$. We find that the two phases of the theory are entirely characterised by the thermal dissipative effects experienced by the Goldstone mode, with the broken and symmetry-restored phases associated with weak and strong damping, respectively. These findings are consistent with the non-perturbative constraints imposed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, and provide a new way in which to characterise thermal phase transitions in QFTs.</description>

      <title>Susceptibilities and Taylor coefficients of magnetic QCD from perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the coefficients $c_2(T,B)$ and $c_4(T,B)$ of the Taylor expansion for the pressure in powers of $\mu_B/T$ in the presence of a large magnetic field within perturbative QCD at finite temperature and baryon density up to two-loops for $N_f=3$ flavors with physical quark masses. We also present results for the excess of pressure, baryon density and baryon number susceptibility as functions of $\mu_B$, as well as susceptibilities as functions of the temperature in the $\{ \mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S \}$ basis. Our results can be directly compared to recent lattice QCD data. Even though current lattice results do not overlap with its region of validity, perturbative results seem to be compatible with those obtained on the lattice for large temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Supersymmetric Standard Model, combined with a special Exotic Invariant, yields a new kind of SUSY mass splitting (E6)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic Invariants, with Lorentz invariance, have been found in the BRS cohomology of SUSY in 3+1 dimensions. Until recently, it was generally accepted that no such objects could exist. It is shown here that the Supersymmetric Standard Model (``the SSM'') can be coupled to a special Exotic Invariant to form a new model, which we call the Exotic Model (``the XM'') . This Exotic Model continues to generate the usual Vacuum Expectation Value (``VEV'') that breaks gauge symmetry from SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1) to SU(3) X U(1) But now, from the same VEV, the Exotic Model also generates SUSY violating mass splitting of the neutral ``ZX'' sector at tree level. This is possible because the Exotic Model changes the algebra of SUSY. This ``ZX'' sector is flavour neutral, which might explain the suppression of flavour changing neutral currents observed in experiments. The Exotic Model is governed by a very restrictive Master Equation, so there should be a very small number of parameters in it.</description>

      <title>On the Impossibility of Obtaining Time-Independent, Three-Dimensional, Spherically-Symmetric Densities of Confined Systems of Relativistically Moving Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical definition of probability, the uncertainty principle and Poincare invariance provide strong basic restrictions on the ability to define spatial densities associated with form factors describing the properties of confined systems of relativistically moving constituents. Despite this, many papers ignore one or more of these restrictions. Here I show how to obtain time-independent, two-dimensional densities that are consistent with the stated restrictions. This is done using the light-front, infinite momentum frame formalism. Two-dimensional density interpretations of the axial-vector form factor and all three gravitational form factors are obtained. Additionally, an expression of a two-dimensional mass density related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor is obtained. I also show that all known methods for finding three-dimensional densities: using the Breit frame, Abel transformations, Wigner distributions and spherically-symmetric wave packets with vanishing spatial extent violate the basic restrictions in different manners. Furthermore, the use of the latter leads to densities that vanish almost everywhere in space as time increases from an initial value.</description>

      <title>Comments on Exploring Quantum Statistics for Dirac and Majorana Neutrinos using Spinor-Helicity technique (arXiv:2507.07180 [hep-ph])</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give our comments on Ref. [1](arXiv:2507.07180) which critiques our idea of exploring quantum statistics to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos proposed in some of our earlier works. We show that the ad-hoc symmetrization of the Dirac case amplitude square advocated in Eqs. (16) and (35) of [1], have no physical basis and it leads to violation of lepton number in the the standard model. Therefore, we consider this symmetrization by hand as incorrect and misleading. Moreover, we show that it is even unnecessary for the proof of pDMCT in context of final states containing a neutrino and antineutrino pair.</description>

      <title>Determination of Fragmentation Functions from Charge Asymmetries in Hadron Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for extracting non-singlet (NS) fragmentation functions (FFs) of light charged hadrons from charge asymmetries measured in hadron fragmentation, using data from both single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering processes. We determine the NS FFs for pions and kaons at next-to-next-to-leading order in Quantum Chromodynamics, including a comprehensive uncertainty analysis. The extracted FFs reveal a scaling index of about 0.7 at large momentum fractions and low energy scales, a strangeness suppression factor of about 0.5, and universality in fragmentation of light mesons. Our findings provide a valuable benchmark for testing non-perturbative QCD models and Monte Carlo event generators, and serve as crucial input for future electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Horizon of Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistent discrepancy between the experimental measurement and the Standard Model (SM) prediction of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)_\mu$ remains one of the most intriguing hints of physics beyond the SM. A well-motivated explanation involves a light $Z'$ gauge boson associated with a broken $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry. Such a boson not only resolves the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, but also induces resonant interactions between high-energy cosmic neutrinos and the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), potentially shaping the observable neutrino flux at Earth. In this work, we explore the implications of such interactions for the cosmic propagation of high-energy neutrinos. We compute the optical depth for neutrino attenuation via $Z'$-mediated scattering, accounting for neutrino masses, hierarchies, and thermal distributions. We delineate the regions in $(m_{Z'}, m_\nu)$ space where the optical depth exceeds unity, defining a "neutrino cosmic horizon" beyond which high-energy neutrinos are significantly attenuated. We confront these results with the parameter space required to simultaneously explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly and ease the Hubble tension via an additional contribution to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}} \simeq 0.2-0.5$. Our analysis reveals a consistent region in parameter space where all three phenomena - $(g-2)_\mu$, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and high-energy neutrino attenuation-can be explained by the same light mediator. These findings motivate future searches for spectral features in IceCube and its next-generation successors as indirect probes of new physics in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon from gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon by analyzing its gravitational form factors (GFFs) within the framework of QCD sum rules. These form factors encode rich information about the internal structure of hadrons and offer deep insights into the dynamics that govern their stability. The spin-3/2 nature of the $\Omega^-$ baryon manifests in its gravitational form factors as intricate multipole structures, which encapsulate higher-order deformations and demonstrate the influence of intrinsic spin on internal dynamics. We extract the GFFs of the $\Omega^-$ baryon and apply their specific multipole combinations, gravitational multipole form factors (GMFFs), to quantify key mechanical observables-including energy density, angular momentum, pressure and shear force distributions, mass and mechanical radii, and D-terms-associated with different multipole orders. Notably, this work provides the first determination of several of these observables, such as the mechanical radii and the quadrupole contributions to the pressure and shear force distributions. Our analysis shows that the quadrupole contributions to the mechanical properties are generally subdominant compared to those from the monopole component. We further investigate the mechanical stability of the $\Omega^-$ through a multipole analysis of its internal force distributions. These results enhance our understanding of the mechanical structure of spin-3/2 hadrons and provide useful benchmarks for future theoretical and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of the $\phi$-$^{4}\mathrm{He}$ scattering length from near-threshold $\phi$ photoproduction on helium-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-independent extraction of the phi-helium-4 scattering length from near-threshold phi photoproduction on helium-4, based on LEPS Collaboration data for the coherent process gamma plus helium-4 to phi plus helium-4, and the Vector Meson Dominance framework. Assuming an energy-independent differential cross section, we extract the absolute value of the phi-helium-4 scattering length, |alpha_phiHe4| = (4.19 +/- 0.07) x 10^-4 fm, from a fit at the threshold t_thr. This value is orders of magnitude smaller than those for phi-nucleon and phi-deuteron scattering lengths, indicating an inverse dependence of |alpha_VN| on the target nucleus mass. Our results provide new insight into the phi-nucleus interaction, supporting the notion of weak phi-nucleus coupling. We further explore the dependence of |alpha_VN| on the vector meson mass, the target atom mass, and the threshold energy. An approximate exponential suppression of |alpha_VN| is observed with increasing vector meson mass or target atom mass, indicating that heavier vector mesons or heavier target nuclei exhibit weaker couplings in vector meson-nucleus interactions.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of scalar particles assisted by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore the phenomenology of scalar particles within Beyond Standard Model frameworks, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance sensitivity and discovery potential at current and future collider experiments, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Specifically, we study scalar extensions of the Standard Model such as the Two Higgs Doublet Model Type-III (2HDM-III) and the Froggatt-Nielsen Flavon model. We perform a detailed collider analysis focusing on charged Higgs boson pair production within the 2HDM-III, examining final states involving muons, neutrinos and quark jets. Our studies identify parameter regions consistent with recent experimental anomalies reported by ATLAS collaboration, particularly in charged Higgs decays involving charm-bottom quark transitions, and suggest concrete scenarios for achieving statistically significant signals of 5$\sigma$ at future luminosities. In the context of the Flavon model, we analyse potential signatures of a new scalar called Flavon decaying into a Higgs boson and a pair of bottom quarks, followed by the channels where the Higgs decays into a pair of bottom quarks or a pair of photons. Additionally, we analyse Lepton-Flavour-Violating processes, both of them achieving discovery level significances of up to $5\sigma$ at the HL-LHC. Using multivariate analysis techniques, specifically Boosted Decision Trees, we demonstrate a significant improvement in signal discrimination. Throughout this thesis, ML methodologies have been integral, notably enhancing the signal from background separation and significantly improving the robustness of phenomenological predictions. The methods and analyses presented here contribute to clarifying the flavour structure mysteries of the SM and offer actionable targets for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Leading vector coupling in baryon semileptonic decays in large-$N_c$ chiral perturbation theory revisited: Extension to decuplet baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading vector coupling defined in the semileptonic decay of a baryon is revisited in the framework of large-$N_c$ baryon chiral perturbation. Aspects of $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking are taken into account in two ways: Explicitly through perturbative symmetry breaking and implicitly through the integrals occurring in the one-loop corrections. The analysis of perturbative breaking is performed by using flavor projection operators which are exceptionally helpful in understanding previously unidentified issues. The approach is extended to theoretically evaluate the leading vector coupling in the transition $\Omega^-\to {\Xi^*}^0$. A fitting procedure to data reveals that second-order symmetry breaking corrections, while small, can have a significant impact on the evaluation of the baryon vector coupling, potentially increasing its overall strength due to the involved interplay of both explicit and implicit contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning allows unfolding high-dimensional spaces without binning at the LHC. The new SPINUP method extracts the unfolded distribution based on a neural network encoding the forward mapping, making it independent of the prior from the simulated training data. It is made efficient through neural importance sampling, and ensembling can be used to estimate the effect of information loss in the forward process. We showcase SPINUP for unfolding detector effects on jet substructure observables and for unfolding to parton level of associated Higgs and single-top production.</description>

      <title>Is the shear induced spin polarization non-dissipative?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shear-induced polarization plays a crucial role in understanding the local polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons. A key puzzle is whether the shear-induced polarization is non-dissipative or not. In this work, we analyzed the shear-induced polarization and the anomalous Hall effects using the entropy flow and H-theorem introduced from quantum (chiral) kinetic theory. While the shear-induced polarization and the anomalous Hall effect do not directly contribute to the entropy production rate, the perturbations associated with the shear tensor lead to an increase in entropy, similar to the role of the shear tensor in classical kinetic theory. We also examined these effects within the framework of linear response theory using Zubarev's approach. The analysis of time-reversal transformation on the spin current in coordinate space suggests that shear-induced polarization violates time-reversal symmetry and, therefore, should vanish. However, a similar analysis of the Wigner function in phase space does not impose any additional constraints on shear-induced polarization, allowing it to persist in phase space as expected. This discussion indicates that time-reversal analysis in coordinate space alone may not be sufficient to determine whether an effect is dissipative. Furthermore, our analysis based on Zubarev's approach suggests that these effects may indeed possess a dissipative nature. These findings highlight the limitations of the current theoretical framework in fully characterizing the dissipative properties of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing square transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Axion-Like Particles from Tau Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated examples of light, weakly coupled particles in theories beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we study long-lived ALPs coupled exclusively to leptons in the mass range between $2 m_e$ and $m_\tau - m_e$. For anarchic flavor structure the leptophilic ALP production in tau decays or from ALP-tau bremsstrahlung is enhanced thanks to derivative couplings of the ALP and can surpass production from electron and muon channels, especially for ALPs heavier than $m_\mu$. Using past data from high-energy fixed-target experiments such as CHARM and BEBC we place new constraints on the ALP decay constant $f_a$, reaching scales as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^8)$~GeV in lepton-flavor-violating channels and $f_a \sim \mathcal{O}(10^2)$~GeV in lepton-flavor-conserving ones. We also present projections for the event-rate sensitivity of current and future detectors to ALPs produced at the Fermilab Main Injector, the CERN SPS, and in the forward direction of the LHC. We show that SHiP will be sensitive to $f_a$ values that are over an order of magnitude above the existing constraints.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations and Bell nonlocality in $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ pair production from $e^+e^-$ collisions with a thrust cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production from $e^+e^-$ annihilation, providing the theoretical predictions for the Belle II experiment. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we perform the first resummation of large logarithms for the longitudinal ($C_{LL}$) and transverse ($C_{TT}$) spin correlations for events with a cut on the thrust variable. Our calculation achieves next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and incorporates the determination of polarized fragmenting jet functions. This framework provides robust predictions with significantly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to fixed-order parton model approaches. Furthermore, we establish a direct mapping between the experimentally accessible spin correlation, $C_{TT}$, and a testable CHSH-Bell inequality. This result reframes $C_{TT}$ as a quantitative probe of quantum decoherence, providing a novel tool to measure the degree of parton-level entanglement that survives the fragmentation and hadronization process.</description>

      <title>Probing HZZ Interactions through Single Production of Higgs Boson at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The associated production of a Higgs boson with a Z boson in the collisions of electron and positron beams at Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) have been studied. Here, the Z boson decays into dileptons, while the Higgs boson decays to all possible channels, mostly to the b\bar{b}. The collisions provides a clean and powerful channel to probe the (HZZ) coupling at future lepton colliders. Following the event generation, the analysis is performed using the recoil mass method, which allows model-independent reconstruction of the Higgs boson depending on the kinematics of the final-state leptons. This method enables precise identification of the Higgs signal peak independent of its decay mode and significantly reduces systematic uncertainties. The recoil mass distributions from the signal process (e^+e^- \to HZ, Z \to l^+l^-) and the main backgrounds (ZZ, WW, t\bar{t} and other standard model processes) have been analyzed using a dedicated analysis code. Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5 ab^{-1} have been used for the analysis, assuming the high performance of the IDEA detector concept. The results are presented for center-of-mass energies of \sqrt{s} = 240 GeV and \sqrt{s} = 365 GeV to compare the sensitivities and highlight the potential of future e^+e^- colliders in probing the HZZ interaction with high precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Toward an event-level analysis of hadron structure using differential programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the internal properties of hadrons in terms of fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom is a central goal in nuclear and particle physics. This effort lies at the core of major experimental programs, such as the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV program and the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. A primary challenge is the inherent inverse problem: converting large-scale observational data from collision events into the fundamental quantum correlation functions (QCFs) that characterize the microscopic structure of hadronic systems within the theory of QCD. Recent advances in scientific computing and machine learning have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge using deep learning techniques. A particularly promising direction is the integration of theoretical calculations and experimental simulations into a unified framework capable of reconstructing QCFs directly from event-level information. In this work, we introduce a differential sampling method called the local orthogonal inverse transform sampling (LOITS) algorithm. We validate its performance through a closure test, demonstrating the accurate reconstruction of a test distribution from sampled events using Generative Adversarial Networks. The LOITS algorithm provides a central building block for addressing inverse problems involving QCFs and enables end-to-end inference pipelines within the framework of differential programming.</description>

Abstract: By utilizing the di-hadron fragmentation formalism, we extend the previous factorization of nearside energy-energy correlators (EEC) in the collinear limit and derive an all order resummation in the Fourier transform $b_T$-space. A perfect matching is obtained when we compare to the fixed-order results. We further demonstrate the resummation effects for the EEC in $e^+e^-$ annihilation and show that they will significantly improve the theoretical predictions at small angles.</description>

      <title>Spectral BBGKY: a scalable scheme for nonlinear Boltzmann and correlation kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy provides a time-reversal-symmetric framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of many-body systems. Despite the success of Boltzmann-based numerical approaches, systematically extending beyond this lowest-order truncation to the full nonlinear BBGKY hierarchy remains a major challenge. Moreover, even at the Boltzmann level, accurately treating the nonlinear collision term still presents significant difficulties. Here we propose the spectral BBGKY hierarchy, an analytically equivalent and numerically tractable reformulation of the conventional BBGKY hierarchy. The spectral formulation reduces the original 6n-dimensional phase-space problem to the evolution of spectral coefficients over the 3n-dimensional coordinate space. We also develop an analytic scheme for computing the collision integrals, which achieves high accuracy and removes the need for ensemble averaging over repeated stochastic evolutions from the same initial state. The scheme evaluates the full eight-fold integral exactly for massless particles, and reduces it to a three-fold one for massive particles. The validity of the spectral BBGKY hierarchy is verified through conservation law analysis, comparison with an analytical solution, convergence tests, and analysis of spectral coefficient leakage. At minimal truncation, the spectral BBGKY yields a spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation that captures full dynamics with a computational cost comparable to that of linearized approaches. When extended to higher-order truncations, the spectral BBGKY hierarchy provides a flexible framework for studying multiparticle correlations. This framework advances our ability to investigate the early thermalization puzzle in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and to elucidate the applicability of hydrodynamics at remarkably early stages of quark-gluon plasma evolution.</description>

      <title>Probing of EoS with clusters and hypernuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the nuclear equation-of-state (EoS) is a one of the primary goals of experimental and theoretical heavy-ion physics. The comparison of recent high statistics data from the STAR Collaboration with transport models provides a unique possibility to address this topic in a yet unexplored energy domain. Employing the microscopic n-body Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) transport approach, which allows to describe the propagation and interactions of hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom including cluster and hyper-nucleus formation and dynamics, we investigate the influence of different EoS on bulk observables, the multiplicity, $p_T$ and rapidity distributions of protons, $\Lambda$s and clusters up to A=4 as well as their influence on the collective flow. We explore three different EoS: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS. We find that a soft momentum dependent EoS reproduces most baryon and cluster observables, including the flow observables, quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamics of nuclear collisions with elongated structure of $^{20}$Ne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from the study of $^{20}$Ne$-$$^{20}$Ne collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 6.8 TeV using the Monte Carlo Pythia8/Angantyr model. Angantyr models heavy-ion collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon (NN) collisions, without incorporating collective effects. We construct a bi-pyramidal structure of $^{20}$Ne nucleus composed of five $\alpha$-clusters and compare its collision dynamics against those generated using Woods-Saxon nuclear density distribution. The results are further compared for different orientations of the $^{20}$Ne nuclei, including tip-tip, body-body, body-tip, and random orientations of the bi-pyramidal structure. The results show that the geometric arrangement of $\alpha$-clusters in the $^{20}$Ne nucleus significantly influences the particle production patterns in final state multiplicity, mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_T \rangle$), and elliptic flow coefficient ($v_2$). These results highlight the sensitivity of final state observables to the nuclear structure and orientation of colliding nuclei, providing insights into the dynamics of small collision systems, even in non-hydrodynamic framework.</description>

      <title>Understanding radial flow fluctuations through event-by-event momentum rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) differential radial flow fluctuation, $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, has emerged as a new probe of the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions. I present a framework that recasts $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ as a $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-dependent momentum rescaling function $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. This transformation reveals that constant rescaling ($g(p_{\mathrm{T}})=1$) alone captures the main features of $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, including its characteristic rise-and-fall pattern that emerges naturally from the particle spectral shape. Analysis of ATLAS data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV reveals small but significant deviations of $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ from unity with clear centrality dependence. This transformation converts $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ into a transparent probe of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-dependent dynamics: $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})&lt;1$ signals suppressed fluctuations while $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})&gt;1$ indicates enhanced fluctuations relative to global radial flow. Predictions for lower energies reveal spectral shape differences alone could generate substantial variations in $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. This framework enables direct connections between theoretical predictions and underlying physics mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Radiation Spectrum of the Photospheric Emission for a Turbulent Relativistic Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prompt $\gamma$-rays of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may originate from the photosphere of a relativistic jet. However, only a few GRBs have been observed with evident blackbody-like emission, for example, GRB~090902B. It has been demonstrated that internal dissipation processes, such as magnetic reconnection, can occur within the relativistic jet and thereby drive violent turbulence in the dissipation region. In this paper, we study the photospheric emission of a jet with turbulence below its photosphere. Here, the turbulence is modeled phenomenological under the assumption that the four-velocity of its eddies follows a Gaussian distribution in the jet's co-moving frame. It is found that the turbulence scatters photons to high energies and thus intensifies the emission in the high-energy regime. The corresponding distortion of the radiation field can be preserved if and only if the turbulence occurs in a region with incomplete photon-electron coupling. Consequently, the observed radiation spectrum can be reshaped into a Band-like spectrum.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and challenges to study solar neutrinos with a Q-Pix pixel readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of solar neutrinos presents significant opportunities in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. However, the low-energy nature of these neutrinos introduces considerable challenges to isolate them from background events, requiring detectors with low-energy threshold, high spatial and energy resolutions, and low data rate. We present the study of solar neutrinos with a kiloton-scale liquid argon detector located underground, instrumented with a pixel readout using the Q-Pix technology. We explore the potential of using volume fiducialization, directional topological information, light signal coincidence and pulse-shape discrimination to enhance solar neutrino sensitivity. We find that discriminating neutrino signals below 5 MeV is very difficult. However, we show that these methods are useful for the detection of solar neutrinos when external backgrounds are sufficiently understood and when the detector is built using low-background techniques. When building a workable background model for this study, we identify {\gamma} background from the cavern walls and from capture of {\alpha} particles in radon decay chains as both critical to solar neutrino sensitivity and significantly underconstrained by existing measurements. Finally, we highlight that the main advantage of the use of Q-Pix for solar neutrino studies lies in its ability to enable the continuous readout of all low-energy events with minimal data rates and manageable storage for further offline analyses.</description>

      <title>TASI/CERN/KITP Lecture Notes on "Toward Quantum Computing Gauge Theories of Nature"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of the computational campaign in nuclear and particle physics is the lattice-gauge-theory program. It continues to enable theoretical predictions for a range of phenomena in nature from the underlying Standard Model. The emergence of a new computational paradigm based on quantum computing, therefore, can introduce further advances in this program. In particular, it is believed that quantum computing will make possible first-principles studies of matter at extreme densities, and in and out of equilibrium, hence improving our theoretical description of early universe, astrophysical environments, and high-energy particle collisions. Developing and advancing a quantum-computing based lattice-gauge-theory program, therefore, is a vibrant and fast-moving area of research in theoretical nuclear and particle physics.
  These lecture notes introduce the topic of quantum computing lattice gauge theories in a pedagogical manner, with an emphasis on theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the program, and on the most common approaches and practices, to keep the presentation focused and useful. Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories is introduced within the Kogut-Susskind framework, the notion of Hilbert space and physical states is discussed, and some elementary numerical methods for performing Hamiltonian simulations are discussed. Quantum-simulation preliminaries and digital quantum-computing basics are presented, which set the stage for concrete examples of gauge-theory quantum-circuit design and resource analysis. A step-by-step analysis is provided for a simpler Abelian gauge theory, and an overview of our current understanding of the quantum-computing cost of quantum chromodynamics is presented in the end. Examples and exercises augment the material, and reinforce the concepts and methods introduced throughout.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear electrodynamics proposed by Bandos, Lechner, Sorokin and Townsend is a remarkable theory that unifies Maxwell, Bialynicki-Birula and ModMax theories, which are known theories invariant under conformal transformations and electromagnetic duality transformations. In the Bandos-Lechner-Sorokin-Townsend nonlinear electrodynamics, we calculate the energy flux density, dispersion relations, refractive indices, phase and group velocities of plane waves as well as the changes of the photon wavelength in the Compton scattering process in the presence of a constant uniform electromagnetic background. Our results are useful for testing and constraining this new theory of nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the correspondence between two well-known frameworks for QCD multiple scattering in nuclear media: the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) and the High-Twist (HT) expansion formalism. We argue that a consistent matching between both frameworks, in their common domain of validity, is achieved by incorporating the sub-eikonal longitudinal momentum phase in the CGC formalism, which mediates the transition between coherent and incoherent scattering. We perform a detailed calculation and analysis of direct photon production in proton-nucleus scattering as a concrete example to establish the matching between HT and CGC up to twist-4, including initial- and final-state interactions, as well as their interferences. The techniques developed in this work can be adapted to other processes in electron-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions, and they provide a potential avenue for a unified picture of dilute-dense dynamics in nuclear media.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons that are sufficiently light and/or weakly-interacting represent a compelling vision of dark matter. Dark photon decay into three photons, which we call the dark photon trident, can be the dominant channel when the dark photon mass falls below the electron pair threshold and can produce a significant flux of x-rays. We use 16 years of data from INTEGRAL/SPI to constrain sub-MeV dark photon decay, producing new worlds-best constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter for dark photon masses between 61 keV and 1022 keV, and comment on the potential for future x-ray observatories to discover the trident decay process.</description>

Abstract: Helicity selection rules can suppress the leading contributions from dimension-6 operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), reducing sensitivity to potential new physics. This paper explores how the interference contributions from the $\tau$ lepton's anomalous dipole moment are restored in different observable, in particular comparing the sensitivity to SMEFT operators of quantum information observables and more traditional spin correlations. We compute the sensitivity of various observables-including entanglement measures, Bell inequality violations, and quantum uncertainties-to new physics effects using Monte Carlo simulations. Spin correlation observables are found to outperform both the integrated cross-section and quantum information observables in sensitivity to both $CP$-conserving and -violating effects, improving the sensitivity to the scale of new physics by up to a factor of 3. Our results suggest that quantum information observables are suboptimal probes for resurrecting the interference, and more in general to disentangle the $CP$ properties of new physics</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hot and dense conditions of the supernova core provide an ideal environment for the production of new feebly-interacting particles. Low-energy supernovae, characterized by low explosion energy, are particularly intriguing due to their stringent constraints on energy transfer from the core to the mantle by new particles. We investigate low-energy supernova constraints on millicharged particles by considering three production channels in the core: plasmon decay, proton bremsstrahlung, and electron-positron annihilation. We compute the energy deposition due to Coulomb scatterings of millicharged particles with protons in the mantle and find that low-energy supernovae impose the most stringent constraints on millicharged particles in the mass range of $\sim(12 - 170)$ MeV. Furthermore, we find that the electron-positron annihilation process, previously omitted in supernova studies on millicharged particles, is the dominant production channel in the high-mass region. This leads to new constraints from both supernova cooling calculations and low-energy supernova analyses. We also investigate MCP production via processes involving thermal pions and find that these processes could dominate over electron-positron annihilation, albeit with significant uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Relaxation times for disoriented isospin condensates in high energy heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations between charged and neutral kaons measured by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC exceed conventional explanations. Previously it was shown that if the scalar condensate is accompanied by an electrically neutral isospin--1 field then the combination can produce large equilibrium fluctuations where $\langle \bar{u}u\rangle \ne \langle \bar{d}d\rangle$. Hadronizing strange and anti-strange quarks might then strongly fluctuate between charged ($u\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{u}$) and neutral ($d\bar{s}$ or $s\bar{d}$) kaons. Here we estimate the times for the condensates to achieve their equilibrium probability distributions within causal volumes in high energy heavy ion collisions. This is achieved by modeling the temperature dependence of the condensates, mesonic collective excitations, decay rates of the associated fields, and employing the Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. Within this model, we find that the equilibration times are short compared with the expansion time, making disoriented isospin condensates a viable explanation for the anomalous fluctuations observed at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), depending on their mass and mixing, can be efficiently produced in meson decays from the target or absorber in short- to medium-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments, leaving detectable signals through their decays inside the neutrino detectors. We show that the currently running ICARUS experiment at Fermilab can reconstruct the HNL mass and explore new HNL parameter space in the mass range of 70-190 MeV. The mass reconstruction is enabled by two ingredients: (i) simple two-body kinematics of HNL production from stopped kaon decays at the NuMI absorber, followed by HNL decay into a charged-lepton pair and neutrino at the detector, and (ii) high resolution of Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors in reconstructing final state particles. Our mass reconstruction method is robust under realistic energy resolution and angular smearing of the charged leptons, and is applicable to any LArTPC detector. We also discuss the synergy between ICARUS and future facilities like DUNE near detector and PIP-II beam dump in probing the HNL parameter space.</description>

      <title>Computation of FCC-ee Sensitivity to Heavy New Physics with Interactions of Any Flavor Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tool to compute the sensitivity of the Future Circular Electron--Positron Collider (FCC-ee) to the interactions of new, heavy particles via publicly available extensions to the smelli and flavio computer programs. We parameterize new particles' effects without any flavor assumptions and take into account the projected experimental and correlated theoretical uncertainties of various electroweak and Higgs observables at the proposed collider. We illustrate a use of the tool by estimating the sensitivity of the FCC-ee to a $Z^\prime$ model with flavor-specific couplings which explains anomalies inferred from present-day measurements and Standard Model predictions of observables that involve the $b \rightarrow s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bottomonium spectrum is systematically studied within an unquenched quark model. Based on a good description of both the masses and widths for the well-established states, we further give predictions for the higher $S$-, $P$-, and $D$-wave bottomonium states up to a mass region of $\sim 11.3$ GeV. For the vector states, the $S$-$D$ mixing and dielectron decays are studied. Additionally, to understand the role of the higher vector resonances in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation reaction, we evaluate the cross section by combining our quark model predictions for the mass, dielectron and strong decay properties. It is found that (i) The mass shifts of the high $b\bar{b}$ states due to the coupled-channel effects are the order of a few tens MeV, most of the high-lying resonances contain significant non-$b\bar{b}$ components. (ii) The $\Upsilon_1(3D,5D,6D)$ states significantly mix with $\Upsilon(4S,6S,7S)$, respectively, which is mainly induced by the intermediate hadronic loops. (iii) The non-$b\bar{b}$ components will lead a significant suppression for the dielectron decay widths of some vector resonances.(iv) The threshold effects of open-bottom meson pairs can cause rich bump structures in the cross section of $e^{+}e^{-}\to b\bar{b}$. Our model shows that the $\Upsilon(10753)$ may arise from threshold effects due to the strong coupling between $\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\bar{B}^*B^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the recently derived equation that resums DGLAP corrections to the JIMWLK Hamiltonian in the simplified setting of the SU(2) gauge theory. We solve the equation numerically for the scattering matrix of a dressed gluon for a particular initial condition, that corresponds to a dipole initial state. As expected, the $S$-matrix of a single dressed gluon state ceases to be unitary if evolved to significant $\ln Q^2/Q_s^2$. Our numerical results indicate an interesting universal (independent of the coupling constant) pattern for this deviation from unitarity.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of liquid xenon in the context of light dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a description of the electronic structure of xenon within the density-functional theory formalism with the goal of accurately modeling dark-matter-induced ionisation in liquid xenon detectors. We compare the calculated electronic structures of the atomic, liquid and crystalline solid phases, and find that the electronic charge density and its derivatives in momentum space are similar in the atom and the liquid, consistent with the weak interatomic van der Waals bonding. The only notable difference is a band broadening of the highest occupied $5p$ levels, reflected in the densities of states of the condensed phases, as a result of the inter-atomic interactions. We therefore use the calculated density of states of the liquid phase, combined with the standard literature approach for the isolated atom, to recompute ionisation rates and exclusion limit curves for the XENON10 and XENON1T experiments. We find that the broadening of the 5$p$ levels induced by the liquid phase is relevant only for dark matter masses below 6 MeV, where it increases the ionisation rate relative to that of the isolated atom. For most of the explored mass range, the energies of the discrete 4$d$ and 5$s$ levels have the strongest effect on the rate. Our findings suggest a simple scheme for calculating dark matter-electron scattering rates in liquid noble gas detectors, using the calculated values for the atom weighted by the density of states of the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Can a secluded self-interacting dark sector generate detectable gravitational waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the possibility to detect the gravitational waves generated by a secluded self-interacting dark sector. ``Secluded'' means that the dark sector has almost no portal to the visible sector and thus its entropy is conserved by itself, and ``self-interacting'' means that dark matter in this model has a significant interaction to itself, making it consistent with the small-scale structure observations. A spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ is introduced for the interactions in the dark sector, and nearly massless dark radiation is also introduced to avoid the over-closure problem. Through a parameter space scan, we find that this model is highly constrained by the current observed effective number of neutrinos ($N_{\text{eff}}$) and the large-scale structure observable Lyman-$\alpha$. Combined together, these two constraints make such a secluded self-interacting dark sector almost impossible to generate gravitational waves accessible at future projects like SKA or LISA.</description>

      <title>Double Higgs Production in Vector Boson Fusion at NLO QCD in HEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to Higgs boson pair production in vector boson fusion, including the leading operators in the framework of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT). The corresponding calculation is based on an automated interface between the Monte Carlo event generator Whizard and the one-loop amplitude generator GoSam. The QCD corrections also include non-factorising diagrams and diagrams of Higgs-Strahlung type, thus going beyond the structure function approach. We find that some constellations of anomalous couplings, while being well within the current experimental constraints, can have a significant impact on the shape of typical observables for this process.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the $X(2370)$ and $X(2600)$ as light tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the states $X(2370)$ and $X(2600)$ reported by the BESIII Collaboration, we systematically investigate the mass spectra of light compact tetraquark states with configurations $ud\bar{u}\bar{d}$, $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$, and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $2^{-+}$ channels using the QCD sum rules approach. To effectively describe these tetraquark states, we construct appropriate interpolating tetraquark currents featuring three Lorentz indices while avoiding derivative operators. Through meticulous calculations of correlation functions up to dimension 10 condensates, we extract the mass spectra for both $0^{-+}$ and $2^{-+}$ states by employing the projection operator technique. Our results indicate that the masses of light tetraquarks span $1.5-2.5~\text{GeV}$ for $0^{-+}$ states and $2.4-2.7~\text{GeV}$ for $2^{-+}$ states. Notably, our analysis suggests that the $X(2370)$ state could be interpreted as a $0^{-+}$ $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ or $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state, while the $X(2600)$ state is likely to be a $2^{-+}$ $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ tetraquark. These intriguing findings warrant further detailed investigation in future studies to better understand the nature of these states.</description>

      <title>Fully-heavy tetraquarks in the vacuum and in a hot environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermal behavior of quarkonia and fully-heavy tetraquark states associated to the charmonium, bottomonium and bottom-charmonium mass spectra. The starting point is the Schr\"odinger formalism with a vacuum Cornell-like potential. The spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor contributions are also considered to describe the structure of the vacuum quarkonia $Q\bar Q$ spectra ($Q$ denoting $c,b$ quarks). The parameters of the model are fixed using the experimental data of the $Q\bar Q$ states. After that, this formalism is extended to the fully-heavy tetraquark states within the $1^3 S_1$ axial diquark--$1^3 S_1$ axial antidiquark configuration $[QQ] [\bar Q \bar Q]$, and their vacuum mass spectra are obtained and compared to the experimental data recently obtained. Our predictions support the interpretation of the $X(6600)$ (or $X(6552)$), $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$ states as the radially-excited $T_{4c}(n^1S_0)$ configurations with $n=2,3,4$. In the sequence, we evaluate the mass spectra behavior in a thermal medium, by introducing a modified temperature-dependent Cornell potential. As a consequence, this formalism enables us to get some insight into the dissociation mechanism of $[QQ] [\bar Q \bar Q]$ states caused by a thermal medium, and into the temperature range at which the tetraquark states might be formed. We find that these structures cannot be formed in the thermal medium when the system has a temperature higher than about twice the critical temperature. These findings may be useful to better understand the features of the exotics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of the lepton number violation would be a smoking gun signal for physics beyond the Standard Model, and its most sensitive probe is the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$). Working in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we show that one-loop effects can remarkably improve the tree-level bounds on the new-physics scales for several dimension-7 operators. Using ultraviolet model examples, we then showcase the competition among $0\nu\beta\beta$ contributions induced by dimension-7 and loop-level dimension-5 SMEFT operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the updated HL-LHC projections for Higgs pair production from ATLAS and CMS and by the release of the FCC-ee Feasibility Study, we critically revisit the sensitivity of the global SMEFT analysis to deformations of the Higgs self-coupling modifier $\kappa_3$. To this end, we quantify the impact of SMEFT operators modifying double Higgs production at the LHC and single Higgs production, including loop corrections, at the FCC-ee, and include Renormalisation Group Evolution throughout. We demonstrate that significantly improving on the legacy HL-LHC constraints on $\kappa_3$ at the FCC-ee is not possible without the $\sqrt{s}=365$ GeV run; that individual and marginalised determinations are similar at the HL-LHC while differing by up to a factor 3 at the FCC-ee; and that quadratic EFT corrections cannot be neglected. Overall, the combination of HL-LHC and FCC-ee data offers unique potential to pin down the Higgs self-coupling with $\sim$$15\%$ precision.</description>

      <title>Axionless Solution to the Strong CP Problem -- two-zeros textures of the quark and lepton mass matrices and neutrino CP violation --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP invariance is a very attractive solution to the strong CP problem in QCD. This solution requires the vanishing ${\rm arg}\,[{\rm det}\, M_d\, {\rm det} M_u]$, where the $M_d$ and $M_u$ are the mass matrices for the down- and up-type quarks. It happens if we have several zeros in the quark mass matrices. We proceed a systematic construction, in this paper, of two zeros textures for the down-type quark mass matrix while the mass matrix for the up-type quarks is always diagonal. We find only three types of the mass matrices can explain the observed CKM matrix, the masses of the quarks and the charged leptons and the small enough vacuum angle $\theta &lt; 10^{-10}$. We extend the mass construction to the neutrino sector and derive predictions on the CP violating parameter $\delta_{CP}$ in the neutrino oscillation and the mass parameter $m_{\beta\beta}$. It is extremely remarkable that the normal (NH) and inverted (IH) hierarchies in the neutrino masses are equally possible in the case where we introduce only two right-handed neutrinos $N$s. Furthermore, we have a strict prediction on the $\delta_{CP} \simeq 200^\circ$ or $250^\circ$ in the NH case. If it is the case we can naturally explain the positive sign of the baryon asymmetry in the present universe.</description>

      <title>Probing Long-Range Forces in Neutrino Oscillations at the ESSnuSB Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations constitute an excellent tool to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the ESSnuSB experiment to constrain the effects of flavour-dependent long-range forces (LRFs) in neutrino oscillations, which may arise due to the extension of the Standard Model gauge group by introducing new $U(1)$ symmetries. Focusing on three specific $U(1)$ symmetries -- $L_e - L_\mu$, $L_e - L_\tau$, and $L_\mu - L_\tau$, we demonstrate that ESSnuSB offers a favourable environment to search for LRF effects. Our analyses reveal that ESSnuSB can set $90\%$ confidence level bounds of $V_{e\mu} &lt; 2.99 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, $V_{e\tau} &lt; 2.05 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, and $V_{\mu\tau} &lt; 1.81 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{eV}$, which are competitive to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). It is also observed that reducing the systematic uncertainties from $5\%$ to $2\%$ improves the ESSnuSB limits on $V_{\alpha\beta}$. Interestingly, we find limited correlations between LRF parameters and the less constrained lepton mixing parameters $\theta_{23}$ and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$, preserving the robustness of ESSnuSB's sensitivity to CP violation. Even under extreme LRF potentials ($V_{\alpha\beta} \gg 10^{-13} \, \text{eV}$), the CP-violation sensitivity and $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ precision remain largely unaffected. These results establish ESSnuSB as a competitive experimental setup for probing LRF effects, complementing constraints from other neutrino sources and offering critical insights into the physics of long-range forces.</description>

      <title>Constraining Reheating Temperature, Inflaton-SM Coupling and Dark Matter Mass in Light of ACT DR6 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological implications of the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 observations, in combination with Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, on the physics of inflation and post-inflationary reheating. We focus on the $\alpha$-attractor class of inflationary models (both E- and T-models) and consider two reheating scenarios: perturbative inflaton ($\phi$) decay ($\phi \rightarrow bb$) and inflaton annihilation ($\phi \phi \rightarrow bb$) into Standard Model (SM) bosonic particles ($b$). By solving the Boltzmann equations, we derive bounds on key reheating parameters, including the reheating temperature, the inflaton equation of state (EoS), and the inflaton-SM coupling, in light of ACT data. To accurately constrain the coupling, we incorporate the Bose enhancement effect in the decay width. To ensure the validity of our perturbative approach, we also identify the regime where nonperturbative effects, such as parametric resonance, become significant. Additionally, we include indirect constraints from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), which can impact the effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. These constraints further bound the reheating temperature, particularly in scenarios with a stiff EoS. Finally, we analyze dark matter (DM) production through purely gravitational interactions during reheating and determine the allowed mass ranges consistent with the constrained reheating parameter space and recent ACT data.</description>

      <title>Predicting the outcome of collisional neutrino flavor conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisional flavor instabilities, driven by differing neutrino and antineutrino reaction rates, are expected to occur in dense astrophysical environments like supernovae and neutron star mergers, but have yet to be incorporated in large-scale simulations. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to the classical steady state. When this classical configuration is collisional-unstable, the resulting asymptotic state reflects a compromise between classical relaxation and flavor conversion, defining a "quantum" equilibrium with nonzero coherence. This analysis highlights the possibility of a tradeoff between classical and quantum effects, an important feature with regard to the inclusion of flavor oscillation physics into global simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger FIMP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Assuming leptophilic operators connecting DM with the standard model (SM) bath, we consider DM mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and the reheat temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm rh}$) in a regime which prevents DM-SM thermalisation. Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe $T_{\rm rh} \sim O(10)$ GeV and FIMP DM with mass $m_{\rm DM} \sim O(1)$ TeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.</description>

      <title>Revising the Mass of Light Hybrid Mesons: NLO QCD Sum Rules Point to $\phi(2170)$ as a Prime Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD sum rule analysis for light hybrid mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$, incorporating condensates up to dimension-8 and NLO corrections to the perturbative, gluon condensate, and four-quark condensate contributions, which are found to be substantial and reveal the necessity of contributions beyond leading order. Employing both Laplace (LSR) and Gaussian (GSR) sum rules, our analysis predicts a mass of $2.28 \pm 0.12$ GeV for $s\bar{s}g$ and $2.22 \pm 0.18$ GeV for $u\bar{u}g$, falling within a conservative range of $2.1-2.4$ GeV. These predictions are significantly lower than previous leading-order (LO) estimates (around $2.9$ GeV) and bridge the gap between QCD sum rules, lattice QCD ($2.2-2.5$ GeV), and flux-tube models ($1.8-2.2$ GeV). Our findings establish the $\phi(2170)$ resonance as a prime candidate for the light vector hybrid meson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under a reasonable set of ab-initio assumptions, we define and chart the atlas of simple gauge theories with families of fermions whose masses are forbidden by gauge invariance. We propose a compass to navigate the atlas based on counting degrees of freedom. When searching for Grand-unification Theories with three matter generations, the free energy singles out the SU(5) Georgi-Glashow model as the minimal one, closely followed by SO(10) with spinorial matter. The atlas also defines the dryland of grand-unifiable gauge extensions of the standard model. We further provide examples relevant for gauge dual completions of the standard model as well as extensions by an additional SU(N) gauge symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we relate the factorization for $e^+e^- \to h_1 h_2 X$ to the factorization for energy-energy correlators in the collinear limit. This enables us to give a nonperturbative proof of factorization for the energy correlators, relate the energy correlator jet function to transverse-momentum-sensitive dihadron fragmentation functions, and provide a rigorous description of the confinement transition region.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter versus dark matter-induced neutrinos from single and stacked blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics responsible for the production of observed high-energy neutrinos have not been established so far, neither for the diffuse astrophysical ones nor for those detected from single blazars. We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Carroll hydrodynamics arises in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics. Instances of its relevance include the Bjorken and Gubser flow models of heavy-ion collisions, where the ultrarelativistic nature of the flow makes the physics effectively Carrollian. In this paper, we explore the structure of hydrodynamics in what can be termed as the Carrollian regime, where instead of keeping only the leading terms in the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics, we perform a small-$c$ expansion and retain the subleading terms as well. We do so both for perfect fluids as well as viscous fluids incorporating first order derivative corrections. As apposite applications of the formalism, we utilize the subleading terms to compute modifications to the Bjorken and Gubser flow equations which bring in, in particular, dependence on rapidity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topology in Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperatures by means of lattice calculations. Simulations are performed with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist with physical quark masses, and temperatures $T~\gtrsim~180$ MeV. The results obtained with three lattice spacings ranging between $0.057$ and $0.080$ fm are extrapolated to the continuum limit. We compare the results for the topological susceptibility obtained with the field-theoretic definition with those obtained from an observable constructed with the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, and we confirm their agreement -- within the largish errors -- on our range of temperatures. We also study the topological charge distribution, the next order cumulant $b_2$ and, for the first time, the Free Energy as a function of the $\theta$ angle. We find a rapid crossover to the Dilute Instanton Gas behaviour above $ T \simeq 300$ MeV for all the observables we have considered.</description>

      <title>Structure of center-vortex matter in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of center vortices is studied in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory for the first time to illuminate the interplay between elementary (center charge $\pm 1$) and doubly charged vortices. Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$ vortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in spacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations of the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in which doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of elementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is described to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A collection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure. Many of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their relative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the differences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are employed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching chains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex convergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In addition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are observed to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a constant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary vortices as it propagates. Combined, these findings provide a characterization of the vortices that comprise center-vortex structures in SU(4) Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD. In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $g^2 \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same point of $r=0$. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A^a_\mu(s)A^a_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum decoherence of curvature perturbations at superhorizon scales caused by the gravitational nonlinearities. We show that cubic gravitational couplings, constrained by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance, lead to infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) divergences in the decoherence rate at one loop. These divergences arise from fluctuations of deep IR modes which look like a background mode for a local observer and violent zero-point fluctuations in the deep UV, respectively. We argue that these divergences are unobservable, as they vanish when considering proper observables. We consider correlators defined using the geodesic distance for IR divergences and time-averaged correlators for UV divergences. To account for these observer's perspectives, we propose to consider an effective quantum state, defined in terms of actual observables, as a more appropriate probe of the quantum coherence of the system measured by an observer. We then evaluate the finite decoherence rate induced by superhorizon environment during inflation and at late universe.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles can interact with particles of the standard model. Although there are a number of constraints derived from direct and indirect detection experiments, the evolution of astrophysical objects could offer a promising probe. Obtaining predictions is challenging and primarily limited by our ability to simulate scattering between DM and baryonic particles within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We have developed the first scheme allowing for the simulation of these interacting dark matter (IDM) models, accurately accounting for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the mass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe DM-baryon interactions, we used an N-body code together with its implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction is realised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from the baryonic particle and allowing it to interact with a DM particle using a scattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). After the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic particle, fulfilling the requirements of energy and momentum conservation. Through several test problems, we demonstrated that we are able to reproduce the analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. This includes a test for scattering with a physical mass ratio of 1:1000, which is beyond the limits of SIDM simulations. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges, and we describe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the impact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing over-density. We find that it is possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations commonly used in astrophysics. Finally, our scheme allows for novel predictions to be made and new constraints on DM-baryon scattering to be set.</description>

This observable, dubbed $v_{02}(p_T)$, represents the correlation of the spectrum with elliptic flow, in the same way as the recently measured $v_0(p_T)$ represents the correlation of the spectrum with the transverse momentum per particle. The advantage of $v_{02}(p_T)$ over $v_0(p_T)$ is that it is measured using a three-particle cumulant, as opposed to a pair correlation, which significantly reduces the sensitivity to nonflow effects. We predict non-trivial differences between $v_{02}(p_T)$ and $v_0(p_T)$ in semi-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations. A hint of these differences can be seen in the modification of $p_T$ spectra observed by ALICE in event-shape-engineered events.</description>

      <title>Dark photon dark matter constraints and a tentative signal at the TASEH experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dark photon is a well motivated candidate for the dark matter which comprises most of the mass of our visible Universe, leading to worldwide experimental and observational efforts towards its discovery. A primary tool in this search is the cavity haloscope, which facilitates resonantly enhanced conversion to photons from both dark photons and axions. In this context, limits from axion search experiments are often directly converted into dark photon constraints, without re-analyzing the original data. However, this rescaling may not fully capture all of the relevant physics due to various reasons. By re-examining data taken by the Taiwan Axion Search Experiment with Haloscope (TASEH) experiment, we derive a world-leading constraint on the dark photon parameter space, excluding $|\epsilon|\gtrsim2\times10^{-14}$ in the $19.46 - 19.84\,\mu$eV mass range, which exceeds the naive `rescaling limit' by roughly one order of magnitude. In this data, we also identify a tentative signal with a local significance of 4.7$\sigma$, previously disregarded due to an axion-specific veto, corresponding to a dark photon with mass $m_X \simeq 19.5\,\mu$eV ($f_X\simeq 4.71$ GHz) and kinetic mixing $\epsilon \simeq 6.5\times10^{-15}$.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on particle and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>Transition from weak to strong coupling in thermal gauge theories: Lessons from ${\cal N}=4$ SYM Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transition between weak and strong coupling in thermal ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory as a function of 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ for several quantities of phenomenological interest for which next-to-leading order calculations are available in both regimes. We use Pad\'e approximants to interpolate between the weak and strong coupling expansions and determine the location and width of the transition between the asymptotic regimes.</description>
