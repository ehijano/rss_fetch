      <title>Reinventing Clinical Dialogue: Agentic Paradigms for LLM Enabled Healthcare Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical dialogue represents a complex duality requiring both the empathetic fluency of natural conversation and the rigorous precision of evidence-based medicine. While Large Language Models possess unprecedented linguistic capabilities, their architectural reliance on reactive and stateless processing often favors probabilistic plausibility over factual veracity. This structural limitation has catalyzed a paradigm shift in medical AI from generative text prediction to agentic autonomy, where the model functions as a central reasoning engine capable of deliberate planning and persistent memory. Moving beyond existing reviews that primarily catalog downstream applications, this survey provides a first-principles analysis of the cognitive architecture underpinning this shift. We introduce a novel taxonomy structured along the orthogonal axes of knowledge source and agency objective to delineate the provenance of clinical knowledge against the system's operational scope. This framework facilitates a systematic analysis of the intrinsic trade-offs between creativity and reliability by categorizing methods into four archetypes: \textit{Latent Space Clinicians}, \textit{Emergent Planners}, \textit{Grounded Synthesizers}, and \textit{Verifiable Workflow Automators}. For each paradigm, we deconstruct the technical realization across the entire cognitive pipeline, encompassing strategic planning, memory management, action execution, collaboration, and evolution to reveal how distinct architectural choices balance the tension between autonomy and safety.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scavenging Strategies and Cognitive Problem-Solving in Indian Free-Ranging Dogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals employ strategic decision-making while carefully weighing nutritional benefits against the risks presented by aversive or harmful stimuli in their natural environment, to maximize foraging efficiency, In India, free-ranging dogs subsist predominantly on human-generated waste, where they often encounter food contaminated with unpalatable or noxious substances such as lemon juice while scavenging. The strategies these dogs use to navigate such challenges remain poorly understood, yet are critical for understanding their ecological adaptability and survival in human-dominated environments. A total of 156 randomly encountered free-ranging adult dogs were tested across 15 sites in Nadia district, West Bengal. Each individual was exposed to a single food source containing chicken placed in either lemon juice, diluted lemon solution, or water. All trials were video-recorded, and the behavioural sequences of the dogs, including sniffing, licking, eating, and food manipulation were coded and analysed to quantify strategic foraging responses under unpalatable conditions. They were found to use a flexible, multi-pronged strategy to manipulate the comparatively less palatable food option, and typically avoid the most unpalatable one, to maximize their acquiring options. Overall, this study revealed a hierarchically structured and context-dependent foraging strategy of free-ranging dogs, propelled by sensory evaluation, risk-reward balancing, and behavioural flexibility. These findings demonstrated how urban scavengers dynamically adapt to aversive conditions while scavenging, underscoring the cognitive mechanisms that support their survival in human-dominated environments.</description>

      <title>A $p$-adic Reaction--Diffusion Model of Branching Coral Growth and Calcification Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coral colonies exhibit complex, self-similar branching architectures shaped by biochemical interactions and environmental constraints. To model their growth and calcification dynamics, we propose a novel p-adic reaction-diffusion framework defined over p-adic ultrametric spaces. The model incorporates biologically grounded reactions involving calcium and bicarbonate ions, whose interplay drives the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Nonlocal diffusion is governed by the Vladimirov operator over the p-adic integers, naturally capturing the hierarchical geometry of branching coral structures. Discretization over p-adic balls yields a high-dimensional nonlinear ODE system, which we solve numerically to examine how environmental and kinetic parameters, particularly CO2 concentration, influence morphogenetic outcomes. The resulting simulations reproduce structurally diverse and biologically plausible branching patterns. This approach bridges non-Archimedean analysis with morphogenesis modeling and provides a mathematically rigorous framework for investigating hierarchical structure formation in developmental biology.</description>
