      <title>Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Constructive Lyapunov Functions via Topology-Preserving Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that ONN achieves order-optimal performance on convergence rate ($\mu \propto \lambda_2$), edge efficiency ($E = N$ for minimal connectivity $k = 2$), and computational complexity ($O(N d^2)$). Empirical validation on 3M-node semantic networks demonstrates 99.75\% improvement over baseline methods, confirming exponential convergence ($\mu = 3.2 \times 10^{-4}$) and topology preservation. ORTSF integration into transformers achieves 14.7\% perplexity reduction and 2.3 faster convergence on WikiText-103. We establish deep connections to optimal control (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman), information geometry (Fisher-efficient natural gradient), topological data analysis (persistent homology computation in $O(KN)$), discrete geometry (Ricci flow), and category theory (adjoint functors). This work transforms Massera's abstract existence theorem into a concrete, scalable algorithm with provable guarantees, opening pathways for constructive stability analysis in neural networks, robotics, and distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Principal and Combination Parametric Resonances of an Electromagnetically Suspended Vehicle subject to Base Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic stability of an electromagnetically suspended vehicle, encountered in Hyperloop and Maglev systems, subject to periodic excitations caused by surface irregularities or vibration of the support induced by external noise. The narrow clearance between the vehicle and the support can make it highly sensitive to small oscillations, since the admissible amplitudes of the vehicle oscillations can be comparable to external excitation amplitude. The vehicle is modelled as a three-degree-of-freedom model where the vehicle is suspended via two identical electromagnetic actuators from a rigid support that oscillates. The governing equations are derived using force and torque balances, incorporating nonlinear electromagnetic forces, and Kirchhoffs law for the electromagnets with PD control strategy on the airgap. The equations of motion are linearized around the steady state induced by the surface oscillation, yielding a system with time-periodic coefficients. We analytically explore both principal and combination parametric resonances using an extended Hills method, and Floquet theory is used for numerical validation. The stability boundaries are obtained as ellipses in control gain parameter space, and the influence of system parameters on these boundaries is characterized. For the principal parametric resonance, the ratio of the sizes of the two obtained ellipses is three to one, whereas for the combination parametric resonance, the ratio is fourteen to one. When all ellipses are simultaneously present, one of the ellipses associated with the combination parametric resonance is the largest.</description>

      <title>Stable-by-Design Neural Network-Based LPV State-Space Models for System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of nonlinear systems is essential for reliable control, yet conventional identification methods often struggle to capture latent dynamics while maintaining stability. We propose a \textit{stable-by-design LPV neural network-based state-space} (NN-SS) model that simultaneously learns latent states and internal scheduling variables directly from data. The state-transition matrix, generated by a neural network using the learned scheduling variables, is guaranteed to be stable through a Schur-based parameterization. The architecture combines an encoder for initial state estimation with a state-space representer network that constructs the full set of scheduling-dependent system matrices. For training the NN-SS, we develop a framework that integrates multi-step prediction losses with a state-consistency regularization term, ensuring robustness against drift and improving long-horizon prediction accuracy. The proposed NN-SS is evaluated on benchmark nonlinear systems, and the results demonstrate that the model consistently matches or surpasses classical subspace identification methods and recent gradient-based approaches. These findings highlight the potential of stability-constrained neural LPV identification as a scalable and reliable framework for modeling complex nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Decision-Support and Optimization of EV Charging Infrastructure in Localized Urban Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption accelerates in urban environments, optimizing charging infrastructure is vital for balancing user satisfaction, energy efficiency, and financial viability. This study advances beyond static models by proposing a digital twin framework that integrates agent-based decision support with embedded optimization to dynamically simulate EV charging behaviors, infrastructure layouts, and policy responses across scenarios. Applied to a localized urban site (a university campus) in Hanoi, Vietnam, the model evaluates operational policies, EV station configurations, and renewable energy sources. The interactive dashboard enables seasonal analysis, revealing a 20% drop in solar efficiency from October to March, with wind power contributing under 5% of demand, highlighting the need for adaptive energy management. Simulations show that real-time notifications of newly available charging slots improve user satisfaction, while gasoline bans and idle fees enhance slot turnover with minimal added complexity. Embedded metaheuristic optimization identifies near-optimal mixes of fast (30kW) and standard (11kW) solar-powered chargers, balancing energy performance, profitability, and demand with high computational efficiency. This digital twin provides a flexible, computation-driven platform for EV infrastructure planning, with a transferable, modular design that enables seamless scaling from localized to city-wide urban contexts.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Merging Control of Connected and Automated Vehicles to Enhance Safety and Energy Efficiency using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24871v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized Control Barrier Function (CBF) based approach for highway merging of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). In this control algorithm, each "host" vehicle negotiates with other agents in a control zone of the highway network, and enacts its own action, to perform safe and energy-efficient merge maneuvers. It uses predictor-corrector loops within the robust CBF setting for negotiation and to reconcile disagreements that may arise. There is no explicit order of vehicles and no priority. A notable feature is absence of gridlocks due to instability of the inter-agent system. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show significant improvement in the system-wide energy efficiency and traffic flow compared to a first-in-first-out approach, as well as enhanced robustness of the proposed decentralized controller compared to its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>Delay Tolerant Control for Autonomous Driving Using CDOB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of autonomous vehicle technologies, effective path-tracking control has become a critical component in ensuring safety and efficiency in complex traffic scenarios. When a high level decision making agent generates a collision free path, a robust low level controller is required to precisely follow this trajectory. However, connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) are inherently affected by communication delays and computation delays, which significantly degrade the performance of conventional controllers such as PID or other more advanced controllers like disturbance observers (DOB). While DOB-based designs have shown effectiveness in rejecting disturbances under nominal conditions, their performance deteriorates considerably in the presence of unknown time delays. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a delay-tolerant communication disturbance observer (CDOB) framework for path-tracking control in delayed systems. The proposed CDOB compensates for the adverse effects of time delays, maintaining accurate trajectory tracking even under uncertain and varying delay conditions. It is shown through a simulation study that the proposed control architecture maintains close alignment with the reference trajectory across various scenarios, including single lane change, double-= lane change, and Elastic Band generated collision avoidance paths under various time delays. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches in both tracking accuracy and delay robustness, making it well suited for autonomous driving applications.</description>

      <title>A Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Framework with Soft Constraints for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reachability methods provide formal guarantees of safety under bounded disturbances. However, they strictly enforce state constraints as inviolable, which can result in overly conservative or infeasible solutions in complex operational scenarios. Many constraints encountered in practice, such as bounds on battery state of charge in electric vehicles, recommended speed envelopes, and comfort constraints in passenger-carrying vehicles, are inherently soft. Soft constraints allow temporary violations within predefined safety margins to accommodate uncertainty and competing operational demands, albeit at a cost such as increased wear or higher operational expenses. This paper introduces a novel soft-constrained reachability framework that extends Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis for the formal verification of safety-critical systems subject to both hard and soft constraints. Specifically, the framework characterizes a subset of the state space, referred to as the soft-constrained reach-avoid set, from which the system is guaranteed to reach a desired set safely, under worst-case disturbances, while ensuring that cumulative soft-constraint violations remain within a user-specified budget. The framework comprises two principal components: (i) an augmented-state model with an auxiliary budget state that tracks soft-constraint violations, and (ii) a regularization-based approximation of the discontinuous Hamilton-Jacobi value function associated with the reach-avoid differential game studied herein. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical examples involving the landing of a simple point-mass model and a fixed-wing aircraft executing an emergency descent, both under wind disturbances. The simulation results validate the framework's ability to simultaneously manage both hard and soft constraints in safety-critical settings</description>

      <title>Control Synthesis with Reinforcement Learning: A Modeling Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllers designed with reinforcement learning can be sensitive to model mismatch. We demonstrate that designing such controllers in a virtual simulation environment with an inaccurate model is not suitable for deployment in a physical setup. Controllers designed using an accurate model is robust against disturbance and small mismatch between the physical setup and the mathematical model derived from first principles; while a poor model results in a controller that performs well in simulation but fails in physical experiments. Sensitivity analysis is used to justify these discrepancies and an empirical region of attraction estimation help us visualize their robustness.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Long-Term Joint Decarbonization Planning for Power Systems and Data Centers: A Case Study in PJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services, data centers have become critical infrastructures driving digital economies, with increasing energy demand heightening concerns over electricity use and carbon emissions, emphasizing the need for carbon-aware infrastructure planning. Most studies assume static power systems, focus only on operational emissions, and overlook co-optimization. This paper proposes a dynamic joint planning framework that co-optimizes long-term data center and power system development over 15 years. The model determines siting, capacity, and type of data centers alongside power generation expansion, storage deployment, and retirements, accounting for both operational and embodied emissions. To handle multi-scale uncertainty, a large-scale two-stage stochastic program is formulated and solved via an enhanced Benders decomposition. Applied to the PJM Interconnection, with curated datasets released on GitHub, results show the system can support up to 55 GW peak data center demand, with Virginia (DOM) and Northern Illinois (ComEd) as optimal hosts. Compared to non-joint planning, the framework cuts investment cost by 12.6%, operational cost by 8.25%, and emissions by 5.63%. Including lifecycle emissions further raises renewable deployment by 25.5%, highlighting embodied carbon's role in deeper decarbonization.</description>

      <title>The Waterbed Effect on Quasiperiodic Disturbance Observer: Avoidance of Sensitivity Tradeoff with Time Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In linear time-invariant systems, the sensitivity function to disturbances is designed under a sensitivity tradeoff known as the waterbed effect. To compensate for a quasiperiodic disturbance, a quasiperiodic disturbance observer using time delays was proposed. Its sensitivity function avoids the sensitivity tradeoff, achieving wideband harmonic suppression without amplifying aperiodic disturbances or shifting harmonic suppression frequencies. However, its open-loop transfer function is not rational and does not satisfy the assumptions of existing Bode sensitivity integrals due to its time delays. This paper provides Bode-like sensitivity integrals for the quasiperiodic disturbance observer in both continuous-time and discrete-time representations and clarifies the avoided sensitivity tradeoff with time delays.</description>

      <title>Silicon-based Josephson junction field-effect transistors enabling cryogenic logic and quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous miniaturisation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) from long- to short-channel architectures has advanced beyond the predictions of Moore's Law. Continued advances in semiconductor electronics, even near current scaling and performance boundaries under cryogenic conditions, are driving the development of innovative device paradigms that enable ultra-low-power and high-speed functionality. Among emerging candidates, the Josephson Junction Field-Effect Transistor (JJFET or JoFET) provides an alternative by integrating superconducting source and drain electrodes for efficient, phase-coherent operation at ultra-low temperatures. These hybrid devices have the potential to bridge conventional semiconductor electronics with cryogenic logic and quantum circuits, enabling energy-efficient and high-coherence signal processing across temperature domains. This review traces the evolution from Josephson junctions to field-effect transistors, emphasising the structural and functional innovations that underpin modern device scalability. The performance and material compatibility of JJFETs fabricated on Si, GaAs, and InGaAs substrates are analysed, alongside an assessment of their switching dynamics and material compatibility. Particular attention is given to superconductor-silicon-superconductor Josephson junctions as the active core of JJFET architectures. By unfolding more than four decades of experimental progress, this work highlights the promise of JJFETs as foundational building blocks for next-generation cryogenic logic and quantum electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Shared Control for Vehicle Lane-Changing with Uncertain Driver Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane changes are common yet challenging driving maneuvers that require continuous decision-making and dynamic interaction with surrounding vehicles. Relying solely on human drivers for lane-changing can lead to traffic disturbances due to the stochastic nature of human behavior and its variability under different task demands. Such uncertainties may significantly degrade traffic string stability, which is critical for suppressing disturbance propagation and ensuring smooth merging of the lane-changing vehicles. This paper presents a human-automation shared lane-changing control framework that preserves driver authority while allowing automated assistance to achieve stable maneuvers in the presence of driver's behavioral uncertainty. Human driving behavior is modeled as a Markov jump process with transitions driven by task difficulty, providing a tractable representation of stochastic state switching. Based on this model, we first design a nominal stabilizing controller that guarantees stochastic ${L}_2$ string stability under imperfect mode estimation. To further balance performance and automated effort, we then develop a Minimal Intervention Controller (MIC) that retains acceptable stability while limiting automation. Simulations using lane-changing data from the NGSIM dataset verify that the nominal controller reduces speed perturbations and shorten lane-changing time, while the MIC further reduces automated effort and enhances comfort but with moderate stability and efficiency loss. Validations on the TGSIM dataset with SAE Level 2 vehicles show that the MIC enables earlier lane changes than Level 2 control while preserving driver authority with a slight stability compromise. These findings highlight the potential of shared control strategies to balance stability, efficiency, and driver acceptance.</description>

      <title>Data-Enabled Predictive Control and Guidance for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a fully data-driven control framework for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC). The approach eliminates the need for explicit hydrodynamic modeling by exploiting measured input-output data to predict and optimize future system behavior. Classic DeePC was employed in the heading control, while a cascaded DeePC architecture is proposed for depth regulation, incorporating a loop-frequency separation to handle the different dynamic modes of input and output. For 3-D waypoint path following, the Adaptive Line-of-Sight algorithm is extended to a predictive formulation and integrated with DeePC. All methods are validated in extensive simulation on the REMUS 100 AUV and compared with classical PI/PID control. The results demonstrate superior tracking performance and robustness of DeePC under ocean-current disturbances and nonlinear operating conditions, while significantly reducing modeling effort.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory planning in dense, interactive traffic scenarios presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles, primarily due to the uncertainty of human driver behavior and the non-convex nature of collision avoidance constraints. This paper introduces a stochastic optimal control framework to address these issues simultaneously, without excessively conservative approximations. We opt to model human driver decisions as a Markov Decision Process and propose a method for handling collision avoidance between non-convex vehicle shapes by imposing a positive distance constraint between compact sets. In this framework, we investigate three alternative chance constraint formulations. To ensure computational tractability, we introduce tight, continuously differentiable reformulations of both the non-convex distance constraints and the chance constraints. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through simulation studies of two challenging interactive scenarios: an unregulated intersection crossing and a highway lane change in dense traffic.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Federated Learning in Mobile Edge Computing with Statistical and Device Heterogeneity Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, but high communication and computation costs, exacerbated by statistical and device heterogeneity, limit its practicality in mobile edge computing. Existing compression methods like sparsification and pruning reduce per-round costs but may increase training rounds and thus the total training cost, especially under heterogeneous environments. We propose a lightweight personalized FL framework built on parameter decoupling, which separates the model into shared and private subspaces, enabling us to uniquely apply gradient sparsification to the shared component and model pruning to the private one. This structural separation confines communication compression to global knowledge exchange and computation reduction to local personalization, protecting personalization quality while adapting to heterogeneous client resources. We theoretically analyze convergence under the combined effects of sparsification and pruning, revealing a sparsity-pruning trade-off that links to the iteration complexity. Guided by this analysis, we formulate a joint optimization that selects per-client sparsity and pruning rates and wireless bandwidth to reduce end-to-end training time. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence and substantial reductions in overall communication and computation costs with negligible accuracy loss, validating the benefits of coordinated and resource-aware personalization in resource-constrained heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling for Secure RIS-Assisted ISAC in 6G UAV Corridors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) corridors in sixth-generation (6G) networks requires safe, intelligence-driven integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance spectrum efficiency, localisation accuracy, and situational awareness, while introducing new vulnerabilities. The rise of quantum computing increases the risks associated with harvest-now-decrypt-later strategies and quantum-enhanced spoofing. We propose a Quantum-Resilient Threat Modelling (QRTM) framework for RIS-assisted ISAC in UAV corridors to address these challenges. QRTM integrates classical, quantum-ready, and quantum-aided adversaries, countered using post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives: ML-KEM for key establishment and Falcon for authentication, both embedded within RIS control signalling and UAV coordination. To strengthen security sensing, the framework introduces RIS-coded scene watermarking validated through a generalised likelihood ratio test (GLRT), with its detection probability characterised by the Marcum Q function. Furthermore, a Secure ISAC Utility (SIU) jointly optimises secrecy rate, spoofing detection, and throughput under RIS constraints, enabled by a scheduler with computational complexity of O(n^2). Monte Carlo evaluations using 3GPP Release 19 mid-band urban-canyon models (7-15 GHz) demonstrate a spoof-detection probability approaching 0.99 at a false-alarm rate of 1e-3, secrecy-rate retention exceeding 90 percent against quantum-capable adversaries, and signal-interference utilisation improvements of about 25 percent compared with baselines. These results show a standards-compliant path towards reliable, quantum-resilient ISAC for UAV corridors in smart cities and non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>A New Neural Network Paradigm for Scalable and Generalizable Stability Analysis of Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new neural network (NN) paradigm for scalable and generalizable stability analysis of power systems. The paradigm consists of two parts: the neural stability descriptor and the sample-augmented iterative training scheme. The first part, based on system decomposition, constructs the object (such as a stability function or condition) for stability analysis as a scalable aggregation of multiple NNs. These NNs remain fixed across varying power system structures and parameters, and are repeatedly shared within each system instance defined by these variations, thereby enabling the generalization of the neural stability descriptor across a class of power systems. The second part learns the neural stability descriptor by iteratively training the NNs with sample augmentation, guided by the tailored conservativeness-aware loss function. The training set is strategically constructed to promote the descriptor's generalizability, which is systematically evaluated by verification and validation during the training process. Specifically, the proposed NN paradigm is implemented for large-disturbance stability analysis of the bulk power grid and small-disturbance stability conditions of the microgrid system. Finally, numerical studies for the two implementations demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed NN paradigm.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Heuristic Approaches for Platooning Systems with Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25564v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient truck platooning is a key strategy for reducing freight costs, lowering fuel consumption, and mitigating emissions. Deadlines are critical in this context, as trucks must depart within specific time windows to meet delivery requirements and avoid penalties. In this paper, we investigate the optimal formation and dispatch of truck platoons at a highway station with finite capacity $L$ and deadline constraints $T$. The system operates in discrete time, with each arriving truck assigned a deadline of $T$ slot units. The objective is to leverage the efficiency gains from forming large platoons while accounting for waiting costs and deadline violations. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and analyze the structure of the optimal policy $\pi^\star$ for $L = 3$, extending insights to arbitrary $L$. We prove certain monotonicity properties of the optimal policy in the state space $\mathcal{S}$ and identify classes of unreachable states. Moreover, since the size of $\mathcal{S}$ grows exponentially with $L$ and $T$, we propose heuristics -- including conditional and deep-learning based approaches -- that exploit these structural insights while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Social Awareness into Control of Unknown Multi-Agent Systems: A Real-Time Spatiotemporal Tubes Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework that incorporates social awareness into multi-agent systems with unknown dynamics to achieve prescribed-time reach-avoid-stay tasks in dynamic environments. Each agent is assigned a social awareness index that quantifies its level of cooperation or self-interest, allowing heterogeneous social behaviors within the system. Building on the spatiotemporal tube (STT) framework, we propose a real-time STT framework that synthesizes tubes online for each agent while capturing its social interactions with others. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is derived to ensure that each agent remains within its evolving STT, thereby avoiding dynamic obstacles while also preventing inter-agent collisions in a socially aware manner, and reaching the target within a prescribed time. The proposed approach provides formal guarantees on safety and timing, and is computationally lightweight, model-free, and robust to unknown disturbances. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are validated through simulation and hardware experiments on a 2D omnidirectional</description>

      <title>An OPF-based Control Framework for Hybrid AC-MTDC Power Systems under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, introduces significant uncertainty into hybrid AC-HVDC systems due to forecast errors and power fluctuations. Conventional control strategies typically rely on fixed setpoints and neglect frequency deviations, which can compromise system stability under rapid renewable variations. To address this challenge, this paper presents a forecast-integrated, optimal power flow (OPF)-based adaptive control framework. Wind speed forecasts generated using a Random Forest model are incorporated into a time-coupled OPF to determine baseline converter setpoints in anticipation of wind fluctuations, which are further adjusted in real time based on actual operating conditions. An adaptive droop control scheme is developed that jointly considers DC voltage and AC frequency deviations. The effectiveness of the proposed control framework is validated through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, demonstrating its capability to ensure stable and robust operation of hybrid AC-HVDC systems under high penetration of renewable energy.</description>

      <title>Over 3 kV and Ultra-Low leakage Vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Power Diodes with Engineered Schottky Contact and High-permittivity Dielectric Field Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report over 3 kV breakdown voltage and ultra-low leakage (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices utilizing Schottky barrier engineering and high-permittivity (\k{appa}) dielectric (ZrO2) field plate. The (011) orientation of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift layers which are promising to support kV-class vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power switches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse blocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the interfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a co-processed Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same wafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ~1.5 kV, while the field-plate Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage of 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the breakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled breakdown voltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management by composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage, edge field reduction by high-\k{appa} dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as the advantageous material properties offered by (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 demonstrate a promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class vertical (011) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 power devices.</description>

      <title>Artificial Transmission Line Synthesis Tailored for Traveling-Wave Parametric Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and capacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design methods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are lacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial transmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive network synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space: periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission line.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to QoSAware Load Balancing in 5G Cellular Networks under User Mobility and Observation Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators (aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends (higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based toolchain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated robotic fused deposition modeling additive manufacturing system featuring closed-loop thermal control and intelligent in-situ defect correction using a 6-degree of freedom robotic arm and an Oak-D camera. The robot arm end effector was modified to mount an E3D hotend thermally regulated by an IoT microcontroller, enabling precise temperature control through real-time feedback. Filament extrusion system was synchronized with robotic motion, coordinated via ROS2, ensuring consistent deposition along complex trajectories. A vision system based on OpenCV detects layer-wise defects position, commanding autonomous re-extrusion at identified sites. Experimental validation demonstrated successful defect mitigation in printing operations. The integrated system effectively addresses challenges real-time quality assurance. Inverse kinematics were used for motion planning, while homography transformations corrected camera perspectives for accurate defect localization. The intelligent system successfully mitigated surface anomalies without interrupting the print process. By combining real-time thermal regulation, motion control, and intelligent defect detection &amp; correction, this architecture establishes a scalable and adaptive robotic additive manufacturing framework suitable for aerospace, biomedical, and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and CPU (Central Processing Unit) Scheduling Co-Optimization over a Network of Computing Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and (ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications, distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A problem of achieving minimum time consensus for a set of $N$ second-order LTI system agents with bounded inputs and fuel constraints is considered. Unlike our other works, here the damping effect in agent dynamics is included. First, the attainable set for each agent with fuel budget constraints is characterized, and its boundary equations are derived. Then, using the convexity property, the minimum time at which attainable sets of all agents have a non-empty intersection is computed. By applying Helly's theorem, the computation reduces to finding the minimum time to consensus and the corresponding consensus point for each of the triplets separately.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustics on the go: An Embedded Photoacoustic Sensing Platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several centimeters below the skin lie multiple biomarkers, such as glucose, oxygenation, and blood flow. Monitoring these biomarkers regularly and in a non-invasive manner would enable early insight into metabolic status and vascular health. Currently, there are only a handful of non-invasive monitoring systems. Optical methods offer molecular specificity (i.e., multi-biomarker monitoring) but have shallow reach (a few millimeters); ultrasound penetrates deeper but lacks specificity; and MRI is large, slow, and costly. Photoacoustic (PA) sensing combines the best of optical and ultrasound methods. A laser transmitter emits pulses that are absorbed by different molecules, providing specificity. These light pulses generate pressure changes that are captured by an ultrasound receiver, providing depth. Photoacoustic sensing is promising, but the current platforms are bulky, complex, and costly. We propose the first embedded PA platform. Our contributions are fourfold. First, inspired by LiDAR technology, we propose a novel transmitter that emits pulses similar to those in the state-of-the-art (SoA), but instead of using high-voltage sources and complex electronic interfaces, we use a simple low-power microcontroller (MCU). Second, we carry out a thorough analysis of our custom transmitter and a commercial system. Third, we build a basic ultrasound receiver that is able to process the faint signal generated by our transmitter. Lastly, we compare the performance of our platform against a SoA commercial system, and show that we can detect glucose and (de)oxygenated hemoglobin in two controlled solution studies. The resulting signal characteristics indicate a plausible path toward noninvasive, real-time, at-home sensing relevant to diabetes care. More broadly, this platform lays the groundwork for translating the promise of PA sensing into a broader practical reality.</description>

      <title>Integrating Legal and Logical Specifications in Perception, Prediction, and Planning for Automated Driving: A Survey of Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms, facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible. The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception, logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation. We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilization Using Prior Knowledge on Stabilizability and Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25452v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study data-driven stabilization of linear time-invariant systems using prior knowledge of system-theoretic properties, specifically stabilizability and controllability. To formalize this, we extend the concept of data informativity by requiring the existence of a controller that stabilizes all systems consistent with the data and the prior knowledge. We show that if the system is controllable, then incorporating this as prior knowledge does not relax the conditions required for data-driven stabilization. Remarkably, however, we show that if the system is stabilizable, then using this as prior knowledge leads to necessary and sufficient conditions that are weaker than those for data-driven stabilization without prior knowledge. In other words, data-driven stabilization is easier if one knows that the underlying system is stabilizable. We also provide new data-driven control design methods in terms of linear matrix inequalities that complement the conditions for informativity.</description>

      <title>Combining Moving Mass Actuators and Manoeuvring Models for Underwater Vehicles: A Lagrangian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator. Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen (1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass actuator formulation.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares Certificates for Almost-Sure Reachability of Stochastic Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational approach to certify almost sure reachability for discrete-time polynomial stochastic systems by turning drift--variant criteria into sum-of-squares (SOS) programs solved with standard semidefinite solvers. Specifically, we provide an SOS method based on two complementary certificates: (i) a drift certificate that enforces a radially unbounded function to be non-increasing in expectation outside a compact set of states; and (ii) a variant certificate that guarantees a one-step decrease with positive probability and ensures the target contains its nonpositive sublevel set. We transform these conditions to SOS constraints. For the variant condition, we enforce a robust decrease over a parameterized disturbance ball with nonzero probability and encode the constraints via an S-procedure with polynomial multipliers. The resulting bilinearities are handled by an alternating scheme that alternates between optimizing multipliers and updating the variant and radius until a positive slack is obtained. Two case studies illustrate the workflow and certifies almost-sure reachability.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Cooperative Rate Splitting for Satellite-to-Underground Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable downlink communication in satellite-to-underground networks remains challenging due to severe signal attenuation caused by underground soil and refraction in the air-soil interface. To address this, we propose a novel cooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an aboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices (UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization problem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time slot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a deep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling and a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic underground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\%$ over conventional benchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation by Local Design in Cooperative Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the privacy preservation problem in a cooperative networked control system, which has closed-loop dynamics, working for the task of linear quadratic Guassian (LQG) control. The system consists of a user and a server: the user owns the plant to control, while the server provides computation capability, and the user employs the server to compute control inputs for it. To enable the server's computation, the user needs to provide the measurements of the plant states to the server, who then calculates estimates of the states, based on which the control inputs are computed. However, the user regards the states as privacy, and makes an interesting request: the user wants the server to have "incorrect" knowledge of the state estimates rather than the true values. Regarding that, we propose a novel design methodology for the privacy preservation, in which the privacy scheme is locally equipped at the user side not open to the server, which manages to create a deviation in the server's knowledge of the state estimates from the true values. However, this methodology also raises significant challenges: in a closed-loop dynamic system, when the server's seized knowledge is incorrect, the system's behavior becomes complex to analyze; even the stability of the system becomes questionable, as the incorrectness will accumulate through the closed loop as time evolves. In this paper, we succeed in showing that the performance loss in LQG control caused by the proposed privacy scheme is bounded by rigorous mathematical proofs, which convinces the availability of the proposed design methodology. We also propose an associated novel privacy metric and obtain the analytical result on evaluating the privacy performance. Finally, we study the performance trade-off between privacy and control, where the accordingly proposed optimization problems are solved by numerical methods efficiently.</description>

      <title>ES-HPC-MPC: Exponentially Stable Hybrid Perception Constrained MPC for Quadrotor with Suspended Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerial transportation using quadrotors with cable-suspended payloads holds great potential for applications in disaster response, logistics, and infrastructure maintenance. However, their hybrid and underactuated dynamics pose significant control and perception challenges. Traditional approaches often assume a taut cable condition, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications where slack-to-taut transitions occur due to disturbances. We introduce ES-HPC-MPC, a model predictive control framework that enforces exponential stability and perception-constrained control under hybrid dynamics.
  Our method leverages Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions (ES-CLFs) to enforce stability during the tasks and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to maintain the payload within the onboard camera's field of view (FoV). We validate our method through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating stable trajectory tracking and reliable payload perception. We validate that our method maintains stability and satisfies perception constraints while tracking dynamically infeasible trajectories and when the system is subjected to hybrid mode transitions caused by unexpected disturbances.</description>

      <title>Operational Risks in Grid Integration of Large Data Center Loads: Characteristics, Stability Assessments, and Sensitivity Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic interactions between large-scale data centers and the power grid, focusing on reliability challenges arising from sudden fluctuations in demand. With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot Motion Planning based on Nets-within-Nets Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on designing motion plans for a heterogeneous team of robots that must cooperate to fulfill a global mission. Robots move in an environment that contains some regions of interest, while the specification for the entire team can include avoidance, visits, or sequencing of these regions of interest. The mission is expressed in terms of a Petri net corresponding to an automaton, while each robot is also modeled by a state machine Petri net. The current work brings about the following contributions with respect to existing solutions for related problems. First, we propose a novel model, denoted High-Level robot team Petri Net (HLrtPN) system, to incorporate the specification and robot models into the Nets-within-Nets paradigm. A guard function, named Global Enabling Function, is designed to synchronize the firing of transitions so that robot motions do not violate the specification. Then, the solution is found by simulating the HLrtPN system in a specific software tool that accommodates Nets-within-Nets. Illustrative examples based on Linear Temporal Logic missions support the computational feasibility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Continuity Conditions for Piecewise Quadratic Functions on Simplicial Conic Partitions are Equivalent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of continuous-time piecewise linear systems based on piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov functions typically requires continuity of these functions over a partition of the state space. Several conditions for guaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be found in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity conditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can be based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or numerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Path Planning and Task Allocation Algorithm for Boolean Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel path-planning and task assignment algorithm for multi-robot systems that should fulfill a global Boolean specification. The proposed method is based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations, which are combined with structural insights from Petri nets to improve scalability and computational efficiency. By proving that the \emph{constraint matrix} is totally unimodular (TU) for certain classes of problems, the ILP formulation can be relaxed into a Linear Programming (LP) problem without losing the integrality of the solution. This relaxation eliminates complex combinatorial techniques, significantly reducing computational overhead and thus ensuring scalability for large-scale systems. Using the approach proposed in this paper, we can solve path-planning problems for teams made up to 500 robots. The method guarantees computational tractability, handles collision avoidance and reduces computational demands through iterative LP optimization techniques. Case studies demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating scalable, collision-free paths for large robot teams navigating in complex environments. While the conservative nature of collision avoidance introduces additional constraints, and thus, computational requirements, the solution remains practical and impactful for diverse applications. The algorithm is particularly applicable to real-world scenarios, including warehouse logistics where autonomous robots must efficiently coordinate tasks or search-and-rescue operations in various environments. This work contributes both theoretically and practically to scalable multi-robot path planning and task allocation, offering an efficient framework for coordinating autonomous agents in shared environments.</description>

      <title>Online Adaptation for Flying Quadrotors in Tight Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical experiments is available here: https://youtu.be/9QX1Q5Ut9Rs</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarms. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines the classic opinion dynamics (the French-DeGroot model) with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuee agents in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to the Vicsek flocking model, and it is meaningful to explore complex social behavior during phase transition of a non-equilibrium process.</description>

Abstract: We derive closed-form extensions of Riccati's recursions (both sequential and parallel) for solving dual-regularized LQR problems. We show how these methods can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We provide MIT-licensed implementations of our methods in C++ and JAX.</description>
