      <title>Explorative pedestrian mobility GPS data from a citizen science experiment in a neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian GPS data are key to a better understanding of micro-mobility and micro-behaviour within a neighbourhood. These data can bring new insights into walkability and livability in the context of urban sustainability. However, pedestrian open data are scarce and often lack a context for their transformation into actionable knowledge in a neighbourhood. Citizen science and public involvement practices are powerful instruments for obtaining these data and take a community-centred placemaking approach. The study shares some 3000 GPS recordings corresponding to 19 unique trajectories made and recorded by groups of participants from three distinct communities in a relatively small neighbourhood. The groups explored the neighbourhood through a number of tasks and chose different places to stop and perform various social and festive activities. The study shares not only raw data but also processed records with specific filtering and processing to facilitate and accelerate data usage. Citizen science practices and the data-collection protocols involved are reported in order to offer a complete perspective of the research undertaken jointly with an assessment of how community-centred placemaking and operative mapping are incorporated into local urban transformation actions.</description>

      <title>Who should fight the spread of fake news?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08753v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates who should bear the responsibility of combating the spread of misinformation in social networks. Should that be the online platforms or their users? Should that be done by debunking the "fake news" already in circulation or by investing in preemptive efforts to prevent their diffusion altogether? We seek to answer such questions in a stylized opinion dynamics framework, where agents in a network aggregate the information they receive from peers and/or from influential external sources, with the aim of learning a ground truth among a set of competing hypotheses. In most cases, we find centralized sources to be more effective at combating misinformation than distributed ones, suggesting that online platforms should play an active role in the fight against fake news. In line with literature on the "backfire effect", we find that debunking in certain circumstances can be a counterproductive strategy, whereas some targeted strategies (akin to "deplatforming") and/or preemptive campaigns turn out to be quite effective. Despite its simplicity, our model provides useful guidelines that could inform the ongoing debate on online disinformation and the best ways to limit its damaging effects.</description>

      <title>Derivation of macroscopic epidemic models from multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic review of some basic results on the derivation of classical epidemiological models from simple agent-based dynamics. The evolution of large populations is coupled with the dynamics of the contact distribution, providing insights into how individual behaviors impact macroscopic epidemiological trends. The resulting set of equations incorporates local characteristics of the operator governing the emergence of a family of contact distributions. To validate the proposed approach, we provide several numerical results based on asymptotic preserving methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the multi-scale nature of the problem and ensuring robust performance across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Interdependency and cascading failures in co-patenting and shareholding interfirm networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the interdependent link creation of patent and shareholding links in interfirm networks, and how this dynamics affects the resilience of such networks in the face of cascading failures. Using the Orbis dataset, we construct very large co-patenting and shareholding networks, globally as well as in terms of individual countries. Besides, we construct smaller overlap networks from those firm pairs which have both types of links between them, for nine years between 2008-2016. We use information theoretic measures, such as mutual information, active information storage, and transfer entropy, to characterise the topological similarities and shared topological information between the relevant co-patenting and shareholding networks. We then construct a cascading failure model, and use it to analyse the resilience of interdependent interfirm networks in terms of multiple failure characteristics. We find that there is relatively high level of mutual information between co-patenting networks and the shareholding networks from later years, suggesting that the formation of shareholding links is influenced by the existence of patent links in previous years. We also show that this influence becomes most apparent after a delay of four years between the formation of co-patenting links and shareholding links. Analysing the resilience of shareholding networks against cascading failures, we show that in terms of both mean downtime, and failure proportion of firms, certain countries have less resilient shareholding networks compared to other countries with significant economies. Based on our results, we postulate that an interfirm network model which considers multiple types of relationships together could be a to highlight important features of economic systems around the world.</description>

      <title>Online design of dynamic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a network (e.g., a telecommunication or transport network) is mainly done offline, in a planning phase, prior to the operation of the network. On the other hand, a massive effort has been devoted to characterizing dynamic networks, i.e., those that evolve over time. The novelty of this paper is that we introduce a method for the online design of dynamic networks. The need to do so emerges when a network needs to operate in a dynamic and stochastic environment. In this case, one may wish to build a network over time, on the fly, in order to react to the changes of the environment and to keep certain performance targets. We tackle this online design problem with a rolling horizon optimization based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. The potential of online network design is showcased for the design of a futuristic dynamic public transport network, where bus lines are constructed on the fly to better adapt to a stochastic user demand. In such a scenario, we compare our results with state-of-the-art dynamic vehicle routing problem (VRP) resolution methods, simulating requests from a New York City taxi dataset. Differently from classic VRP methods, that extend vehicle trajectories in isolation, our method enables us to build a structured network of line buses, where complex user journeys are possible, thus increasing system performance.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Social Conventions in LLM populations: Spontaneous Emergence, Collective Biases and Tipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social conventions are the foundation for social and economic life. As legions of AI agents increasingly interact with each other and with humans, their ability to form shared conventions will determine how effectively they will coordinate behaviors, integrate into society and influence it. Here, we investigate the dynamics of conventions within populations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents using simulated interactions. First, we show that globally accepted social conventions can spontaneously arise from local interactions between communicating LLMs. Second, we demonstrate how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when individual agents appear to be unbiased. Third, we examine how minority groups of committed LLMs can drive social change by establishing new social conventions. We show that once these minority groups reach a critical size, they can consistently overturn established behaviors. In all cases, contrasting the experimental results with predictions from a minimal multi-agent model allows us to isolate the specific role of LLM agents. Our results clarify how AI systems can autonomously develop norms without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align with human values and societal goals.</description>

      <title>Parrondo paradox in susceptible-infectious-susceptible dynamics over periodic temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many social and biological networks periodically change over time with daily, weekly, and other cycles. Thus motivated, we formulate and analyze susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic models over temporal networks with periodic schedules. More specifically, we assume that the temporal network consists of a cycle of alternately used static networks, each with a given duration. We observe a phenomenon in which two static networks are individually above the epidemic threshold but the alternating network composed of them renders the dynamics below the epidemic threshold, which we refer to as a Parrondo paradox for epidemics. We find that network structure plays an important role in shaping this phenomenon, and we study its dependence on the connectivity between and number of subpopulations in the network. We associate such paradoxical behavior with anti-phase oscillatory dynamics of the number of infectious individuals in different subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal bias of utility function between two-layer network for the evolution of prosocial behavior in two-order game and higher-order game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation is an important research object in economics, sociology, and biology, and the evolution of cooperation in structured populations is a interesting research topic. We mainly focus on the evolution of cooperation with two-order and higher-order game in two-layer network. We introduce a bias coefficient of utility function and study the influence of bias coefficient on the evolution of cooperation in two-layer network. We firstly provide theoretical analysis of fixation probabilities of two-order and higher-order game under weak selection in two-layer network.Secondly,based on the expression of fixation probability, we obtain the critical value of the two different games by comparing the size relationship of fixation probability under weak selection condition and neutral selection condition. Finally, by comparing the relationship between the critical value of single-layer and two-layer network in two-order game and higher-order game, when the nonlinear factor satisfies certain conditions, it is concluded that when the optimal bias coefficient tends towards 0 is met, some two-layer networks promote the evolution of cooperative behavior more than some single-layer networks.</description>

      <title>Cool Pavements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cool pavements designate alternative pavements designed to reduce their contribution to urban heating. Urban heating generally refers to the sensible heat exchanged with the atmosphere by urban materials but can also include the radiative load they impose on pedestrians. In either case, pavement surface temperature is a very important parameter, which cool pavements seek to decrease compared with standard pavement designs. The energy balance of a pavement surface or very thin pavement slab helps identify the outbound flows which cool pavements attempt to promote and fundamental physical principles which govern them. On this basis, cool pavements can be classified as reflective pavements, green and evaporative pavements, high inertia or phase changing pavements as well as conductive or heatharvesting pavements. This chapter presents the urban heat island and the urban heating phenomena and provides an overview of cool pavement technologies, detailing areas which require further scientific investigation.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Elite and Mass Polarization in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the political arena of social platforms, opposing factions of varying sizes show asymmetrical patterns, and elites and masses within these groups have divergent motivations and influence,challenging simplistic views of polarization. Yet, existing methods for quantifying polarization reduce division to a single value, assuming uniform distribution of polarization online. While this approach can confirm the observed increase in political polarization in many societies, it overlooks complexities that could explain this phenomenon. Notably, opposing groups can have unequal impacts on polarization, and the literature shows division between elites and the masses is a critical factor to consider.
  We propose a method to decompose existing polarization measures in order to quantify the role of groups, determined by these distinct hierarchies, in the total polarization value. We applied this method to polarized topics in the Finnish Twittersphere surrounding the 2019 and 2023parliamentary elections. Our analysis reveals two key insights: 1) The impact of opposing groups on observed polarization is rarely balanced, and 2) while elites strongly contribute to structural polarization and consistently display greater alignment across various topics, the masses have also recently experienced a surge in issue alignment, a stronger form of polarization.
  Our findings suggest that the masses may not be as immune to an increasingly polarized environment as previously thought. This research provides a more nuanced understanding of polarization dynamics, offering potential insights into its underlying mechanisms and evolution</description>

      <title>Mobility-GCN: a human mobility-based graph convolutional network for tracking and analyzing the spatial dynamics of the synthetic opioid crisis in the USA, 2013-2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic opioids are the most common drugs involved in drug-involved overdose mortalities in the U.S. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, about 70% of all drug overdose deaths involved opioids and 67% of all opioid-involved deaths were accounted for by synthetic opioids. In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S. We analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this period. Spatial connections and human mobility between counties were incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network model to represent and analyze the spread of synthetic opioid-involved deaths in the context of previous heroin-involved death patterns.</description>
