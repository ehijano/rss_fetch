      <title>Antibody Consumption-Driven Dynamic Competition: A Systems Hypothesis for the Transition from Acute Immune Response to Post-Infection Sequelae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms underlying the formation of post-infection sequelae are complex and remain controversial. This hypothesis integrates Bystryn's antibody feedback phenomenon and Imbiakha's immune cost theory, proposing for the first time a "Consumption-Driven Dynamic Competition of Antibody Clones" mechanism. This mechanism posits that the immune system may regulate the proliferation and differentiation of corresponding B cell clones by sensing and responding to the consumption rate of specific antibodies. This competition, driven by differences in consumption rates, might not only influence pathogen clearance efficiency and associated acute pathology during the antigen growth phase but also critically mediate the onset, development, and even resolution of post-infection sequelae during the antigen decay and homeostasis re-establishment phases. The proposed three-phase "consumption-driven dynamic competition" model provides a unified and dynamic explanatory framework for understanding the significant individual variability and dynamic evolution of post-infection immune outcomes (including the emergence and self-limitation of acute symptoms, the formation and persistence of chronic sequelae, and symptom fluctuations or resolution). It emphasizes not just specific molecules but the macroscopic dynamics of competition and selection within the immune system, offering a theoretical basis for exploring new intervention strategies for sequelae (e.g., by regulating the balance of antibody competition).</description>

      <title>Novel software for continuous wavelet analysis enable EEG real-time analysis on portable computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is frequently used for waveform analysis. For example, in the field of neuroscience research, CWT is performed to analyze electroencephalograms (EEG) and calculate the index of brain activity. Recent advancements in computer technology, such as general-purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU), have enabled the application of CWT to real-time waveform analysis. However, the computational complexity of CWT is large, and it is challenging to employ CWT as a real-time analysis method, such as in brain-machine interfaces (BMI), which require small size and cost. Therefore, a fast calculation method suitable for small and lightweight computers is desired. In this study, Python-based software for the CWT was developed and tested on portable computers. Using this software, real-time analysis of 64-electrode EEG data based on CWT was simulated and demonstrated adequate speed for the real-time analysis. Furthermore, it exhibited flexibility in performing CWT with various parameters. This software can contribute to the development of compact and lightweight BMI devices. Since CWT is a mathematical method, it may be used as a tool for other purposes.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.</description>

      <title>ProteinZero: Self-Improving Protein Generation via Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein generative models have shown remarkable promise in protein design but still face limitations in success rate, due to the scarcity of high-quality protein datasets for supervised pretraining. We present ProteinZero, a novel framework that enables scalable, automated, and continuous self-improvement of the inverse folding model through online reinforcement learning. To achieve computationally tractable online feedback, we introduce efficient proxy reward models based on ESM-fold and a novel rapid ddG predictor that significantly accelerates evaluation speed. ProteinZero employs a general RL framework balancing multi-reward maximization, KL-divergence from a reference model, and a novel protein-embedding level diversity regularization that prevents mode collapse while promoting higher sequence diversity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ProteinZero substantially outperforms existing methods across every key metric in protein design, achieving significant improvements in structural accuracy, designability, thermodynamic stability, and sequence diversity. Most impressively, ProteinZero reduces design failure rates by approximately 36% - 48% compared to widely-used methods like ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF and InstructPLM, consistently achieving success rates exceeding 90% across diverse and complex protein folds. Notably, the entire RL run on CATH-4.3 can be done with a single 8 X GPU node in under 3 days, including reward computation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein design where models evolve continuously from their own generated outputs, opening new possibilities for exploring the vast protein design space.</description>

      <title>GTR-CoT: Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought for Molecular Structure Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07553v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (1) the Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric principle of Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen, which addresses the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations, and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations, GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data.</description>

      <title>The Catechol Benchmark: Time-series Solvent Selection Data for Few-shot Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has promised to change the landscape of laboratory chemistry, with impressive results in molecular property prediction and reaction retro-synthesis. However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.</description>

Abstract: Recent successes in virtual screening have been made possible by large models and extensive chemical libraries. However, combining these elements is challenging: the larger the model, the more expensive it is to run, making ultra-large libraries unfeasible. To address this, we developed a target-agnostic, efficacy-based molecule search model, which allows us to find structurally dissimilar molecules with similar biological activities. We used the best practices to design fast retrieval system, based on processor-optimized SIMD instructions, enabling us to screen the ultra-large 40B Enamine REAL library with 100\% recall rate. We extensively benchmarked our model and several state-of-the-art models for both speed performance and retrieval quality of novel molecules.</description>

      <title>Towards an Accessible, Noninvasive Micronutrient Status Assessment Method: A Comprehensive Review of Existing Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nutrients are critical to the functioning of the human body and their imbalance can result in detrimental health concerns. The majority of nutritional literature focuses on macronutrients, often ignoring the more critical nuances of micronutrient balance, which require more precise regulation. Currently, micronutrient status is routinely assessed via complex methods that are arduous for both the patient and the clinician. To address the global burden of micronutrient malnutrition, innovations in assessment must be accessible and noninvasive. In support of this task, this article synthesizes useful background information on micronutrients themselves, reviews the state of biofluid and physiological analyses for their assessment, and presents actionable opportunities to push the field forward. By taking a unique, clinical perspective that is absent from technological research on the topic, we find that the state of the art suffers from limited clinical relevance, a lack of overlap between biofluid and physiological approaches, and highly invasive and inaccessible solutions. Future work has the opportunity to maximize the impact of a novel assessment method by incorporating clinical relevance, the holistic nature of micronutrition, and prioritizing accessible and noninvasive systems.</description>

      <title>JESTR: Joint Embedding Space Technique for Ranking Candidate Molecules for the Annotation of Untargeted Metabolomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivation: A major challenge in metabolomics is annotation: assigning molecular structures to mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Despite recent advances in molecule-to-spectra and in spectra-to-molecular fingerprint prediction (FP), annotation rates remain low. Results: We introduce in this paper a novel paradigm (JESTR) for annotation. Unlike prior approaches that explicitly construct molecular fingerprints or spectra, JESTR leverages the insight that molecules and their corresponding spectra are views of the same data and effectively embeds their representations in a joint space. Candidate structures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of query spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec and spec-to-FP annotation tools on three datasets. On average, for rank@[1-5], JESTR outperforms other tools by 23.6%-71.6%. We further demonstrate the strong value of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting rank@1 performance by 11.4% and enhancing the model's ability to discern between target and candidate molecules. When comparing JESTR's performance against that of publicly available pretrained models of SIRIUS and CFM-ID on appropriate subsets of MassSpecGym benchmark dataset, JESTR outperforms these tools by 31% and 238%, respectively. Through JESTR, we offer a novel promising avenue towards accurate annotation, therefore unlocking valuable insights into the metabolome.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Model of siRNA Endosomal Escape Mediated by Fusogenic Peptides in OVCAR-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) represents a transformative tool in cancer therapy, offering specificity and reduced off-target effects compared to conventional treatments. A crucial step in siRNA-based therapies is endosomal escape, the release of siRNA from endosomes into the cytoplasm. Quantifying endosomal escape is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the process and limitations in imaging and analytical techniques. Traditional methods often rely on fluorescence intensity measurements or manual image processing, which are time-intensive and fail to capture continuous dynamics. This paper presents a novel computational framework that integrates automated image processing to analyze time-lapse fluorescent microscopy data of endosomal escape, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and stochastic simulations. Our method employs image segmentation techniques such as binary masks, Gaussian filters, and multichannel color quantification to extract precise spatial and temporal data from microscopy images. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimate the parameters of a compartmental model that describes endosomal escape dynamics, accounting for variability over time. These parameters inform a Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm, ensuring realistic simulations of siRNA release events over time. Our framework provides a scalable and reproducible method for quantifying endosomal escape. The model captures uncertainty and variability in parameter estimation, and endosomal escape dynamics. Additionally, synthetic data generation allows researchers to validate experimental findings and explore alternative conditions without extensive laboratory work. This integrated approach not only improves the accuracy of endosomal escape quantification but also provides predictive insights for optimizing siRNA delivery systems and advancing gene therapy research.</description>

      <title>A CRISP approach to QSP: XAI enabling fit-for-purpose models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) promises to accelerate drug development, enable personalized medicine, and improve the predictability of clinical outcomes. Realizing this potential requires effectively managing the complexity of mathematical models representing biological systems. Here, we present and validate a novel QSP workflow--CRISP (Contextualized Reduction for Identifiability and Scientific Precision)--that addresses a central challenge in QSP: the problem of complexity and over-parameterization, in which models contain irrelevant parameters that obscure interpretation and hinder predictive reliability. The CRISP workflow begins with a literature-derived model, constructed to be comprehensive and unbiased by integrating prior mechanistic insights. At the core of the workflow is the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM), a reduction technique that simplifies models while preserving mechanistic structure and predictive fidelity. By applying MBAM in a context-specific manner, CRISP links parsimonious models directly to predictions of interest, clarifying causal structure and enhancing interpretability. The resulting models are computationally efficient and well-suited to key QSP tasks, including virtual population generation, experimental design, toxicology, and target discovery. We demonstrate the utility of CRISP on case studies involving the coagulation cascade and SHIV infection, and identify promising directions for improving the efficacy of bNAb therapies for HIV. Together, these results establish CRISP as a general-purpose QSP workflow for turning complex mechanistic models into tools for precise scientific reasoning to guide pharmacological and regulatory decision-making.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Denoisers Cannot Copy Graphs: Align Your Graph Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph diffusion models, dominant in graph generative modeling, remain underexplored for graph-to-graph translation tasks like chemical reaction prediction. We demonstrate that standard permutation equivariant denoisers face fundamental limitations in these tasks due to their inability to break symmetries in noisy inputs. To address this, we propose aligning input and target graphs to break input symmetries while preserving permutation equivariance in non-matching graph portions. Using retrosynthesis (i.e., the task of predicting precursors for synthesis of a given target molecule) as our application domain, we show how alignment dramatically improves discrete diffusion model performance from 5% to a SOTA-matching 54.7% top-1 accuracy.

Abstract: Purpose: Immunotherapies have revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatments. However, our understanding of response patterns in advanced cancers treated with immunotherapy remains limited. By leveraging routinely collected noninvasive longitudinal and multimodal data with artificial intelligence, we could unlock the potential to transform immunotherapy for cancer patients, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches. Methods: In this study, we developed a novel artificial neural network architecture, multimodal transformer-based simple temporal attention (MMTSimTA) network, building upon a combination of recent successful developments. We integrated pre- and on-treatment blood measurements, prescribed medications and CT-based volumes of organs from a large pan-cancer cohort of 694 patients treated with immunotherapy to predict mortality at three, six, nine and twelve months. Different variants of our extended MMTSimTA network were implemented and compared to baseline methods incorporating intermediate and late fusion based integration methods. Results: The strongest prognostic performance was demonstrated using a variant of the MMTSimTA model with area under the curves (AUCs) of $0.84 \pm $0.04, $0.83 \pm $0.02, $0.82 \pm $0.02, $0.81 \pm $0.03 for 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month survival prediction, respectively. Discussion: Our findings show that integrating noninvasive longitudinal data using our novel architecture yields an improved multimodal prognostic performance, especially in short-term survival prediction. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that multimodal longitudinal integration of noninvasive data using deep learning may offer a promising approach for personalized prognostication in immunotherapy-treated cancer patients.</description>

      <title>Fast and exact simulations of stochastic epidemics on static and temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07095</link>

Abstract: Epidemic models on complex networks have been widely used to study how the social structure of a population affect the spreading of epidemics. However, their numerical simulation can be computationally heavy, especially for large networks. In this paper, we introduce NEXT-Net: a flexible implementation of the next reaction method for epidemic spreading on both static and temporal networks. By systematic tests on artificial and real-world networks, we find that NEXT-Net is substantially faster than alternative algorithms, while being exact. It permits, in particular, to efficiently simulate epidemics on networks with million of nodes on a standard computer. It is also versatile enough to simulate a broad range of epidemic models of temporal networks, including cases in which the network structure changes in response to the epidemic. Our code is implemented in C++ and accessible from Python and R, thus combining speed with user friendliness. Because of these features, our algorithm constitutes an ideal tool for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-guided deep learning for spatiotemporal forecasting of Tuberculosis outbreak</title>

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a formidable global health challenge, driven by complex spatiotemporal transmission dynamics and influenced by factors such as population mobility and behavioral changes. We propose an Epidemic-Guided Deep Learning (EGDL) approach that fuses mechanistic epidemiological principles with advanced deep learning techniques to enhance early warning systems and intervention strategies for TB outbreaks. Our framework is built upon a modified networked Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (MN-SIR) model augmented with a saturated incidence rate and graph Laplacian diffusion, capturing both long-term transmission dynamics and region-specific population mobility patterns. Compartmental model parameters are rigorously estimated using Bayesian inference via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. Theoretical analysis leveraging the comparison principle and Green's formula establishes global stability properties of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Building on these epidemiological insights, we design two forecasting architectures, EGDL-Parallel and EGDL-Series, that integrate the mechanistic outputs of the MN-SIR model within deep neural networks. This integration mitigates the overfitting risks commonly encountered in data-driven methods and filters out noise inherent in surveillance data, resulting in reliable forecasts of real-world epidemic trends. Experiments conducted on TB incidence data from 47 prefectures in Japan and 31 provinces in mainland China demonstrate that our approach delivers robust and accurate predictions across multiple time horizons (short to medium-term forecasts), supporting its generalizability across regions with different population dynamics.</description>

      <title>InfoSEM: A Deep Generative Model with Informative Priors for Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from gene expression data is crucial for understanding biological processes. While supervised models are reported to achieve high performance for this task, they rely on costly ground truth (GT) labels and risk learning gene-specific biases, such as class imbalances of GT interactions, rather than true regulatory mechanisms. To address these issues, we introduce InfoSEM, an unsupervised generative model that leverages textual gene embeddings as informative priors, improving GRN inference without GT labels. InfoSEM can also integrate GT labels as an additional prior when available, avoiding biases and further enhancing performance. Additionally, we propose a biologically motivated benchmarking framework that better reflects real-world applications such as biomarker discovery and reveals learned biases of existing supervised methods. InfoSEM outperforms existing models by 38.5% across four datasets using textual embeddings prior and further boosts performance by 11.1% when integrating labeled data as priors.</description>

      <title>Protap: A Benchmark for Protein Modeling on Realistic Downstream Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02052</link>

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally, domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically, Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Trust-App-AI-Lab/protap.</description>
