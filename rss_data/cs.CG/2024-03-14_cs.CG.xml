      <title>Computing Generalized Ranks of Persistence Modules via Unfolding to Zigzag Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $P$-indexed persistence module ${\sf M}$, the (generalized) rank of ${\sf M}$ is defined as the rank of the limit-to-colimit map for ${\sf M}$ over the poset $P$. For $2$-parameter persistence modules, recently a zigzag persistence based algorithm has been proposed that takes advantage of the fact that generalized rank for $2$-parameter modules is equal to the number of full intervals in a zigzag module defined on the boundary of the poset. Analogous definition of boundary for $d$-parameter persistence modules or general $P$-indexed persistence modules does not seem plausible. To overcome this difficulty, we first unfold a given $P$-indexed module ${\sf M}$ into a zigzag module ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ and then check how many full interval modules in a decomposition of ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ can be folded back to remain full in ${\sf M}$. This number determines the generalized rank of ${\sf M}$. For special cases of degree-$d$ homology for $d$-complexes, we obtain a more efficient algorithm including a linear time algorithm for degree-$1$ homology in graphs.</description>

      <title>Terminal Embeddings in Sublinear Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently (Elkin, Filtser, Neiman 2017) introduced the concept of a {\it terminal embedding} from one metric space $(X,d_X)$ to another $(Y,d_Y)$ with a set of designated terminals $T\subset X$. Such an embedding $f$ is said to have distortion $\rho\ge 1$ if $\rho$ is the smallest value such that there exists a constant $C&gt;0$ satisfying
  \begin{equation*}
  \forall x\in T\ \forall q\in X,\ C d_X(x, q) \le d_Y(f(x), f(q)) \le C \rho d_X(x, q) .
  \end{equation*}
  When $X,Y$ are both Euclidean metrics with $Y$ being $m$-dimensional, recently (Narayanan, Nelson 2019), following work of (Mahabadi, Makarychev, Makarychev, Razenshteyn 2018), showed that distortion $1+\epsilon$ is achievable via such a terminal embedding with $m = O(\epsilon^{-2}\log n)$ for $n := |T|$. This generalizes the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which only preserves distances within $T$ and not to $T$ from the rest of space. The downside of prior work is that evaluating their embedding on some $q\in \mathbb{R}^d$ required solving a semidefinite program with $\Theta(n)$ constraints in~$m$ variables and thus required some superlinear $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ runtime. Our main contribution in this work is to give a new data structure for computing terminal embeddings. We show how to pre-process $T$ to obtain an almost linear-space data structure that supports computing the terminal embedding image of any $q\in\mathbb{R}^d$ in sublinear time $O^* (n^{1-\Theta(\epsilon^2)} + d)$. To accomplish this, we leverage tools developed in the context of approximate nearest neighbor search.</description>

      <title>Spectral Meets Spatial: Harmonising 3D Shape Matching and Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18920v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although 3D shape matching and interpolation are highly interrelated, they are often studied separately and applied sequentially to relate different 3D shapes, thus resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this work we present a unified framework to predict both point-wise correspondences and shape interpolation between 3D shapes. To this end, we combine the deep functional map framework with classical surface deformation models to map shapes in both spectral and spatial domains. On the one hand, by incorporating spatial maps, our method obtains more accurate and smooth point-wise correspondences compared to previous functional map methods for shape matching. On the other hand, by introducing spectral maps, our method gets rid of commonly used but computationally expensive geodesic distance constraints that are only valid for near-isometric shape deformations. Furthermore, we propose a novel test-time adaptation scheme to capture both pose-dominant and shape-dominant deformations. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for both shape matching and interpolation, even compared to supervised approaches.</description>
