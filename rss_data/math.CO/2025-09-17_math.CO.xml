      <title>On the Diminished Sombor Index of Fixed-Order Molecular Graphs With Cyclomatic Number at Least 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ with edge set $E$, let $d(u)$ denote the degree of a vertex $u$ in $G$. The diminished Sombor (DSO) index of $G$ is defined as $DSO(G)=\sum_{uv\in E}\sqrt{(d(u))^2+(d(v))^2}(d(u)+d(v))^{-1}$. The cyclomatic number of a graph is the smallest number of edges whose removal makes the graph acyclic. A connected graph of maximum degree at most $4$ is known as a molecular graph. The primary motivation of the present study comes from a conjecture concerning the minimum DSO index of fixed-order connected graphs with cyclomatic number $3$, posed in the recent paper [F. Movahedi, I. Gutman, I. Red\v{z}epovi\'c, B. Furtula, Diminished Sombor index, MATCH Commun. Comput. Chem. 95 (2026) 141--162]. The present paper gives all graphs minimizing the DSO index among all molecular graphs of order $n$ with cyclomatic number $\ell$, provided that $n\ge 2(\ell-1)\ge4$.</description>

      <title>Spectra of T-vertex and T-edge neighbourhood corona of Two Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $T$-graph $T(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are the vertices and edges of $G$, with two vertices of $T(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding elements of $G$ are adjacent or incident. In this paper, we determine the adjacency and Laplacian spectra of $T$-vertex neighborhood corona and $T$-edge neighborhood corona of a connected regular graph with an arbitrary regular graph in terms of their eigenvalues. Moreover, applying these results we construct some non-regular $A$-cospectral and $L$-cospectral graphs.</description>

      <title>Toroidal Cartesian Products Where One Factor is 3-Connected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a partial classification of Cartesian products of graphs that embed on the torus where one factor is $3$-connected. We show that if $G \square H$ embeds on the torus and $G$ is $3$-connected, then $H$ must be a path on two vertices, $P_2$, and we provide significant evidence that $G$ must be outer-cylindrical. At the same time, we show that if $G$ is outer-cylindrical, then $G \square P_2$ embeds on the torus. This all leads us to conjecture that if $G$ is $3$-connected then $G \square H$ embeds on the torus if and only if $G$ is outer-cylindrical and $H = P_2$. We also determine the genera of $K_{4} \square P_{3}$ and $H_i \square P_2$ where $H_i$ is a planar, $3$-connected, non-outer-cylindrical graph derived from a wheel graph $W_i$ via two vertex splits and one edge addition.</description>

Abstract: We present a counter-example to the statement that there is a linear reduction in both directionsbetween the largest common subtree and the smallest common supertrees. Moreover, we show that in general, even having of one of them, it is necessery to calculate the other from the linear number of nodes.</description>

      <title>An averaging result for union-closed families of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a union-closed family of sets with base set $b(\mathcal{A})=\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$ denoted by $[n]=\{1, \cdots, n\}$, and for any real $x&gt;0$, let $\mathcal{A}_{&lt;x} = \{A \in \mathcal{A} \ | \ |A| &lt; x\}$. Also, denote by $\mathcal{B}$ any smallest irredundant subfamily of $\mathcal{A}_{&lt;n/2}$ such that $b(\mathcal{B})=b(\mathcal{A}_{&lt;n/2})$. We prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ is separating with height $h = 4 \leq n$ and $0 \leq |\mathcal{B}| \leq 2$, then the average size of a member set from $\mathcal{A}$ is at least $n/2$. We show that $h=4$ is greatest possible with respect to this result, and conclude by considering the remaining domain $3 \leq |\mathcal{B}| \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on proper conflict-free degree-choosability of graphs with prescribed degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ is called a proper conflict-free coloring of $G$ if for every non-isolated vertex $v$ of $G$, there is a color $c$ such that $|\phi^{-1}(c)\cap N_G(v)|=1$. As an analogy of degree-choosability of graphs, we introduced the notion of proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs. For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable if for any list assignment $L$ of $G$ with $|L(v)|\geq d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$, $G$ admits a proper conflict-free coloring $\phi$ such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$. In this note, we first remark if a graph $G$ is $d$-degenerate, then $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+d+1)$-choosable. Furthermore, when $d=1$, we can reduce the number of colors by showing that every tree is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+1)$-choosable. This motivates us to state a question.</description>

      <title>Sharp lower bounds and extremal graphs for the generalized $k$-independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex set $S$ is a generalized $k$-independent set if the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains no tree on $k$ vertices. The generalized $k$-independence number $\alpha_k(G)$ is the maximum size of such a set. For a tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, Bock et al. [J. Graph Theory 103 (2023) 661-673] and Li et al. [Taiwanese J. Math. 27 (2023) 647-683] independently showed that $\alpha_3(G)\geq \frac{2}{3}n$ and identified the extremal trees that attain this lower bound. Subsequently, Li and Zhou [Appl. Math. Comput. 484 (2025) 129018] established that $\alpha_4(T) \geq \frac{3}{4}n$ and they further characterized all trees achieving this bound. This result was recently extended by Huang, who proved that $\alpha_4(G)\geq \frac{3}{4}(n-\omega(G))$ holds for every $n$-vertex graph, where $\omega(G)$ denotes the dimension of the cycle space of $G.$ The extremal graphs attaining this lower bound were also fully characterized. Based on these findings, Huang proposed a conjecture concerning a lower bound for $\alpha_k(G)\ (k\geq2)$ together with the corresponding extremal graphs, which naturally generalizes all the aforementioned results. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture here. We further quantify strict improvements over this bound when the equality conditions fail, and we provide a linear-time algorithm that constructs a generalized $k$-independent set of size at least $\left\lceil\frac{k-1}{k}\left(n-\omega(G)\right)\right\rceil$.</description>

      <title>The Insertion Chain Complex: A Topological Approach to the Structure of Word Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Insertion Chain Complex, a higher-dimensional extension of insertion graphs, as a new framework for analyzing finite sets of words. We study its topological and combinatorial properties, in particular its homology groups, as measures of the complexity for word sets. After establishing its theoretical foundations, we investigate the computational and combinatorial aspects of these complexes. Among other results, we classify minimal 1-dimensional cycles and prove that every finitely generated abelian group can be realized as the homology of the insertion complex for some set of words. We also identify conditions that guarantee vanishing homology. These results provide new invariants for characterizing finite sets of words through word-based topological structures and their properties.</description>

      <title>Tricyclic graphs for which the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph with vertex set $V(G)=\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}\}$. The distance $d_G(v_i,v_j)$ between two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ of $G$ is the length of a shortest path between $v_i$ and $v_j$. The distance matrix of $G$ is defined as $D(G)=(d_G(v_i,v_j))_{n\times n}$. The second largest distance eigenvalue of \( G \) is the second largest eigenvalues of $D(G)$. Guo and Zhou [Discrete Math. 347(2024), 114082] proved that any connected graph with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$ is chordal, and characterize all bicyclic graphs and split graphs with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$. Based on this, we characterize all tricyclic graphs with the second largest distance eigenvalue less than $-\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Finite Ordered Sets from Higher Exponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the finite ordered sets $A, D$, write $A^D$ for the ordered set of isotone maps $D \to A$ with the pointwise order. It was proved in earlier work that the order structure of $A^A$ determines~$A$ up to isomorphism. In this note we extend the result to higher function ordered sets such as $A^{(A^A)}$ and $(A^A)^A$. Our main theorem shows that the structure of $A^D$ determines~$A$.</description>

Abstract: Andrews and El Bachraoui recently studied various two-colored integer partitions, including those related to two-colored partitions into distinct parts with constraints and overpartitions. Their work raised questions about the existence of combinatorial proofs for these results, which were partially addressed by the first author and Zou. This paper provides combinatorial proofs for the remaining results concerning two-colored partitions and overpartitions with constraints.</description>

      <title>Stoimenow matchings avoiding multiple Catalan patterns simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Vassiliev's knot invariants, Stoimenow introduced a special class of matchings, now known as Stoimenow matchings. These matchings have since been linked to various combinatorial structures enumerated by the Fishburn numbers. In a recent paper, a problem posed by Bevan et al. was addressed concerning the identification of subsets of Stoimenow matchings counted by the Catalan numbers. Five such subsets were presented, each defined by the avoidance of a single pattern, referred to as a Catalan pattern, within Stoimenow matchings.
  In the present paper, we extend this line of research by enumerating all cases of simultaneous avoidance of sets of Catalan patterns in Stoimenow matchings. This comprehensive analysis reveals connections to nine integer sequences listed in the OEIS.</description>

      <title>The Power Contamination Problem on Grids Revisited: Optimality, Combinatorics, and Links to Integer Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12756v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a combinatorial study of the power contamination problem, a dynamic variant of power domination modeled on grid graphs. We resolve a conjecture posed by Ainouche and Bouroubi (2021) by proving it is false and instead establish the exact value of the power contamination number on grid graphs. Furthermore, we derive recurrence relations for this number and initiate the enumeration of optimal contamination sets. We prove that the number of optimal solutions for specific grid families corresponds to well-known integer sequences, including those counting ternary words with forbidden subwords and the large Schr\"oder numbers. This work settles the fundamental combinatorial questions of the power contamination problem on grids and reveals its rich connections to classical combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: For $p&gt;0$ a small parameter, let $\mathcal A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;0}$ be a random subset where each positive integer is included independently with probability $p$. We show that, with high probability (as $p \to 0$), the numerical semigroup $\langle\mathcal A\rangle:=\{a_1+\cdots+a_k: k \geq 0, a_1, \ldots, a_k \in \mathcal A\}$ generated by $\mathcal A$ has Frobenius number and genus of size $\asymp p^{-1}(\log p^{-1})^2$ and embedding dimension of size $\asymp (\log p^{-1})^2$. This resolves an open problem of Bogart and the second author.</description>

      <title>An involution for trivariate symmetries of vincular patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a bijective proof of the equidistribution of two pairs of vincular patterns in permutations, thereby resolving a recent open problem of Bitonti, Deb, and Sokal (arXiv:2412.10214). Since the bijection is involutive, we also confirm their conjecture on the equidistribution of triple vincular patterns. Somewhat unexpectedly, we show that this involution is closed on the set of Baxter permutations, thereby implying another trivariate symmetries of vincular patterns. The proof of this second result requires a variant of a characterization of Baxter permutations in terms of restricted Laguerre histories, first given by Viennot using the Fran\c{c}on-Viennot bijection.</description>

      <title>New Helly-type results for discrete boxes: Quantitative colorful and $(p,q)$-variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2008, Halman showed that for any finite set $P\subset \mathbb R^d$ and any finite family $\mathcal{B}$ of axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if the intersection of $P$ and any subfamily $\mathcal{B}' \subseteq\mathcal{B}$ of size at most $2d$ is non-empty, then the intersection of $P$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is also non-empty. Very recently Edwards and Sober\'on initiated the study of quantitative colorful version for $2d$ families, $(p,q)$-type variation for $p\geq q\geq d+1$, and other extensions of this Helly-type result by Halman.
  In this paper, we study the quantitative colorful Halman problem for $2d-1$ families as well its $(p,q)$-type variation for $p\geq q\geq 2$. Specifically, our main result asserts that for any finite set $P$ and finite families of boxes $\mathcal{B}_1,\dots,\mathcal{B}_{2d-1}$ in $\mathbb R^d$, where $d\geq 2$, if every transversal $\mathcal{B}$ for the families has an intersection $\bigcap \mathcal{B}$ containing at least $n$ points of $P$, then there exist $j\in[2d-1]$ and a subset of $P$ of size at most \[ 2n+\Big\lfloor \frac{n-1}{d \cdot 2^{d-1}} \Big\rfloor, \] such that each box of $\mathcal{B}_j$ contains at least $n$ points of this subset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article, written for undergraduate mathematics students, provides an accessible introduction to a few key problems in tiling theory: Heesch's problem, the isohedral number problem, and the existence of an aperiodic monotile. I contributed to the solution of the last of these problems in 2023, but many related questions remain open and worthy of study. My goal is to get more students excited about studying tiling theory.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture of Garvan and Jennings-Shaffer on the nonnegativity of M_{C1}(m,n) and M_{C5}(m,n)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their 2016 paper on exotic Bailey--Slater SPT-functions, Garvan and Jennings-Shaffer introduced many new spt-crank-type functions and proposed a conjecture that the spt-crank-type functions $M_{C1}(m,n)$ and $M_{C5}(m,n)$ are both nonnegative for all $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}.$ Applying Wright\textquoteright s circle method, Jang and Kim showed that $M_{C1}(m,n)$ and $M_{C5}(m,n)$ are both positive for a fixed integer $m$ and large enough integers $n.$ Up to now, no complete proof of this conjecture has been given. In this paper, we provide a complete proof for this conjecture by using the theory of lattice points. Our proof is quite different from that of Jang and Kim.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12656v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the labelled growth rate of an $\omega$-categorical structure $\mathfrak{A}$, i.e., the number of orbits of $Aut(\mathfrak{A})$ on $n$-tuples of distinct elements, and show that the model-theoretic property of monadic stability yields a gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates. As a further application, we obtain gap in the spectrum of allowable labelled growth rates in hereditary graph classes, with no a priori assumption of $\omega$-categoricity. We also establish a way to translate results about labelled growth rates of $\omega$-categorical structures into combinatorial statements about sets with weak finiteness properties in the absence of the axiom of choice, and derive several results from this translation.</description>

      <title>On the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture in Characteristics $\ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short).
  $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.
  The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.This leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $\ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their full determination.</description>

      <title>Between proportionnality and envy-freeness: k-proportionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the cake cutting problem. In this setting, there exists two notions of fair division: proportional division (when there are n players, each player thinks to get at least 1/n of the cake) and envy-free division (each player wants to keep his or her share because he or she does not envy the portion given to another player). Some results are valid for proportional division but not for envy-free division.  Here, we introduce and study a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The goal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional division and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in this article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the proportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With k-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division lie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no k-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This result was known only for envy-free division, ie k = 2. Next, we prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal k-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This result was known only for k = 2. These theorems say that we can get an impossibility result even if we do not consider an envy-free division but a weaker notion. Finally, k-proportionality allows to give a generalization with a uniform statement of theorems about strong envy-free and strong proportional divisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Lie characters form a distinguished family of symmetric group characters, which appear in many areas of algebra and combinatorics. An old open problem of Thrall is to decompose them into irreducibles. We propose a novel asymptotic approach to this problem, showing that many families of higher Lie characters tend to be proportional to the regular character. In particular, a random higher Lie character tends, in probability, to be proportional to the regular character.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</description>

      <title>Parities in random Latin squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Latin square, every row can be interpreted as a permutation, and therefore has a parity (even or odd). We prove that in a uniformly random $n\times n$ Latin square, the $n$ row parities are very well approximated by a sequence of $n$ independent unbiased coin flips: for example, the total variation error of this approximation tends to zero as $n\to\infty$. This resolves a conjecture of Cameron. In fact, we prove a generalisation of Cameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column parities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between rows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).
  Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of random Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable intercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin squares with a certain independent model.</description>

Abstract: The study of modular representation theory of the double covering groups of the symmetric and alternating groups reveals rich and subtle combinatorial and algebraic phenomena involving their irreducible characters and the structure of their p-blocks, where p is an odd prime number. In this paper, we investigate the action of certain Galois automorphisms, those that act on p'-roots of unity by a power of p, on spin characters, with an emphasis on their interaction with perfect isometries and block theory. In particular, we prove that perfect isometries constructed by the first author and J.\,B. Gramain in \cite{BrGr3}, which were used to establish a weaker form of the Kessar--Schaps conjecture, remain preserved under this Galois action whenever certain natural compatibility conditions occur.</description>

      <title>Signature 0 toric varieties, wall crossings, and cross polytope-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a gamma vector equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is expected that the cases where the gamma vector is 0 form ``building blocks'' among those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood.
  For such toric varieties, we address this situation using wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these ``anchoring'' linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles expected to cover the minimal objects described above.</description>

Abstract: We seek simple conditions on a pair of labeled posets that determine when the difference of their $(P,\omega)$-partition enumerators is $F$-positive, i.e., positive in Gessel's fundamental basis. This is a quasisymmetric analogue of the extensively studied problem of finding conditions on a pair of skew shapes that determine when the difference of their skew Schur functions is Schur-positive. We determine necessary conditions and separate sufficient conditions for $F$-positivity, and show that a broad operation for combining posets preserves positivity properties. We conclude with classes of posets for which we have conditions that are both necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <title>Circuit-partition of infinite matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Komj\'ath, Milner, and Polat investigated when a finitary matroid admits a partition into circuits. They defined the class of ``finite matching extendable'' matroids and showed in their compactness theorem that those matroids always admit such a partition. Their proof is based on Shelah's singular compactness technique and a careful analysis of certain $\triangle$-systems.
  We provide a short, simple proof of their theorem. Then we show that a finitary binary oriented matroid can be partitioned into directed circuits if and only if, in every cocircuit, the cardinality of the negative and positive edges is the same. This generalizes an earlier conjecture of Thomassen, settled affirmatively by the second author, about partitioning the edges of an infinite directed graph into directed cycles. As side results, a Laviolette theorem for finitary matroids and a Farkas lemma for finitary binary oriented matroids are proven. An example is given to show that, in contrast to finite oriented matroids, `binary' is essential in the latter result.</description>

      <title>Equitable coloring of sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper coloring where the sizes of any two distinct color classes differ by at most one. The celebrated Chen-Lih-Wu Conjecture (CLWC for short) states that every connected graph $G$ that is neither an odd cycle, a $K_r$, nor a $K_{2m+1,2m+1}$ has an equitable $\Delta(G)$-coloring. A graph $G$ is in $\mathcal{G}_{m_1,m_2}$ if for all $H\subseteq G$, $\lVert H \rVert\leq m_1|H|$, and if $H$ is bipartite, then $\lVert H \rVert\leq m_2|H|$. In this paper, we confirm CLWC for all graphs $G$ in $\mathcal{G}_{m_1, m_2}$ provided that $m_1\leq 1.8m_2$ and $\Delta(G)\geq \frac{2m_1}{1-\beta}$, where $\beta$ is a real root of $2m_2(1-x)(1+x)^2-m_1x(2+x)$. By specializing to the case $m_1 = m_2 = d$, we deduce that every $d$-degenerate graph $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 6.21d$ admits an equitable $r$-coloring for all $r \geq \Delta(G)$, thereby improving the previous best-known lower bound of $10d$ on $\Delta(G)$ established by Kostochka and Nakprasit in 2005. A graph is $k$-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that each edge is crossed at most $k$ times. CLWC had been confirmed for planar graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 8$ (Kostochka, Lin, and Xiang, 2024) and for $1$-planar graphs $G$ with $\Delta(G) \geq 13$ (Cranston and Mahmoud, 2025). As an immediate application of our main result, we extend this confirmation to all $k$-planar graphs $G$ with $k \geq 2$ and $\Delta(G) \geq \sqrt{383k}$.</description>

Abstract: Recent work of the author connected several parking function enumeration problems to enumerations of Catalan paths with respect to certain weight functions that are expressed in terms of the ascent lengths. Motivated by this, we generalise and solve analogous weighted enumeration problems for a large family of lattice paths and weight functions, and discuss their connections with other enumeration problems and OEIS entries.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of $\nu$-associahedra via brick polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brick polytopes constitute a remarkable family of polytopes associated to the spherical subword complexes of Knutson and Miller. They were introduced for finite Coxeter groups by Pilaud and Stump, who used them to produce geometric realizations of generalized associahedra arising from the theory of cluster algebras of finite types. In this paper, we present an application of the vast generalization of brick polyhedra for general subword complexes (not necessarily spherical) recently introduced by Jahn and Stump.
  More precisely, we show that the $\nu$-associahedron, a polytopal complex whose edge graph is the Hasse diagram of the $\nu$-Tamari lattice introduced by Pr\'eville-Ratelle and Viennot, can be geometrically realized as the complex of bounded faces of the brick polyhedron of a well chosen subword complex. We also present a suitable projection to the appropriate dimension, which leads to an elegant vertex-coordinate description.</description>

      <title>On walk domination: Between different types of walks and $m_3$-path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two non-adjacent vertices \( u \) and \( v \), we say a $uv$-walk \( W \) dominates a $uv$-walk \( W' \) if every internal vertex of \( W' \) is adjacent to some internal vertex of \( W \) or belongs to \( W \). A class of walks \(\mathbf{A}\) dominates a class of walks \(\mathbf{B}\) if for every pair of non-adjacent vertices $u,v$ in the graph, every $uv$-walk in \(\mathbf{A}\) dominates every $uv$-walk in \(\mathbf{B}\). This paper investigates the domination relationships among various types of walks connecting two non-adjacent vertices in a graph. In particular, we focus on the problem which is proposed in [S. B. Tondato, Graphs Combin. 40 (2024)]. We study the domination between different walk types (shortest paths, toll walks, weakly toll walks, $l_k$-paths for $k\in \left\{2,3\right\}$) and $m_3$-paths. And we show how these relationships give rise to characterizations of graph classes.</description>

      <title>Chordality and Shellability of Higher Independence Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $r$-independence complex $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ and its associated hypergraph $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ from combinatorial and algebraic perspectives. We demonstrate that contrary to previous claims, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ need not be chordal even when $G$ is a tree, providing explicit counterexamples. Our results establish precise conditions for chordality across several graph classes: for cycles $C_n$, $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ is chordal exactly when $n-2 \leq r \leq n-1$; for forests, chordality holds when $r \geq n-5$; and for block graphs, $\mathcal{C}_2(G)$ is always chordal. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{C}_r(G)$ remains chordal for all $r \geq 2$ in graphs with diameter constraints. The shellability of $\mathcal{I}_r(G)$ is proved through three fundamental constructions: star-clique attachments to vertex covers, generalized whiskering operations that preserve shellability under size constraints, and cyclic clique arrangements where shellability depends critically on attachment sizes. These results collectively generalize existing work on shellable independence complexes to the broader setting of higher independence complexes, revealing new connections between graph structure, hypergraph chordality, and algebraic properties of associated ideals.</description>

      <title>The Converse of the Real Orthogonal Holant Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of symmetric tensors.</description>

      <title>Parameterised algorithms for temporally satisfying reconfiguration problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporally satisfying reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph at each time-step.
  We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input temporal graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.</description>

      <title>Compression and complexity for sumset sizes in additive number theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of sums of finite sets of integers has mostly concentrated on sets with small sumsets (Freiman's theorem and related work) and on sets with large sumsets (Sidon sets and $B_h$-sets). This paper considers the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$ of \emph{all} sizes of $h$-fold sums of sets of $k$ integers or of $k$ lattice points, and the geometric and computational complexity of the sets ${\mathcal R}_{\mathbf Z}(h,k)$ and ${\mathcal R}_{{\mathbf Z}^n}(h,k)$. For sumsets $hA$ with large diameter, there is a compression algorithm to construct sets $A'$ with $|hA'| = |hA|$ and small diameter.</description>

Abstract: Let X1, ..., Xn be arbitrary non-negative independent random variables with respective expected values $\mu_{i}$ at most one. We sketch but do not prove an equivalent conjecture to Feige's Conjecture $\mathbb{P} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} &lt; \mu + 1 \right) \geq \exp \left(-1 \right)$, where $\mu$ is the expected value of the sum of the random variables. We show by a simple example how this inequality finds use in mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>On integers with many representations as the sum of $k$th powers of primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a natural number $k&gt;1$, let $f_k(n)$ denote the number of distinct representations of a natural number $n$ of the form $p^k+q^k$ for primes $p,q$. We prove that, for all $k&gt;1$,
  $$\limsup_{n\to\infty}f_k(n)=\infty.$$
  This positively answers a conjecture of Erdos, which asks if there are natural numbers $n$ with arbitrarily many distinct representations of the form $p_1^k+p_2^k+\dots+p_k^k$ for primes $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_k$.</description>
