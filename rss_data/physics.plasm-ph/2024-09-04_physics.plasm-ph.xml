      <title>A fast solver for the spatially homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical method for the velocity-space, spatially homogeneous, collisional Boltzmann equation for electron transport in low-temperature plasma (LTP) conditions. Modeling LTP plasmas is useful in many applications, including advanced manufacturing, material processing, semiconductor processing, and hypersonics, to name a few. Most state-of-the-art methods for electron kinetics are based on Monte-Carlo sampling for collisions combined with Lagrangian particle-in-cell methods. We discuss an Eulerian solver that approximates the electron velocity distribution function using spherical harmonics (angular components) and B-splines (energy component). Our solver supports electron-heavy elastic and inelastic binary collisions, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, steady-state and transient dynamics, and an arbitrary nmber of angular terms in the electron distribution function. We report convergence results and compare our solver to two other codes: an in-house particle Monte-Carlo ethod; and Bolsig+, a state-of-the-art Eulerian solver for electron transport in LTPs. Furthermore, we use our solver to study the relaxation time scales of the higher-order anisotropic correction terms. Our code is open-source and provides an interface that allows coupling to multiphysics simulations of low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>Exploring novel compact quasi-axisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new class of compact quasi-axisymmetric stellarators with a wide range of field periods offers the unique potential to combine the advantages of the two leading magnetic confinement fusion devices, tokamaks and stellarators. Here we present the first numerical optimization of this class which has so far only been obtained analytically. Our approach finds significantly improved quasi-axisymmetric equilibria at aspect ratio $&lt; 2.5$, resulting in no losses of alpha particles at reactor volume while also satisfying improved magnetohydrodynamic stability and a self-consistent plasma current.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning to Design High Aspect Ratio Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of fusion devices is typically based on computationally expensive simulations. This can be alleviated using high aspect ratio models that employ a reduced number of free parameters, especially in the case of stellarator optimization where non-axisymmetric magnetic fields with a large parameter space are optimized to satisfy certain performance criteria. However, optimization is still required to find configurations with properties such as low elongation, high rotational transform, finite plasma beta, and good fast particle confinement. In this work, we train a machine learning model to construct configurations with favorable confinement properties by finding a solution to the inverse design problem, that is, obtaining a set of model input parameters for given desired properties. Since the solution of the inverse problem is non-unique, a probabilistic approach, based on mixture density networks, is used. It is shown that optimized configurations can be generated reliably using this method.</description>

      <title>Ionisation Calculations using Classical Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By performing an ensemble of molecular dynamics simulations, the model-dependent ionisation state is computed for strongly interacting systems self-consistently. This is accomplished through a free energy minimisation framework based on the technique of thermodynamic integration. To illustrate the method, two simple models applicable to partially ionised hydrogen plasma are presented in which pair potentials are employed between ions and neutral particles. Within the models, electrons are either bound in the hydrogen ground state or distributed in a uniform charge-neutralising background. Particular attention is given to the transition between atomic gas and ionised plasma, where the effect of neutral interactions is explored beyond commonly used models in the chemical picture. Furthermore, pressure ionisation is observed when short range repulsion effects are included between neutrals. The developed technique is general, and we discuss the applicability to a variety of molecular dynamics models for partially ionised warm dense matter.</description>

      <title>Including the vacuum field energy in stellarator coil design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being ``three-dimensional'', stellarators have the advantage that plasma currents are not essential for creating rotational-transform; however, the external current-carrying coils in stellarators are usually not planar.
  Reducing the inter-coil electromagnetic forces acting on strongly shaped 3D coils while preserving the favorable properties of the ``target'' magnetic field is a design challenge.
  In this work, we recognize that the inter-coil ${\mathbf j} \times {\mathbf B}$ forces are the gradient of the vacuum magnetic energy, $\displaystyle E := \frac{1}{2\mu_0}\int_{R^3} \!\!\! B^2 \, dV$.
  We introduce an objective functional, ${\cal F}\equiv \Phi_2 + \omega E$, built on the usual quadratic flux on a prescribed target surface, $\displaystyle \Phi_2 := \frac{1}{2}\int_{\cal S} ( {\mathbf B} \cdot {\mathbf n} )^2 \, dS$, and the vacuum energy, where $\omega$ is a weight penalty.
  The Euler-Lagrange equation for stationary states is derived, and numerical illustrations are computed using the SIMSOPT code \cite{simsopt}.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to universal non-Maxwellian equilibria in a collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic equilibria are derived for turbulent relaxing plasmas via an entropy-maximization procedure that accounts for the short-time conservation of certain collisionless invariants. The conservation of these collisionless invariants endows the system with a partial `memory' of its prior conditions, but is imperfect on long time scales due to the development of a turbulent cascade to small scales, which breaks the precise conservation of phase volume, making this memory imprecise. The equilibria are still determined by the short-time collisionless invariants, but the invariants themselves are driven to a universal form by the nature of the turbulence. This is numerically confirmed for the case of beam instabilities in one-dimensional electrostatic plasmas, where sufficiently strong turbulence appears to cause the distribution function of particle energies to develop a universal power-law tail, with exponent -2.</description>

      <title>Strain Optimization for ReBCO High-Temperature Superconducting Stellarator Coils in SIMSOPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides an optimization mechanism to ensure the compatibility of ReBCO (Rare-earth Barium Copper Oxide) high-temperature superconducting (HTS) tapes with non-planar stellarator coils. ReBCO coils enable higher field strengths and operating temperatures for the magnet systems of future fusion reactors but are sensitive to strain due to their brittle, ceramic functional layer. We have implemented a metric to optimize strain on stellarator coils made from ReBCO superconductors into the stellarator optimization framework \texttt{SIMSOPT} and used it to design new stellarator coil configurations. To ensure structural integrity of coils wound with HTS tape, we introduce a penalty on binormal curvature and torsion along a coil. It can be used to optimize the orientation of the winding path for a given coil filament or to jointly optimize orientation and coil filament. We apply the strain optimization to three cases. For the EPOS (Electrons and Positrons in an Optimized Stellarator) design, we combine the strain penalty with an objective for quasisymmetry into a single-stage optimization; this enables us to find a configuration with excellent quasisymmetry at the smallest possible size compatible with the use of ReBCO tape. For CSX (Columbia Stellarator eXperiment), in addition to HTS strain, we add a penalty to prevent net tape rotation to ease the coil winding process. If the strain is calculated for a coil at reactor scale, we find a considerable variation of the binormal and torsional strain over the cross section of the large winding pack (0.5\,m x 0.5\,m). By exploiting the overall orientation of the winding pack as a degree of freedom, we can reduce binormal and torsional strains below limits for every ReBCO stack.</description>

      <title>Earth's Alfv\'{e}n Wings: Unveiling Dynamic Variations of Field-line Topologies with Electron Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic cloud (MC) of the Coronal Mass Ejection on April 24, 2023, contains sub-Alfv\'{e}nic solar wind, transforming Earth's magnetosphere from conventional bow-shock magnetotail configuration to Alfv\'{e}n wings. Utilizing measurements from the Magnetosphere Multiscale (MMS) mission, we present for the first time electron distribution signatures as the spacecraft traverses through various magnetic topologies during this transformation. Specifically, we characterize electrons inside the sub-Alfv\'{e}nic MC, on the dawn-dusk wing field lines and on the closed field lines. The signatures include strahl electrons in MC regions and energetic keV electrons streaming along the dawn and dusk wing field lines. We demonstrate the distribution signatures of dual wing reconnection, defined as reconnection between dawn-dusk Alfv\'{e}n wing field lines and the IMF. These signatures include four electron populations comprised of partially-depleted MC electrons and bi-directional energetic electrons with variations in energy and pitch-angle. The distributions reveal evidence of bursty magnetic reconnection under northward IMF.</description>

      <title>In situ observations of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves heating and accelerating the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After leaving the Sun's corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecrafts to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, in connection to the presence of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. Alfv\'en waves are perturbations in the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. Our calculations show the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\'en waves is sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Review of the August 1972 and March 1989 Space Weather Events: Can We Learn Anything New From Them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Updated summaries of the August 1972 and March 1989 space weather events have been constructed. The features of these two events are compared to the Carrington 1859 event and a few other major space weather events. It is concluded that solar active regions release energy in a variety of forms (X-rays, EUV photons, visible light, coronal mass ejection (CME) plasmas and fields) and they in turn can produce other energetic effects (solar energetic particles (SEPs), magnetic storms) in a variety of ways. It is clear that there is no strong one-to-one relationship between these various energy sinks. The energy is often distributed differently from one space weather event to the next. Concerning SEPs accelerated at interplanetary CME (ICME) shocks, it is concluded that the Fermi mechanism associated with quasi-parallel shocks is relatively weak and that the gradient drift mechanism (electric fields) at quasi-perpendicular shocks will produce harder spectra and higher fluxes. If the 4 Augusut 1972 intrinsic magnetic cloud condition (southward interplanetary magnetic field instead of northward) and the interplanetary Sun to 1 au conditions were different, a 4 August 1972 magnetic storm and magnetospheric dawn-to-dusk electric fields substantially larger than the Carrington event would have occurred. Under these special interplanetary conditions, a Miyake et al. (2012)-like extreme SEP event may have been formed. The long duration complex 1989 storm was probably greater than the Carrington storm in the sense that the total ring current particle energy was larger.</description>

      <title>The role of sputtered atom and ion energy distribution in films deposited by Physical Vapor Deposition: A molecular dynamics approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of copper film growth with a constant energy neutral beam, thermal evaporation, dc magnetron sputtering, high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiP-IMS), and bipolar HiPIMS, through molecular dynamics simulations. Experimentally determined energy distribution functions were utilized to model the deposition processes. Our results indicate significant differences in the film quality, growth rate, and substrate erosion between the various physical vapor deposition techniques. Bipolar HiPIMS shows the potential for improved film structure under certain conditions, albeit with increased substrate erosion. Bipolar +180 V HiPIMS with 10% Cu + ions exhibited the best film properties in terms of crystallinity and atomic stress among the PVD processes investigated.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal Hall effect in dense electron-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$, carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$, helium $\isotope[4]{He}$, or hydrogen $\isotope[1]{H}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by Leduc-Righi coefficient. The transition from degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Single-pulse Gy-scale irradiation of biological cells at average dose-rates above $10^{13}$ Gy/s from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental characterization of a laser-wakefield accelerator able to deliver, in a single pulse, doses in excess of 1 Gy on timescales of the order of tens of femtoseconds, reaching unprecedented average dose-rates above $10^{13}$ Gy/s. The irradiator is demonstrated to deliver doses tuneable up to 2.2 Gy in a cm$^2$ area and with a high degree of longitudinal and transverse uniformity in a single irradiation. In this regime, proof-of-principle irradiation of patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells and human skin fibroblast cells show indications of a differential cellular response, when compared to reference irradiations at conventional dose-rates. These include a statistically significant increase in relative biological effectiveness ($1.40\pm0.08$ at 50\% survival for both cell lines) and a significant reduction of the relative radioresistance of tumour cells. Data analysis provides preliminary indications that these effects might not be fully explained by induced oxygen depletion in the cells but may be instead linked to a higher complexity of the damages triggered by the ultra-high density of ionising tracks of femtosecond-scale radiation pulses. These results demonstrate an integrated platform for systematic radiobiological studies at unprecedented beam durations and dose-rates, a unique infrastructure for translational research in radiobiology at the femtosecond scale.</description>

Abstract: Kinetic scale dynamics in weakly-collisional space plasmas usually exhibits a self-similar statistics of magnetic field fluctuations which implies the existence of an invariant probability density function (master curve). We provide an analytical derivation of the master curve by assuming that perpendicular fluctuations can be modeled through a scale-dependent Langevin equation. In our model, magnetic field fluctuations are the stochastic variable and their scale-to-scale evolution is assumed to be a Langevin process. We propose a formal derivation of the master curve describing the statistics of the fluctuations at kinetic scales. Model predictions are tested on independent data samples of fast solar wind measured near the Sun by Parker Solar Probe and near the Earth by Cluster. The master curve is a generalization of the Kappa distribution with two parameters: one regulating the tails and the other one controlling the asymmetry. Model predictions match the spacecraft observations up to 5$\sigma$ and even beyond in the case of perpendicular magnetic field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Radiative hydrodynamic equations with nonequilibrium radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decoding the formation of hammerhead ion populations observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In situ observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have revealed new properties of the proton velocity distributions, including hammerhead features that suggest non-isotropic broadening of the beams. The present work proposes a very plausible explanation for the formation of these populations through the action of a proton firehose-like instability triggered by the proton beam. The quasi-linear (QL) theory proposed here shows that the resulting right-hand (RH) waves have two consequences on the protons: (i) reduce the relative drift between the beam and the core, but above all, (ii) induce a strong perpendicular temperature anisotropy, specific to the observed hammerhead ion strahl. Moreover, the long-run QL results suggest that these hammerhead distributions are rather transitory states, still subject to relaxation mechanisms, of which instabilities like the one discussed here are very likely involved.</description>

      <title>Embedding theory contributions to average atom models for warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling in the warm dense matter regime is a persistent challenge with the most detailed models such as quantum molecular dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo being immensely computationally expensive. Density functional theory (DFT)-based average atom models (AAM) offer significant speed-ups in calculation times while still retaining fair accuracy in evaluating equations of state, mean ionizations, and more. Despite their success, AAMs struggle to precisely account for electronic interactions -- in particular, they do not account for effects on the kinetic energy arising from overlaps in neighboring atom densities. We aim to enhance these models by including such interactions via the non-additive kinetic potential $v^{\rm nadd}$ as in DFT embedding theories. $v^{\rm nadd}$ can be computed using Thomas-Fermi, von Weizs\"acker, or more sophisticated kinetic energy functionals. The proposed model introduces $v^{\rm nadd}$ as a novel interaction term in existing ion-correlation models, which include interactions beyond the central atom. We have applied this model to hydrogen at 5 eV and densities ranging 0.008 to 0.8 g/cm$^3$, and investigated the effects of $v^{\rm nadd}$ on electron densities, Kohn-Sham energy level shifts, mean ionization, and total energies.</description>

      <title>EuroPED-NN: Uncertainty aware surrogate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work successfully generates an uncertainty-aware surrogate model of the EuroPED plasma pedestal model using the Bayesian neural network with noise contrastive prior (BNN-NCP) technique. This model is trained using data from the JET-ILW pedestal database and subsequent model evaluations, conforming to EuroPED-NN. The BNN-NCP technique has been proven to be a suitable method for generating uncertainty-aware surrogate models. It matches the output results of a regular neural network while providing confidence estimates for predictions as uncertainties. Additionally, it highlights out-of-distribution (OOD) regions using surrogate model uncertainties. This provides critical insights into model robustness and reliability. EuroPED-NN has been physically validated, first, analyzing electron density $n_e\!\left(\psi_{\text{pol}}=0.94\right)$ with respect to increasing plasma current, $I_p$, and second, validating the $\Delta-\beta_{p,ped}$ relation associated with the EuroPED model. This affirms the robustness of the underlying physics learned by the surrogate model. On top of that, the method was used to develop a EuroPED-like model fed with experimental data, i.e. an uncertainty aware experimental model, which is functional in JET database. Both models have been also tested in $\sim 50$ AUG shots.</description>

      <title>Electric field effects during disruptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tokamak disruptions are associated with breaking magnetic surfaces, which makes magnetic field lines chaotic in large regions of the plasma. The enforcement of quasi-neutrality in a region of chaotic field lines requires an electric potential that has both short and long correlation distances across the magnetic field lines. The short correlation distances produce a Bohm-like diffusion coefficient $\sim T_e/eB$ and the long correlation distances $a_T$ produce a large scale flow $\sim T_e/eB a_T$. This cross-field diffusion and flow are important for sweeping impurities into the core of a disrupting tokamak. The analysis separates of the electric field in a plasma into the sum of a divergence-free, $\vec{E}_B$, and a curl-free, $\vec{E}_q$, part, a Helmholtz decomposition. The divergence-free part of $\vec{E}$ determines the evolution of the magnetic field. The curl-free part enforces quasi-neutrality, $\vec{E}_q=-\vec{\nabla}\Phi_q$. Magnetic helicity evolution gives the required boundary condition for a unique Helmholtz decomposition and an unfortunate constraint on steady-state tokamak maintenance.</description>

      <title>Piecewise omnigenous stellarators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In omnigeneous magnetic fields, charged particles are perfectly confined in the absence of collisions and turbulence. For this reason, the magnetic configuration is optimized to be close to omnigenity in any candidate for a stellarator fusion reactor. However, approaching omnigenity imposes severe constraints on the spatial variation of the magnetic field. In particular, the topology of the contours of constant magnetic-field-strength on each magnetic surface must be such that there are no particles transitioning between different types of wells. This, in turn, usually leads to complicated plasma shapes and coils. This Letter presents a new family of optimized fields that display tokamak-like collisional energy transport while having transitioning particles. This result radically broadens the space of accessible reactor-relevant configurations.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>

Abstract: $\textit{AIMS.}$ To investigate processes associated with generation of type-III radiation.
  $\textit{METHODS.}$ Measure the amplitudes and phase velocities of Parker Solar Probe observed electric fields, magnetic fields, and plasma density fluctuations.
  $\textit{RESULTS.}$ (1) There are slow electrostatic waves near the Langmuir frequency and at as many as six harmonics, the number of which increases with the amplitude of the Langmuir wave. Their electrostatic nature is shown by measurement of the plasma density fluctuations. From these density fluctuations and the electric field magnitude, the k-value of the Langmuir wave is estimated to be 0.14 and $k \lambda_d$ = 0.4. Even with a large uncertainty in this quantity (more than a factor of two) the phase velocity of the Langmuir wave was &lt;10,000 km/sec. (2) There is an electromagnetic wave near the Langmuir frequency having a phase velocity &lt;50,000 km/sec. (3) Whether there are electromagnetic waves at the harmonics of the Langmuir frequency cannot be determined because, if they existed, their magnetic field components would be below the noise level of the measurement. (4) The rapid (less than one msec) amplitude variations typical of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics are artifacts resulting from addition of two waves, one of which has small frequency variations that arise from traveling through density irregularities. None of these results are expected in or consistent with the conventional model of the three-wave interaction of two counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the type-III wave. They are consistent with a new model in which electrostatic antenna waves are produced at the harmonics by radiation of the Langmuir wave, after which at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities such that its wave number decreased and it became the type-III radiation.</description>
