      <title>PSMC: Provable and Scalable Algorithms for Motif Conductance Based Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order graph clustering aims to partition the graph using frequently occurring subgraphs. Motif conductance is one of the most promising higher-order graph clustering models due to its strong interpretability. However, existing motif conductance based graph clustering algorithms are mainly limited by a seminal two-stage reweighting computing framework, needing to enumerate all motif instances to obtain an edge-weighted graph for partitioning. However, such a framework has two-fold vital defects: (1) It can only provide a quadratic bound for the motif with three vertices, and whether there is provable clustering quality for other motifs is still an open question. (2) The enumeration procedure of motif instances incurs prohibitively high costs against large motifs or large dense graphs due to combinatorial explosions. Besides, expensive spectral clustering or local graph diffusion on the edge-weighted graph also makes existing methods unable to handle massive graphs with millions of nodes. To overcome these dilemmas, we propose a Provable and Scalable Motif Conductance algorithm PSMC, which has a fixed and motif-independent approximation ratio for any motif. Specifically, PSMC first defines a new vertex metric Motif Resident based on the given motif, which can be computed locally. Then, it iteratively deletes the vertex with the smallest motif resident value very efficiently using novel dynamic update technologies. Finally, it outputs the locally optimal result during the above iterative process. To further boost efficiency, we propose several effective bounds to estimate the motif resident value of each vertex, which can greatly reduce computational costs. Empirical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve 3.2-32 times speedup and improve the quality by at least 12 times than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Data Complexity in Expressive Description Logics With Path Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the data complexity of the satisfiability problem for the very expressive description logic ZOIQ (a.k.a. ALCHb Self reg OIQ) over quasi-forests and establish its NP-completeness. This completes the data complexity landscape for decidable fragments of ZOIQ, and reproves known results on decidable fragments of OWL2 (SR family). Using the same technique, we establish coNEXPTIME-completeness (w.r.t. the combined complexity) of the entailment problem of rooted queries in ZIQ.</description>

      <title>On the power of adaption and randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present bounds between different widths of convex subsets of Banach spaces, including Gelfand and Bernstein widths. Using this, and some relations between widths and minimal errors, we obtain bounds on the maximal gain of adaptive and randomized algorithms over non-adaptive, deterministic ones for approximating linear operators on convex sets. Our results also apply to the approximation of embeddings into the space of bounded functions based on function evaluations, i.e., to sampling recovery in the uniform norm. We conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Disrupting Bipartite Trading Networks: Matching for Revenue Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the role of an online platform disrupting a market with unit-demand buyers and unit-supply sellers. Each seller can transact with a subset of the buyers whom she already knows, as well as with any additional buyers to whom she is introduced by the platform. Given these constraints on trade, prices and transactions are induced by a competitive equilibrium. The platform's revenue is proportional to the total price of all trades between platform-introduced buyers and sellers.
  In general, we show that the platform's revenue-maximization problem is computationally intractable. We provide structural results for revenue-optimal matchings and isolate special cases in which the platform can efficiently compute them. Furthermore, in a market where the maximum increase in social welfare that the platform can create is $\Delta W$, we prove that the platform can attain revenue $\Omega(\Delta W/\log(\min\{n,m\}))$, where $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of buyers and sellers, respectively. When $\Delta W$ is large compared to welfare without the platform, this gives a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a logarithmic approximation of the optimal welfare as revenue. We also show that even when the platform optimizes for revenue, the social welfare is at least an $O(\log(\min\{n,m\}))$-approximation to the optimal welfare. Finally, we prove significantly stronger bounds for revenue and social welfare in homogeneous-goods markets.</description>

      <title>Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{\Theta(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.
  2) Random quantum circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error unitary $t$-designs for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$; for $t\leq \Theta(2^{2n/5})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2t)$ gates suffice.
  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits. In our reduction, we approximate the structured walk with local random circuits without losing the gap, which uses tools from the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Recognition of Seifert fibered spaces with boundary is in NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the decision problem of recognising whether a triangulated 3-manifold admits a Seifert fibered structure with non-empty boundary is in NP. We also show that the problem of producing Seifert data for a triangulation of such a manifold is in the complexity class FNP. We do this by proving that in any triangulation of a Seifert fibered space with boundary there is both a fundamental horizontal surface of small degree and a complete collection of normal vertical annuli whose total weight is bounded by an exponential in the square of the triangulation size.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require $\Omega(n)$ T gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent resolution of the NLTS Conjecture [ABN22] establishes a prerequisite to the Quantum PCP (QPCP) Conjecture through a novel use of newly-constructed QLDPC codes [LZ22]. Even with NLTS now solved, there remain many independent and unresolved prerequisites to the QPCP Conjecture, such as the NLSS Conjecture of [GL22]. In this work we focus on a specific and natural prerequisite to both NLSS and the QPCP Conjecture, namely, the existence of local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states all require $\omega(\log n)$ T gates to prepare. In fact, we prove a stronger result which is not necessarily implied by either conjecture: we construct local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require $\Omega(n)$ T gates. We further show that our procedure can be applied to the NLTS Hamiltonians of [ABN22] to yield local Hamiltonians whose low-energy states require both $\Omega(\log n)$-depth and $\Omega(n)$ T gates to prepare. In order to accomplish this we define a "pseudo-stabilizer" property of a state with respect to each local Hamiltonian term, and prove an additive local energy lower bound for each term at which the state is pseudo-stabilizer. By proving a relationship between the number of T gates preparing a state and the number of terms at which the state is pseudo-stabilizer, we are able to give a constant energy lower bound which applies to any state with T-count less than $c \cdot n$ for some fixed positive constant $c$. This result represents a significant improvement over [CCNN23] where we used a different technique to give an energy bound which only distinguishes between stabilizer states and states which require a non-zero number of T gates.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Strings and Longest Common Subsequences in a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study for the first time the Diverse Longest Common Subsequences (LCSs) problem under Hamming distance. Given a set of a constant number of input strings, the problem asks to decide if there exists some subset $\mathcal X$ of $K$ longest common subsequences whose diversity is no less than a specified threshold $\Delta$, where we consider two types of diversities of a set $\mathcal X$ of strings of equal length: the Sum diversity and the Min diversity defined as the sum and the minimum of the pairwise Hamming distance between any two strings in $\mathcal X$, respectively. We analyze the computational complexity of the respective problems with Sum- and Min-diversity measures, called the Max-Sum and Max-Min Diverse LCSs, respectively, considering both approximation algorithms and parameterized complexity. Our results are summarized as follows. When $K$ is bounded, both problems are polynomial time solvable. In contrast, when $K$ is unbounded, both problems become NP-hard, while Max-Sum Diverse LCSs problem admits a PTAS. Furthermore, we analyze the parameterized complexity of both problems with combinations of parameters $K$ and $r$, where $r$ is the length of the candidate strings to be selected. Importantly, all positive results above are proven in a more general setting, where an input is an edge-labeled directed acyclic graph (DAG) that succinctly represents a set of strings of the same length. Negative results are proven in the setting where an input is explicitly given as a set of strings. The latter results are equipped with an encoding such a set as the longest common subsequences of a specific input string set.</description>
