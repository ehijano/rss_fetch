      <title>Unique continuation for area minimizing currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to prove an instance of the unique continuation principle for area minimizing integral currents. More precisely, consider an $m$-dimensional area minimizing integral current and an $m$-dimensional minimal surface, both contained in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ with $n\geq 1$. We show that if, in an integral sense, the current has infinite order of contact with the minimal surface at a point, then the current and the minimal surface coincide in a neighborhood of that point.</description>

      <title>Finite Energy Geodesic Rays in Big Cohomology Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a big class represented by $\theta$, we show that the metric space $(\mathcal{E}^{p}(X,\theta),d_{p})$ for $p \geq 1$ is Buseman convex. This allows us to construct a chordal metric $d_{p}^{c}$ on the space of geodesic rays in $\mathcal{E}^{p}(X,\theta)$. We also prove that the space of finite $p$-energy geodesic rays with the chordal metric $d_{p}^{c}$ is a complete geodesic metric space.
  With the help of the metric $d_{p}$, we find a characterization of geodesic rays lying in $\mathcal{E}^{p}(X,\theta)$ in terms of the corresponding test curves via the Ross-Witt Nystr\"om correspondence. This result is new even in the K\"ahler setting.</description>

      <title>A geometric application of Lagrange multipliers: extremal compatible linear connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The L\'evi-Civita connection of a Riemannian manifold is a metric (compatible) linear connection, uniquely determined by its vanishing torsion. It is extremal in the sense that it has minimal torsion at each point. We can extend this idea to more general spaces with more general (not necessarily quadratic) indicatrix hypersurfaces in the tangent spaces. Here, the existence of compatible linear connections on the base manifold is not guaranteed anymore, which needs to be addressed along with the intrinsic characterization of the extremal one. The first step is to provide the Riemann metrizability of the compatible linear connections. This Riemannian environment establishes a one-to-one correspondence between linear connections and their torsion tensors, also giving a way of measuring the length of the latter. The second step is to solve a hybrid conditional extremum problem at each point of the base manifold, all of whose constraint equations (compatibility equations) involve functions defined on the indicatrix hypersurface. The objective function to be minimized is a quadratic squared norm function defined on the finite dimensional fiber (vector space) of the torsion tensor bundle. We express the solution by using the method of Lagrange multipliers on function spaces point by point, we present a necessary and sufficient condition of the solvability and the solution is also given in terms of intrinsic quantities affecting the uniform size of the linear isometry groups of the indicatrices. This completes the description of differential geometric spaces admitting compatible linear connections on the base manifold, called generalized Berwald spaces, in Finsler geometry.</description>

      <title>Constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics and semistable vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the projectivisation of a slope semistable vector bundle to admit constant scalar curvature K\"ahler (cscK) metrics in adiabatic classes, when the base admits a constant scalar curvature metric. More precisely, we introduce a stability condition on vector bundles, which we call adiabatic slope stability, which is a weaker version of K-stability and involves only test configurations arising from subsheaves of the bundle. We prove that, for a simple vector bundle with locally free graded object, adiabatic slope stability is equivalent to the existence of cscK metrics on the projectivisation, which solves a problem that has been open since work of Ross--Thomas. In particular, this shows that the existence of cscK metrics is equivalent to K-stability in this setting. We provide a numerical criterion for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant associated to said test configurations in terms of Chern classes of the vector bundle. This criterion is computable in practice and we present an explicit example satisfying our assumptions which is coming from a vector bundle that does not admit a Hermite-Einstein metric.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we will show that if a measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit space of a sequence of Riemannian manifolds with lower Ricci curvature bound has dense 2-regular set, then it is homeomorphic to a 2-dimensional manifold in an open full measure set. This result gives a positive answer to an open problem in [Naber, Open problem 3.4] in dimension 2 and for dimension larger than 2 there are counterexamples by [HNW, Zhou].</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of Fractal Spaces Using Replacement and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial Loewner property was introduced by Bourdon and Kleiner as a quasismmetrically invariant substitute for the Loewner property for general fractals and boundaries of hyperbolic groups. While the Loewner property is somewhat restrictive, the combinatorial Loewner property is very generic -- Bourdon and Kleiner showed that many familiar fractals and group boundaries satisfy it. If $X$ is quasisymmetric to a Loewner space, it has the combinatorial Loewner property. Kleiner conjectured in 2006 that the converse to this holds for self-similar fractals -- the hope being that this would lead to the existence of many exotic Loewner spaces. We disprove this conjecture and give the first examples of spaces which are self-similar and combinatorially Loewner and which are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.
  In the process we introduce a self-similar replacement rule, called a linear replacement rule, which is inspired by the work of Laakso. This produces a new rich class of fractal spaces, where closed form computations of potentials and their conformal dimensions are possible. These spaces exhibit a rich class of behaviors from analysis on fractals in regards to diffusions, Sobolev spaces, energy measures and conformal dimensions. These behaviors expand on the known examples of Cantor sets, gaskets, Vicsek sets, and the often too difficult carpet-like spaces. Especially the counter examples to Kleiner's conjecture that arise from this construction are interesting, since they open up the possibility to study the new realm of combinatorially Loewner spaces that are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.</description>

Abstract: We use global bifurcation techniques to establish the existence of arbitrarily many geometrically distinct nonplanar embedded smooth minimal 2-spheres in sufficiently elongated 3-dimensional ellipsoids of revolution. More precisely, we quantify the growth rate of the number of such minimal spheres, and describe their asymptotic behavior as the ellipsoids converge to a cylinder.</description>

Abstract: We construct complete Calabi-Yau metrics on non-compact manifolds that are smoothings of an initial complete intersection $V_0$ that is a Calabi-Yau cone, extending the work of Sz\'ekelyhidi (2019). The constructed Calabi-Yau manifold has tangent cone at infinity given by $\mathbb{C} \times V_0$. This construction produces Calabi-Yau metrics with fibers having varying complex structures and possibly isolated singularities.</description>

Abstract: We examine the heap of linear connections on anchored vector bundles and Lie algebroids. Naturally, this covers the example of affine connections on a manifold. We present some new interpretations of classical results via this ternary structure of connections. Endomorphisms of linear connections are studied, and their ternary structure, in particular the endomorphism truss, is explicitly presented. We remark that the use of ternary structures in differential geometry is novel and that the endomorphism truss of linear connections provides a concrete geometric example of a truss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By making use of Halperin's local systems over simplicial sets and the model structure of the category of diffeological spaces due to Kihara, we introduce a framework of rational homotopy theory for such smooth spaces with arbitrary fundamental groups. As a consequence, we have an equivalence between the homotopy categories of fibrewise rational diffeological spaces and an algebraic category of minimal local systems elaborated by G\'omez-Tato, Halperin and Tanr\'e. In the latter half of this article, a spectral sequence converging to the singular de Rham cohomology of a diffeological adjunction space is constructed with the pullback of relevant local systems. In case of a stratifold obtained by attaching manifolds, the spectral sequence converges to the Souriau--de Rham cohomology algebra of the diffeological space. By using the pullback construction, we also discuss a local system model for a topological homotopy pushout.</description>

      <title>A general nonlinear characterization of stochastic incompleteness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic incompleteness of a Riemannian manifold $M$ amounts to the nonconservation of probability for the heat semigroup on $M$. We show that this property is equivalent to the existence of nonnegative, nontrivial, bounded (sub)solutions to $\Delta W=\psi(W)$ for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\psi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing, with $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi&gt;0$ in $(0,+\infty)$. Similar statements hold for unsigned (sub)solutions. We also prove that stochastic incompleteness is equivalent to the nonuniqueness of bounded solutions to the nonlinear parabolic equation $\partial_t u =\Delta\phi(u)$ with bounded initial data for one, hence all, general nonlinearity $\phi$ which is only required to be continuous, nondecreasing and nonconstant. Such a generality allows us to deal with equations of both fast-diffusion and porous-medium type, as well as with the one-phase and two-phase classical Stefan problems, which seem to have never been investigated in the manifold setting.</description>

      <title>Sharp systolic inequalities for invariant tight contact forms on principal S1-bundles over S2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systole of a contact form $\alpha$ is defined as the shortest period of closed Reeb orbits of $\alpha$. Given a non-trivial $\mathbb S^1$-principal bundle over $\mathbb S^2$ with total space $M$, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for the class of tight contact form on $M$ invariant under the $\mathbb S^1$-action. This inequality exhibits a behavior which depends on the Euler class of the bundle in a subtle way. As applications, we prove a sharp systolic inequality for rotationally symmetric Finsler metrics on $\mathbb S^2$, a systolic inequality for the shortest contractible closed Reeb orbit, and a particular case of a conjecture by Viterbo.</description>

      <title>Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for log terminal K\"ahler threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we are concerned with two main themes revolving around compact K\"ahler spaces with log terminal singularities. The first one is the orbifold version of the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for stable $\mathbb Q$-sheaves on threefolds while the second one has to do with the construction of canonical metrics on such spaces and their properties.</description>
