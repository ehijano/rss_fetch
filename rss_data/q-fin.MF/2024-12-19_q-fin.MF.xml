      <title>On stochastic control problems with higher-order moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a class of time-inconsistent stochastic control problems, where the objective function includes the mean and several higher-order central moments of the terminal value of state. To tackle the time-inconsistency, we seek both the closed-loop and the open-loop Nash equilibrium controls as time-consistent solutions. We establish a partial differential equation (PDE) system for deriving a closed-loop Nash equilibrium control, which does not include the equilibrium value function and is different from the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations as in Bj\"ork et al. (Finance Stoch. 21: 331-360, 2017). We show that our PDE system is equivalent to the extended HJB equations that seems difficult to be solved for our higher-order moment problems. In deriving an open-loop Nash equilibrium control, due to the non-separable higher-order moments in the objective function, we make some moment estimates in addition to the standard perturbation argument for developing a maximum principle. Then, the problem is reduced to solving a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. In particular, we investigate linear controlled dynamics and some objective functions affine in the mean. The closed-loop and the open-loop Nash equilibrium controls are identical, which are independent of the state value, random path and the preference on the odd-order central moments. By sending the highest order of central moments to infinity, we obtain the time-consistent solutions to some control problems whose objective functions include some penalty functions for deviation.</description>

      <title>Strictly monotone mean-variance preferences with dynamic portfolio management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to extending the monotone mean-variance (MMV) preference to a large class of strictly monotone mean-variance (SMMV) preferences, and illustrating its application to single-period/continuous-time portfolio selection problems. The properties and equivalent representations of the SMMV preference are also studied. To illustrate applications, we provide the gradient condition for the single-period portfolio problem with SMMV preferences, and investigate its association with the optimal mean-variance static strategy. For the continuous-time portfolio problem with SMMV preferences and continuous price processes, we show the condition that the solution is the same as the corresponding optimal mean-variance strategy. When this consistency condition is not satisfied, the primal problems are unbounded, and we turn to study a sequence of approximate linear-quadratic problems generated by penalty function method. The solution can be characterized by stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs equation, but it is still difficult to derive a closed-form expression. We take a joint adoption of embedding method and convex duality method to derive an analytical solution. In particular, if the parameter that characterizes the strict monotonicity of SMMV preference is a constant, the solution can be given by two equations in the form of Black-Scholes formula.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statics of Trading Boundary in Finite Horizon Portfolio Selection with Proportional Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Merton's problem with proportional transaction costs. It is well-known that the optimal investment strategy is characterized by two trading boundaries, i.e., the buy boundary and the sell boundary, between which is the no-trading region. We study how the two trading boundaries vary with transaction costs. We reveal that the cost-adjusted trading boundaries are monotone in transaction costs. Our result indicates that (i) the Merton line must lie between two cost-adjusted trading boundaries; (ii) when the Merton line is positive, the buy boundary and the sell boundary are monotone in transaction costs and the Merton line lies in the no-trading region as a result.</description>
