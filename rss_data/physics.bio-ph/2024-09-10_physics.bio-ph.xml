      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and primary headaches, and has recently gathered attention due to its preventive effect on viral attacks. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade already in the late 1940s, the underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. The therapeutic effect is achieved through long-term exposure to lower doses, where it, opposite to acute doses, alleviates excessive cellular activity, and induces a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression.
  This review investigates how lithium ions affect membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability, and ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>

      <title>Modelling how lamellipodia-driven cells maintain persistent migration and interact with external barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell motility is fundamental to many biological processes, and cells exhibit a variety of migration patterns. Many motile cell types follow a universal law that connects their speed and persistency, a property that can originate from the intracellular transport of polarity cues due to the global actin retrograde flow. This mechanism was termed the ``Universal Coupling between cell Speed and Persistency"(UCSP). Here we implemented a simplified version of the UCSP mechanism in a coarse-grained ``minimal-cell" model, which is composed of a three-dimensional vesicle that contains curved active proteins. This model spontaneously forms a lamellipodia-like motile cell shape, which is however sensitive and can depolarize into a non-motile form due to random fluctuations or when interacting with external obstacles. The UCSP implementation introduces long-range inhibition, which stabilizes the motile phenotype. This allows our model to describe the robust polarity observed in cells and explain a large variety of cellular dynamics, such as the relation between cell speed and aspect ratio, cell-barrier scattering, and cellular oscillations in different types of geometric confinements.</description>

      <title>Settling aerodynamics is a driver of symmetry in deciduous tree leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leaves shed by deciduous trees contain 40\% of the annually sequestered carbon, and include nutrients vital to the expansion and health of forest ecosystems. To achieve this, leaves must fall quickly to land near the parent tree -- otherwise, they are lost to the wind, like pollen or gliding seeds. However, the link between leaf shape and sedimentation speed remains unclear. To gauge the relative performance of extant leaves, we developed an automated sedimentation apparatus (ASAP) capable of performing $\sim100$ free fall experiments per day on biomimetic paper leaves. The majority of 25 representative leaves settle at rates similar to our control (a circular disc). Strikingly, the Arabidopsid mutant asymmetric leaves1 (as1) fell 15\% slower than the wild type. Applying the as1-digital mutation to deciduous tree leaves revealed a similar speed reduction. Data correlating shape and settling across a broad range of natural, mutated, and artificial leaves support thefast-leaf-hypothesis: Deciduous leaves are symmetric and relatively unlobed in part because this maximizes their settling speed and concomitant nutrient retention.</description>

      <title>Ordering, spontaneous flows and aging in active fluids depositing tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence shows that cell monolayers can induce long-lived perturbations to their environment, akin to footprints, which in turn influence the global dynamics of the system. Inspired by these observations, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe systems where an active field dynamically interacts with a non-advected footprint field, deposited by the active field. We derive the corresponding general hydrodynamics for both polar and nematic fields. Our findings reveal that the dynamic coupling to a footprint field induces remarkable effects absent in classical active hydrodynamics, such as symmetry-dependent modifications to the isotropic-ordered transition, which may manifest as either second-order or first-order, alterations in spontaneous flow transitions, potentially resulting in oscillating flows and rotating fields, and initial condition-dependent aging dynamics characterized by long-lived transient states. Our results suggest that footprint deposition could be a key mechanism determining the dynamical phases of cellular systems, or more generally active systems inducing long-lived perturbations to their environment.</description>

      <title>Magnetization transfer explains most of the $T_1$ variability in the MRI literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To identify the predominant source of the $T_1$ variability described in the literature, which ranges from 0.6 - 1.1 s for brain white matter at 3 T.
  Methods: 25 $T_1$-mapping methods from the literature were simulated with a mono-exponential and magnetization-transfer (MT) models, each followed by mono-exponential fitting. A single set of model parameters was assumed for the simulation of all methods, and these parameters were estimated by fitting the simulation-based to the corresponding literature $T_1$ values of white matter at 3 T.
  Results: Mono-exponential simulations suggest good inter-method reproducibility and fail to explain the highly variable $T_1$ estimates in the literature. In contrast, MT simulations suggest that a mono-exponential fit results in a variable $T_1$ and explain up to 62% of the literature's variability.
  Conclusion: The results suggest that a mono-exponential model does not adequately describe longitudinal relaxation in biological tissue. Therefore, $T_1$ in biological tissue should be considered only a semi-quantitative metric that is inherently contingent upon the imaging methodology; and comparisons between different $T_1$-mapping methods and the use of simplistic spin systems - such as doped-water phantoms - for validation should be viewed with caution.</description>

      <title>When lowering temperature, the in vivo circadian clock in cyanobacteria follows and surpasses the in vitro protein clock trough the Hopf bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in vivo circadian clock in single cyanobacteria is studied here by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy when the temperature is lowered below 25{\deg}C . We first disentangle the circadian clock behavior from the bacterial cold shock response by identifying a sequence of "death steps" based on cellular indicators. By analyzing only "alive" tracks, we show that the dynamic response of individual oscillatory tracks to a step-down temperature signal is described by a simple Stuart-Landau oscillator model. The same dynamical analysis applied to in vitro data (KaiC phosphorylation level following a temperature step-down) allows for extracting and comparing both clock's responses to a temperature step down. It appears, therefore, that both oscillators go through a similar supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Finally, to quantitatively describe the temperature dependence of the resulting in vivo and in vitro Stuart-Landau parameters $\mu(T)$ and $\omega_c(T)$, we propose two simplified analytical models: temperature-dependent positive feedback or time-delayed negative feedback that is temperature compensated. Our results provide strong constraints for future models and emphasize the importance of studying transitory regimes along temperature effects in circadian systems.</description>

      <title>Phenotype selection due to mutational robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mutation-selection mechanism of Darwinian evolution gives rise not only to adaptation to environmental conditions but also to the enhancement of robustness against mutations. When two or more phenotypes have the same fitness value, the robustness distribution for different phenotypes can vary. Thus, we expect that some phenotypes are favored in evolution and that some are hardly selected because of a selection bias for mutational robustness. In this study, we investigated this selection bias for phenotypes in a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using numerical simulations. The model had one input gene accepting a signal from the outside and one output gene producing a target protein, and the fitness was high if the output for the full signal was much higher than that for no signal. The model exhibited three types of responses to changes in the input signal: monostable, toggle switch, and one-way switch. We regarded these three response types as three distinguishable phenotypes. We constructed a randomly generated set of GRNs using the multicanonical Monte Carlo method originally developed in statistical physics and compared it to the outcomes of evolutionary simulations. One-way switches were strongly suppressed during evolution because of their lack of mutational robustness. By examining one-way switch GRNs in detail, we found that mutationally robust GRNs obtained by evolutionary simulations and non-robust GRNs obtained by McMC have different network structures. While robust GRNs have a common core motif, non-robust GRNs lack this motif. The bistability of non-robust GRNs is considered to be realized cooperatively by many genes, and these cooperative genotypes have been suppressed by evolution.</description>

      <title>The random walk of intermittently self-propelled particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by various recent experimental findings, we propose a dynamical model of intermittently self-propelled particles: active particles that recurrently switch between two modes of motion, namely an active run-state and a turn state, in which self-propulsion is absent. The durations of these motility modes are derived from arbitrary waiting-time distributions. We derive the expressions for exact forms of transport characteristics like mean-square displacements and diffusion coefficients to describe such processes. Furthermore, the conditions for the emergence of sub- and superdiffusion in the long-time limit are presented. We give examples of some important processes that occur as limiting cases of our system, including run-and-tumble motion of bacteria, L\'evy walks, hop-and-trap dynamics, intermittent diffusion and continuous time random walks.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bacterial rheotaxis in non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria often exhibit upstream swimming, which can cause the contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs including the urethra or lungs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.</description>

      <title>Transient contacts between filaments impart its elasticity to branched actin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Branched actin networks exert pushing forces in eukaryotic cells, and adapt their stiffness to their environment. The physical basis for their mechanics and adaptability is however not understood. Indeed, here we show that their high density and low connectivity place them outside the scope of standard elastic network models for actin. We combine high-precision mechanical experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and a mean-field elastic theory to show that they are instead dominated by the proliferation of interfilament contacts under compression. This places branched actin in the same category as undercoordinated, fibrous materials such as sheep's wool. When the network is grown under force, filaments entangle as if knitted together and trap contacts in their structure. Trapped contacts play a similar role as crosslinkers in rigidifying the network, and are thus key to its active adaptive mechanics.</description>
