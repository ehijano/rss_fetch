      <title>Quantifying Local Strain Field and Deformation in Active Contraction of Bladder Using a Pretrained Transformer Model: A Speckle-Free Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local strain fields during bladder contraction is essential for understanding the biomechanics of bladder micturition, in both health and disease. Conventional digital image correlation (DIC) methods have been successfully applied to various biological tissues; however, this approach requires artificial speckling, which can alter both passive and active properties of the tissue. In this study, we introduce a speckle-free framework for quantifying local strain fields using a state-of-the-art, zero-shot transformer model, CoTracker3. We utilized a custom-designed, portable isotonic biaxial apparatus compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to demonstrate this approach, successfully tracking natural bladder lumen textures without artificial markers. Benchmark tests validated the method's high pixel accuracy and low strain errors. Our framework effectively captured heterogeneous deformation patterns, despite complex folding and buckling, which conventional DIC often fails to track. Application to in vitro active bladder contractions in four rat specimens (n=4) revealed statistically significant anisotropy (p&lt;0.01), with higher contraction longitudinally compared to circumferentially. Multiphoton microscopy further illustrated and confirmed heterogeneous morphological changes, such as large fold formation during active contraction. This non-invasive approach eliminates speckle-induced artifacts, enabling more physiologically relevant measurements, and has broad applicability for material testing of other biological and engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Model-Assisted Causal Inference for the Treatment Effect on Recurrent Events in the Presence of Terminal Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by evaluating the benefits of patients receiving mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices in end-stage heart failure management inference, in which hypothesis testing for a treatment effect on the risk of recurrent events is challenged in the presence of terminal events. Existing methods based on cumulative frequency unreasonably disadvantage longer survivors as they tend to experience more recurrent events. The While-Alive-based (WA) test has provided a solution to address this survival-length-bias problem, and it performs well when the recurrent event rate holds constant over time. However, if such a constant-rate assumption is violated, the WA test can exhibit an inflated type I error and inaccurate estimation of treatment effects. To fill this methodological gap, we propose a Proportional Rate Marginal Structural Model-assisted Test (PR-MSMaT) in the causal inference framework of separable treatment effects for recurrent and terminal events. Using the simulation study, we demonstrate that our PR-MSMaT can properly control type I error while gaining power comparable to the WA test under time-varying recurrent event rates. We employ PR-MSMaT to compare different MCS devices with the postoperative risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among patients enrolled in the Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support program.</description>
