      <title>Tomographic diffractometry of laser-induced plasma formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sensitive optical diffractometry method is developed and utilized for advanced tomography of laser-induced air plasma formations. Using transverse diffractometry and Supergaussian plasma distribution modelling we extract the main parameters of the plasma being the plasma density, width and shape with 20 micrometer spatial resolution throughout the plasma formation. The experimentally recorded diffraction patterns fitted by the Supergaussian plasma model are found to capture unprecedentedly delicate traits in the evolution of the plasma from its effective birth and on. Key features in the spatial evolution of the plasma such as the 'escape position', the 'turning point' and the refocusing dynamics of the beam are identified and explored in details. Our work provides experimental and theoretical access into the highly nonlinear dynamics of laser-induced air plasma.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Edge Localized Modes in ITER Baseline Scenario in EAST using Edge Localized Magnetic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the suppression of Type-I Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) in the EAST tokamak under ITER baseline conditions using $n = 4$ Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs), while maintaining energy confinement. Achieving RMP-ELM suppression requires a normalized plasma beta ($\beta_N$) exceeding 1.8 in a target plasma with $q_{95}\approx 3.1$ and tungsten divertors. Quasi-linear modeling shows high plasma beta enhances RMP-driven neoclassical toroidal viscosity torque, reducing field penetration thresholds. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of high $n$ RMPs for ELM suppression in ITER.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic-preserving semi-Lagrangian algorithm for the anisotropic heat transport equation with arbitrary magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently proposed semi-Lagrangian algorithm for the extremely anisotropic heat transport equation [Chac\'on et al., J. Comput. Phys., 272 (2014)] to deal with arbitrary magnetic field topologies. The original scheme (which showed remarkable numerical properties) was valid for the so-called tokamak-ordering regime, in which the magnetic field magnitude was not allowed to vary much along field lines. The proposed extension maintains the attractive features of the original scheme (including the analytical Green's function, which is critical for tractability) with minor modifications, while allowing for completely general magnetic fields. The accuracy and generality of the approach are demonstrated by numerical experiment with an analytical manufactured solution.</description>

      <title>Enabling High-Throughput Parallel I/O in Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Simulations with openPMD and Darshan I/O Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale HPC simulations of plasma dynamics in fusion devices require efficient parallel I/O to avoid slowing down the simulation and to enable the post-processing of critical information. Such complex simulations lacking parallel I/O capabilities may encounter performance bottlenecks, hindering their effectiveness in data-intensive computing tasks. In this work, we focus on introducing and enhancing the efficiency of parallel I/O operations in Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations. We first evaluate the scalability of BIT1, a massively-parallel electrostatic PIC MC code, determining its initial write throughput capabilities and performance bottlenecks using an HPC I/O performance monitoring tool, Darshan. We design and develop an adaptor to the openPMD I/O interface that allows us to stream PIC particle and field information to I/O using the BP4 backend, aggressively optimized for I/O efficiency, including the highly efficient ADIOS2 interface. Next, we explore advanced optimization techniques such as data compression, aggregation, and Lustre file striping, achieving write throughput improvements while enhancing data storage efficiency. Finally, we analyze the enhanced high-throughput parallel I/O and storage capabilities achieved through the integration of openPMD with rapid metadata extraction in BP4 format. Our study demonstrates that the integration of openPMD and advanced I/O optimizations significantly enhances BIT1's I/O performance and storage capabilities, successfully introducing high throughput parallel I/O and surpassing the capabilities of traditional file I/O.</description>

      <title>Kinetic scales dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown, using results of fully kinetic 3D numerical simulations and observations in solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere that the transition from deterministic chaos to turbulence at kinetic (sub-ion) scales in space plasmas is generally dominated by magnetic helicity (an adiabatic invariant in a weakly dissipative plasma) directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology (the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence). Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the space observations in the frames of this approach.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional plasmoid-mediated reconnection and turbulence in Hall magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmoid instability accelerates reconnection in collisional plasmas by transforming a laminar reconnection layer into numerous plasmoids connected by secondary current sheets in two dimensions (2D) and by fostering self-generated turbulent reconnection in three dimensions (3D). In large-scale astrophysical and space systems, plasmoid instability likely initiates in the collisional regime but may transition into the collisionless regime as the fragmentation of the current sheet progresses toward kinetic scales. Hall MHD models are widely regarded as a simplified yet effective representation of the transition from collisional to collisionless reconnection. However, plasmoid instability in 2D Hall MHD simulations often leads to a single-X-line reconnection configuration, which significantly differs from fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. This study shows that single-X-line reconnection is less likely to occur in 3D compared to 2D. Moreover, depending on the Lundquist number and the ratio between the system size and the kinetic scale, Hall MHD can also realize 3D self-generated turbulent reconnection. We analyze the features of the self-generated turbulent state, including the energy power spectra and the scale dependence of turbulent eddy anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic flux-driven simulations in mixed TEM/ITG regime using a delta-f PIC scheme with evolving background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of global gyrokinetic simulations of turbulence using a Particle-In-Cell framework, verifying the delta-f assumption with a fixed background distribution becomes challenging when determining quasi-steady state profiles corresponding to given sources over long time scales, where plasma profiles can evolve significantly. The advantage of low relative sampling noise afforded by the delta-f scheme is shown to be retained by considering the background as a time-evolving Maxwellian with time-dependent density and temperature profiles. Implementation of this adaptive scheme to simulate electrostatic collisionless flux-driven turbulence in tokamak plasmas show small and non-increasing sampling noise levels, which would otherwise increase indefinitely with a stationary background scheme. The adaptive scheme furthermore allows one to reach numerically converged results of quasi-steady state with much lower marker numbers.</description>

      <title>Kinetic development of low-temperature propane oxidation in a repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetics of plasma assisted low temperature oxidation of C3H8O2Ar mixtures have been studied in a wide specific deposition energy with the help of nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharge. Two types of nanosecond pulsed plasma sources, the nanosecond capillary discharge (nCD) and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) combined with the synchrotron photoionization mass spectrometry are investigated. The electron impact reaction rate of propane dissociation and some combustion chemical reactions rate constants are updated according to the nCD and DBD experiment results,and uncertainty of the reactions are analyzed in detail. Compared to the existing model, the updated model's prediction accuracy has great improvement in species H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, CH2O, CH3OH, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C2H5OH, C2H5OOH, C3H4-A, C3H4-P, C2H5CHO, i-C3H7OH and C3H7OOH. The propane oxidation processes assisted by DBD and nCD were compared under different single pulse deposition energy (SPDE) conditions while maintaining the same total deposition energy. The reduced electric field in nCD is concentrated at 150-200 Td and 450-500 Td, whereas in DBD it ranges from 0-25 Td and 50-250 Td. Notably, SPDE shows minimal influence on the propane oxidation process, which is primarily controlled by total deposition energy and demonstrates little dependence on the discharge type (DBD or nCD).</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Driving Turbulent-like Fluctuations on a Harris-Current Sheet Configuration and the Formation of Plasmoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless plasmas is one of the most outstanding open questions in plasma physics. Magnetic reconnection and turbulence are two phenomena that can produce the conditions for energy dissipation. These two phenomena are closely related to each other in a wide range of plasmas. Turbulent fluctuations can emerge in critical regions of reconnection events, and magnetic reconnection can occur as a product of the turbulent cascade. In this study, we perform 2D particle-in-cell simulations of a reconnecting Harris current sheet in the presence of turbulent fluctuations to explore the effect of turbulence on the reconnection process in collisionless non-relativistic pair-plasmas. We find that the presence of a turbulent field can affect the onset and evolution of magnetic reconnection. Moreover, we observe the existence of a scale dependent amplitude of magnetic field fluctuations above which these fluctuations are able to disrupt the growing of magnetic islands. These fluctuations provide thermal energy to the particles within the current sheet and preferential perpendicular thermal energy to the background population.</description>
