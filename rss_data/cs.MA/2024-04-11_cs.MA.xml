      <title>The Role of Confidence for Trust-based Resilient Consensus (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-agent system where agents aim to achieve a consensus despite interactions with malicious agents that communicate misleading information. Physical channels supporting communication in cyberphysical systems offer attractive opportunities to detect malicious agents, nevertheless, trustworthiness indications coming from the channel are subject to uncertainty and need to be treated with this in mind. We propose a resilient consensus protocol that incorporates trust observations from the channel and weighs them with a parameter that accounts for how confident an agent is regarding its understanding of the legitimacy of other agents in the network, with no need for the initial observation window $T_0$ that has been utilized in previous works. Analytical and numerical results show that (i) our protocol achieves a resilient consensus in the presence of malicious agents and (ii) the steady-state deviation from nominal consensus can be minimized by a suitable choice of the confidence parameter that depends on the statistics of trust observations.</description>

      <title>Q-ITAGS: Quality-Optimized Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneous Task Allocation with a Time Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex multi-objective missions require the coordination of heterogeneous robots at multiple inter-connected levels, such as coalition formation, scheduling, and motion planning. The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</description>

      <title>WESE: Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation for LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential as an intelligent agent. However, existing researches mainly focus on enhancing the agent's reasoning or decision-making abilities through well-designed prompt engineering or task-specific fine-tuning, ignoring the procedure of exploration and exploitation. When addressing complex tasks within open-world interactive environments, these methods exhibit limitations. Firstly, the lack of global information of environments leads to greedy decisions, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. On the other hand, irrelevant information acquired from the environment not only adversely introduces noise, but also incurs additional cost. This paper proposes a novel approach, Weak Exploration to Strong Exploitation (WESE), to enhance LLM agents in solving open-world interactive tasks. Concretely, WESE involves decoupling the exploration and exploitation process, employing a cost-effective weak agent to perform exploration tasks for global knowledge. A knowledge graph-based strategy is then introduced to store the acquired knowledge and extract task-relevant knowledge, enhancing the stronger agent in success rate and efficiency for the exploitation task. Our approach is flexible enough to incorporate diverse tasks, and obtains significant improvements in both success rates and efficiency across four interactive benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (multi-agent RL) with differential privacy (DP) constraints. This is well-motivated by various real-world applications involving sensitive data, where it is critical to protect users' private information. We first extend the definitions of Joint DP (JDP) and Local DP (LDP) to two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games, where both definitions ensure trajectory-wise privacy protection. Then we design a provably efficient algorithm based on optimistic Nash value iteration and privatization of Bernstein-type bonuses. The algorithm is able to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements when instantiated with appropriate privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, for both notions of DP, our regret bound generalizes the best known result under the single-agent RL case, while our regret could also reduce to the best known result for multi-agent RL without privacy constraints. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first line of results towards understanding trajectory-wise privacy protection in multi-agent RL.</description>

      <title>Introducing Delays in Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) setting where agents have been assigned a plan, but during its execution some agents are delayed. Instead of replanning from scratch when such a delay occurs, we propose delay introduction, whereby we delay some additional agents so that the remainder of the plan can be executed safely. We show that finding the minimum number of additional delays is APX-Hard, i.e., it is NP-Hard to find a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$. However, in practice we can find optimal delay-introductions using Conflict-Based Search for very large numbers of agents, and both planning time and the resulting length of the plan are comparable, and sometimes outperform the state-of-the-art heuristics for replanning.</description>

      <title>Short vs. Long-term Coordination of Drones: When Distributed Optimization Meets Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Swarms of autonomous interactive drones, with the support of recharging technology, can provide compelling sensing capabilities in Smart Cities, such as traffic monitoring and disaster response. This paper aims to deliver a novel coordination solution for the cost-effective navigation, sensing, and recharging of drones. Existing approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), offer long-term adaptability, but lack energy efficiency, resilience, and flexibility in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach where each drone independently determines its flying direction and recharging place using DRL, while adapting navigation and sensing through distributed optimization, which improves energy-efficiency during sensing tasks. Furthermore, drones efficiently exchange information while retaining decision-making autonomy via a structured tree communication model. Extensive experimentation with datasets generated from realistic urban mobility underscores an outstanding performance of the proposed solution compared to state-of-the-art methods. Significant new insights show that long-term methods optimize scarce drone resource for traffic management, while the integration of short-term methods is crucial for advising on charging policies and maintaining battery safety.</description>

      <title>Group Decision-Making among Privacy-Aware Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08156v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can individuals exchange information to learn from each other despite their privacy needs and security concerns? For example, consider individuals deliberating a contentious topic and being concerned about divulging their private experiences. Preserving individual privacy and enabling efficient social learning are both important desiderata but seem fundamentally at odds with each other and very hard to reconcile. We do so by controlling information leakage using rigorous statistical guarantees that are based on differential privacy (DP). Our agents use log-linear rules to update their beliefs after communicating with their neighbors. Adding DP randomization noise to beliefs provides communicating agents with plausible deniability with regard to their private information and their network neighborhoods. We consider two learning environments one for distributed maximum-likelihood estimation given a finite number of private signals and another for online learning from an infinite, intermittent signal stream. Noisy information aggregation in the finite case leads to interesting tradeoffs between rejecting low-quality states and making sure all high-quality states are accepted in the algorithm output. Our results flesh out the nature of the trade-offs in both cases between the quality of the group decision outcomes, learning accuracy, communication cost, and the level of privacy protections that the agents are afforded.</description>

      <title>Optimal Task Assignment and Path Planning using Conflict-Based Search with Precedence and Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem entails finding collision-free paths for a set of agents, guiding them from their start to goal locations. However, MAPF does not account for several practical task-related constraints. For example, agents may need to perform actions at goal locations with specific execution times, adhering to predetermined orders and timeframes. Moreover, goal assignments may not be predefined for agents, and the optimization objective may lack an explicit definition. To incorporate task assignment, path planning, and a user-defined objective into a coherent framework, this paper examines the Task Assignment and Path Finding with Precedence and Temporal Constraints (TAPF-PTC) problem. We augment Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to simultaneously generate task assignments and collision-free paths that adhere to precedence and temporal constraints, maximizing an objective quantified by the return from a user-defined reward function in reinforcement learning (RL). Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm, CBS-TA-PTC, can solve highly challenging bomb-defusing tasks with precedence and temporal constraints efficiently relative to MARL and adapted Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) methods.</description>
