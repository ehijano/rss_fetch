Abstract: In the present work we will give an explicit solution the problem of divergence of propgator of gauge-invariant Siegel-Zwiebach (SZ) action in Fierz-Pauli (FP) gauge (also called van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity) by connecting it's Green's functions to that of Transverse-Traceless (TT) gauge using improved finite-field-dependent BRST (FFBRST) method.</description>

      <title>Observable Signatures of No-Scale Supergravity in NANOGrav</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of NANOGrav data we provide for the first time possible observational signatures of Superstring theory. Firstly, we work with inflection-point inflationary potentials naturally realised within Wess-Zumino type no-scale Supergravity, which give rise to the formation of microscopic primordial black holes (PBHs) triggering an early matter-dominated era (eMD) and evaporating before Big Bang Nucleosythesis (BBN). Remarkably, we obtain an abundant production of primordial gravitational waves (PGW) at the frequency ranges of nHz, Hz and kHz and in strong agreement with Pulsar Time Array (PTA) GW data. This PGW background could serve as a compelling observational signature for the presence of quantum gravity via no-scale Supergravity.</description>

      <title>Topological recursion for hyperbolic string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an analog of Mirzakhani's recursion relation for hyperbolic string vertices and investigate its implications for closed string field theory. Central to our construction are systolic volumes: the Weil-Petersson volumes of regions in moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces whose elements have systoles $L \geq 0$. These volumes can be shown to satisfy a recursion relation through a modification of Mirzakhani's recursion as long as $L \leq 2 \sinh^{-1} 1$. Applying the pants decomposition of Riemann surfaces to off-shell string amplitudes, we promote this recursion to hyperbolic string field theory and demonstrate the higher order vertices are determined by the cubic vertex iteratively for any background. Such structure implies the solutions of closed string field theory obey a quadratic integral equation. We illustrate the utility of our approach in an example of a stubbed scalar theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic curvature divergences and non-gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse divergences of the scalar curvature $R$ of the vector multiplet moduli space of type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi--Yau $X$, along infinite-distance large volume limits. Extending previous results, we classify the origin of the divergence along trajectories which implement decompactifications to F-theory on $X$ and/or emergent heterotic string limits. In all cases, the curvature divergence can be traced back to a 4d rigid field theory that decouples from gravity along the limit. This can be quantified via the asymptotic relation $R \sim (\Lambda_{\rm WGC}/\Lambda_{\rm sp})^{2\nu}$, with $\Lambda_{\rm WGC} \equiv g_{\rm rigid} M_{\rm P}$ and $\Lambda_{\rm sp}$ the species scale. In the UV, the 4d rigid field theory becomes a higher-dimensional, strongly-coupled rigid theory that also decouples from gravity. The nature of this UV theory is encoded in the exponent $\nu$, and it either corresponds to a 5d SCFT, 6d SCFT or a Little String Theory.</description>

      <title>An effective framework for strange metallic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-holography, originally proposed as a model for conducting lattice electrons coupled to a holographic critical sector, leads to an effective theory of non-Fermi liquids with only a few relevant interactions on the Fermi surface in the large $N$ limit. A refined version of such theories has only two effective couplings which give holographic and Fermi-liquid-like contributions to the self-energy, respectively. We show that a low co-dimension sub-manifold exists in the space of refined semi-holographic theories in which strange metallic behavior is manifested, and which can be obtained just by tuning the ratio of the two couplings. On this sub-manifold, the product of the spectral function and the temperature is approximately independent of the critical exponent, the Fermi energy, and the temperature at all frequencies and near the Fermi surface when expressed in terms of suitably scaled momentum and frequency variables. This quasi-universal behavior leads to linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity and Planckian dissipation over a large range of temperatures, and we also obtain $T^{-3}$ scaling of the Hall conductivity at higher temperatures. The quasi-universal spectral function also fits well with photoemission spectroscopic data without varying the critical exponent with the doping. Combining with the results for optical conductivity, we construct a generalized version of Drude phenomenology for strange-metallic behavior which satisfies non-trivial consistency tests. Finally, we discuss a possible dynamical mechanism for the fine-tuning of the ratio of the two couplings necessary to realize the strange metallic behavior in a typical state.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Infrared Conformal Generators on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conformal algebra on the fuzzy sphere, and in particular the generators of translations and special conformal transformations which are emergent symmetries in the infinite IR but are broken along the RG flow. We show how to extract these generators using the energy momentum tensor, which is complicated by the fact that one does not have a priori access to the energy momentum tensor of the CFT limit but rather must construct it numerically. We discuss and quantitatively analyze the main sources of corrections to the conformal generators due to the breaking of scale-invariance at finite energy, and develop efficient methods for removing these corrections. The resulting generators have matrix elements that match CFT predictions with accuracy varying from sub-percent level for the lowest-lying states up to several percent accuracy for states with dimension $\sim 5$ with $N=16$ fermions. We show that the generators can be used to accurately identify primary operators vs descendant operators in energy ranges where the spectrum is too dense to do the identification solely based on the approximate integer spacing within conformal multiplets.</description>

      <title>Singletons in supersymmetric field theories and in supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $N=1$ supergravity coupled to a Wess-Zumino multiplet with a potential such that the resulting AdS energies saturate the unitarity and Breitenlohner-Freedman bounds, respectively. Imposing regular boundary conditions that preserve supersymmetry and support finite norms, the spectrum forms an $OSp(1,4)$ supermultiplet in which the singleton representation is absent. We study the case in which this boundary condition is relaxed such that the singleton and its superpartners survive and form an indecomposable representation of $OSp(1,4)$. Focusing on the global limit of the model, we carry out its holographic renormalization, in which a singletonic action makes appearance in the boundary action.</description>

      <title>Black hole singularity resolution from unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of an interior planar AdS (anti-de Sitter) black hole, requiring unitarity in the natural time coordinate conjugate to the cosmological "constant of motion" appearing in unimodular gravity. Both the classical singularity and the horizon are replaced by a non-singular highly quantum region; semiclassical notions of spacetime evolution are only valid in an intermediate region. For the singularity, our results should be applicable to general black holes: unitarity in unimodular time always implies singularity resolution.</description>

      <title>Glauber-Sudarshan States, Wave Functional of the Universe and the Wheeler-De Witt equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the pertinent question in the analysis of de Sitter as an excited state is what happens to the Glauber-Sudarshan states that are off-shell, i.e. the states that do not satisfy the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We argue that these Glauber-Sudarshan states, including the on-shell ones, are controlled by a bigger envelope wave functional namely a wave functional of the universe which surprisingly satisfies a Wheeler-De Witt equation. We provide various justification of the aforementioned identification including the determination of the emergent Hamiltonian constraint appearing in the Wheeler-De Witt equation that is satisfied by both the on- and off-shell states. Our analysis provides further evidence of why a transient four-dimensional de Sitter phase in string theory should be viewed as an excited state over a supersymmetric warped Minkowski background and not as a vacuum state.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensate in a holographic dilute nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study chiral condensate in cold nuclear matter on the basis of holographic theory, which would be dual to a baryon system in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the confinement phase. Our model is a holographic model based on the D$3$/D$7$ branes. The magnitude of the chiral condensate obtained in our model is found to gradually increase with increasing baryon density $n$ within the range of the dilute nucleon gas, $n&lt;1$, where our model is available. This is a result for the chiral condensate in the holographic model as a function of $n$, which can be compared to the chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform folding on the ADHM construction of the instanton moduli space from $SU$ to $SO$ group. A Young diagram description for the $SO$ instanton is obtained after modifying the real and complex moment maps of the ADHM data. We study the Bethe gauge correspondence between type D relativistic Toda lattice and 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ folded theory. In particular we prove that the regular monodromy defect in the folded gauge theory is the stationary wavefunction of the type D relativistic Toda lattice.</description>

      <title>Two-field models in the presence of impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with systems of two real scalar fields coupled to impurity functions, meant to model inhomogeneities often encountered in real physical applications. We investigate the theoretical properties of these systems and some of the consequences of impurity doping. We show that the theory may be modified in a way that preserves some BPS sectors, while also greatly impacting the behavior and internal structure of the solution, and exemplify those results with a investigation of a few interesting models in which impurities are coupled to a theory with a quartic potential. It is shown that, in the presence of impurities, the asymptotic behavior of field configurations may be changed, leading to solutions with different long-range properties, which are relevant to several physical applications. Our examples also highlight other important consequences that may follow from the addition of impurities, such as the presence of zero-modes that can significantly change the internal structure of a given solution without altering its energy, the creation of new topological sectors that did not exist in the impurity-free theory, and the possibility of stable, nontrivial configurations generated by topologically trivial boundary conditions. We have also shown that it is sometimes possible to find energy minimizers in BPS sectors which were unpopulated in the canonical theory. These features show that impurities allow for significant flexibility in both the form of energy minimizers and the boundary conditions used to generate them, which may potentially broaden the range of applicability of the theory.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically-defined higher-derivative Carrollian scalar field theories without Ostrogradsky instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the most generic Carrollian higher derivative free scalar field theory intrinsically on a Carrollian manifold. The solutions to these theories are massless free particles propagating with speeds depending on the coupling constants in the Lagrangian, thus, allowing interference solutions which are not allowed on a Lorentzian manifold. This demonstrates that the set of solutions to the Carrollian theories is much larger than that of their Lorentzian counterparts. We also show that Carrollian higher derivative theories are more resistant to Ostrogradsky's instabilities. These instabilities can be resolved by choosing the coupling constants appropriately in the Carrollian Lagrangian, something that was proven to be impossible in Lorentzian theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the duality group for $\mathcal N=2$ $\widehat{A}_n$-shaped quivers SCFTs and generalize it to the previously unexplored case of $\widehat{D}_n$-shaped quivers. We then provide a systematic description of non-invertible duality symmetries in both classes. Furthermore, we characterize the $\mathcal N=1$ mass deformations of these theories that preserve such symmetries, thereby identifying a large class of $\mathcal N=1$ SCFTs with non-invertible duality symmetries inherited from their parent $\mathcal N=2$ theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in the Regge limit, in terms of the CFT data of the exchanged operators in the leading Regge trajectory. To any order in the small curvature expansion, the result can be written in terms of derivatives of the flat space Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in the Regge limit. The result also admits an integral representation involving single-valued logarithms, fully consistent with recent proposals for the full AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Black holes in Lorentz gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10100v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole solutions are explored in the Lorentz gauge theory of gravity. The fields of the theory are the gauge potential in the adjoint and a scalar in the fundamental representation of the Lorentz group, a metric tensor then emerging as a composite field in a symmetry-broken phase. Three distinct such phases of the theory are considered. In an SO(3) phase, the fundamental field is identified with a generalised Painlev\'e-Gullstrand-Lema\^itre coordinate time. In the static spherically symmetric case it is a stealth scalar, and the general vacuum solution is then parameterised by two constants, one related to the black hole mass and the other to an observer. Also, formulations of pregeometric first order electromagnetism are considered in order to construct a consistent realisation of a charged black hole. In an SO(1,2) phase of the theory, the Schwarzschild solution is realised as a configuration wherein the fundamental field is real outside and imaginary inside the horizon. In this phase the field can be associated with an effective radial pressure resulting in additional singularities and asymptotic non-flatness. Finally, a symmetry-broken phase which would correspond to solutions in an alternative attempt at a Lorentz gauge theory is shown to be incompatible with black holes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement content of kink excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum one-dimensional systems in their ordered phase admit kinks as elementary excitations above their symmetry-broken vacua. While the scattering properties of the kinks resemble those of quasiparticles, they have distinct locality features that are manifest in their entanglement content. In this work, we study the entanglement entropy of kink excitations. We first present detailed calculations for specific states of a spin-1/2 chain to highlight the salient features of these excitations. Second, we provide a field-theoretic framework based on the algebraic relations between the twist fields and the semilocal fields associated with the excitations, and we compute the R\'enyi entropies in this framework. We obtain universal predictions for the entropy difference between the excited states with a finite number of kinks and the symmetry-broken ground states, which do not depend on the microscopic details of the model in the limit of large regions. Finally, we discuss some consequences of the Kramers-Wannier duality, which relates the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, and we explain why, counterintuitively, no explicit relations between those phases are found at the level of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Delving into the Phenomenology of Very Special Relativity: From Subatomic Particles to Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we investigate the implications of Lorentz-violating (LV) theories, focusing on Very Special Relativity (VSR) and its phenomenological consequences. Initially presented as an alternative mechanism for neutrino masses, VSR has since become a significant part of the general LV framework, distinguished by its unique group structure and non-local operators. After a comprehensive introduction to the principles of LV and VSR, we present the corresponding modifications to the Dirac equation. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of a Hamiltonian formalism within the VSR context, addressing its inherent non-localities. This approach is further extended to the non-relativistic limit, connecting it to the conventional Schr\"odinger picture. We then set upper bounds on the VSR parameters by examining its corrections to a wide range of physical systems and scenarios, such as Landau levels of charged particles, the $\mathsf g-$factor of electrons, the energy spectrum of ultracold neutrons in Earth's gravitational field, and the gravitational emission from binary stars. The latter analysis led us to the construction of a VSR field theory for spin-2 fields in flat space, which was surprisingly found to accommodate a gauge-invariant graviton mass. Through this comprehensive study, we bridged theoretical predictions with experimental data, paving the way for future explorations in Lorentz-violating theories and highlighting their potential to address unresolved questions in modern physics.</description>

      <title>The first law of binary black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the first law of binary black hole mechanics played an important unifying role in the gravitational two-body problem. More recently, binary black hole scattering and the application of high-energy physics methods have provided a new avenue into this classical problem. In this Letter, we connect these two themes by extending the first law to the case of scattering orbits. We present derivations based on classical S-matrix, Hamiltonian, and pseudo-Hamiltonian methods, the last of which allows us to include dissipative effects for the first time. Finally, a "boundary to bound" map links this first law to the traditional bound-orbit version. Through this map a little-known observable for scatter orbits, the elapsed proper time, is mapped to the Detweiler redshift for bound orbits.</description>

      <title>Building blocks for $W$-algebras of classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,3,4,\dots)$ serves as a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,3,\dots,N)$ for some $N$ in the sense that under mild hypothesis, all such vertex algebras arise as quotients of $W_{\infty}$. There is an $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ family of such $1$-parameter vertex algebras known as $Y$-algebras. They were introduced by Gaiotto and Rap\v{c}\'ak and are expected to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras in type $A$, i.e., every $W$-(super) algebra in type $A$ is an extension of a tensor product of finitely many $Y$-algebras. Similarly, the orthosymplectic $Y$-algebras are $1$-parameter quotients of a universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,4,6,\dots)$, which is a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$. Unlike type $A$, these algebras are not all the building blocks for $W$-algebras of types $B$, $C$, and $D$. In this paper, we construct a new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra of type $W(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4, 5^3,6,\dots)$ which we denote by $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ since it contains a copy of the affine vertex algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_2)$. We identify $8$ infinite families of $1$-parameter quotients of $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are analogues of the $Y$-algebras. We regard $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ as a fundamental object on equal footing with $W_{\infty}$ and $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and we give some heuristic reasons for why we expect the $1$-parameter quotients of these three objects to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras of classical types. Finally, we prove that $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ has many quotients which are strongly rational. This yields new examples of strongly rational $W$-superalgebras.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank 2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Knot Floer Homology.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity effects on particle creation and evaporation in a non-commutative black hole via mass deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a gravitational non-commutative black hole by gauging the de Sitter SO(4,1) group and employing the Seiberg-Witten map. Specifically, we examine modifications of non-commutativity represented through mass deformation. Initially, we address modifications to Hawking radiation for bosonic particle modes by analyzing the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetimes. We compute the Bogoliubov coefficients, showing how $\Theta$ introduces a correction to the amplitude associated with particle creation. Additionally, we derive the power spectrum and the Hawking temperature within this framework. We also derive Hawking radiation from a tunneling perspective, leading to expressions for the power spectrum and particle number density. A similar analysis is performed for fermion particles. Remarkably, we obtain an analytical expression for black hole evaporation lifetime and compare our results with recent estimates of non-commutativity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f&gt;1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum complexity has emerged as a central concept in diverse areas of physics, ranging from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. We perform a systematic study of complexity in random quantum circuits with and without measurements. We observe that complexity grows linearly before saturating to a constant value. For $N$ qubits without measurements, the saturation value scales as $2^{N-1}$, and the saturation time scales as $2^N$. This behaviour remains identical in the presence of random measurements with different probabilities, indicating that this notion of complexity is insensitive to the rate of measurement. We also study the behaviour of complexity in two variants of the random unitary floquet circuit, where we observe that complexity acts as a novel probe of Anderson localization and many-body localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, partially using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights given by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, these constraints are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix of parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). A simple example of this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for a manifestly Lorentz-covariant spinor wave-packet basis. The traditional definition of the spinor wave packet is problematic due to its unavoidable mixing with other wave packets under Lorentz transformations. Our approach resolves this inherent mixing issue. The wave packet we develop constitutes a complete set, enabling the expansion of a free spinor field while maintaining Lorentz covariance. Additionally, we present a Lorentz-invariant expression for zero-point energy.</description>

Abstract: We show that supersymmetry can be used to compute the BCFT one-point function coefficients for chiral primary operators, in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs with $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS boundary conditions. The main ingredient is the hemisphere partition function, with the boundary condition on the equatorial $S^3$. A supersymmetric Ward identity relates derivatives with respect to the chiral coupling constants to the insertion of the primaries at the pole of the hemisphere. Exact results for the one-point functions can be then obtained in terms of the localization matrix model. We discuss in detail the example of the super Maxwell theory in the bulk, interacting with 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs on the boundary. In particular we derive the action of the SL(2,$\mathbb{Z}$) duality on the one-point functions.</description>

Abstract: In JT gravity coupled to a CFT, I argue without using the path integral that the entanglement wedge of a boundary region is bounded by a quantum extremal surface (QES). For any candidate not bounded by a QES, a unitary in the complement can make reconstruction within the candidate inconsistent with boundary causality. The case without islands is a direct consequence of subregion duality, and the case with islands can also be dealt with with a stronger assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies, in the context of consistency conditions for rapid-turn and third order slow-roll inflation in two-field models, raised the question whether this regime can be sustained for more than a few e-folds of expansion. We answer this question in the affirmative by showing that the consistency conditions themselves ensure the longevity of the rapid-turn regime. Furthermore, we prove this for the most general definition of rapid turning (i.e., with a turning rate that is large compared to the slow-roll parameters, but not necessarily large compared to unity), using in the process a generalized consistency condition. We also show that a special class of rapid-turn models, including angular inflation, satisfy a large-(compared to $1$)-turn-rate condition even for non-large turning rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tree-level string effective action reduced from $D$ to $D-d$ dimensions possesses a continuous $O(d,d)$ symmetry, closely related to T-duality. A necessary condition for a higher derivative correction to preserve this symmetry is that certain $O(d,d)$ violating terms which appear in the dimensional reduction have to cancel out. We use this idea to complete the quartic Riemann correction with all terms involving five NS-NS sector fields. The resulting Lagrangian is considerably simpler than expressions that have previously appeared in the literature.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>

      <title>A free field approach to $\widehat{g}_{k}$ and parafermionic $\widehat{g}_{k}/\widehat{u(1)}^{r}$ Ishibashi states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work \cite{Liu:2023gzf}, I proposed a method to challenge the calculations of genus-$g$, bulk $n$-point, $b$-boundary, $c$-crosscap functions with $x$ boundary operators $\mathcal{F}_{g,n,b,c}^{x}$ of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$) by expanding them as infinite linear combinations of genus-$g$, $(n+b+c)$-point bulk correlation functions. Applying free field resolutions of chiral modules is an effective method for obtaining infinite linear coefficients in the expansion. We review free field resolution conjectures of dominant irreducible $\widehat{g}_{k}$ highest-weight modules and higher-rank parafermionic $\widehat{g}_{k}/ \widehat{u(1)}^{r}$ modules \cite{Bouwknegt:1989xa, Bouwknegt:1990fb, Bouwknegt:1990wa}, and apply them to corresponding Ishibashi states.</description>

      <title>Repeated measurements on non-replicable systems and their consequences for Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Born rule describes the probability of obtaining an outcome when measuring an observable of a quantum system. As it can only be tested by measuring many copies of the system under consideration, it does not hold for non-replicable systems. For these systems, we give a procedure to predict the future statistics of measurement outcomes through Repeated Measurements (RM). This is done by extending the validity of quantum mechanics to those systems admitting no replicas; we prove that if the statistics of the results acquired by performing RM on such systems is sufficiently similar to that obtained by the Born rule, the latter can be used effectively. We apply our framework to a repeatedly measured Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar quantum field, which is an example of a system (detector) interacting with an uncontrollable environment (field) for which using RM is necessary. Analysing what an observer learns from the RM outcomes, we find a regime where history-dependent RM probabilities are close to the Born ones. Consequently, the latter can be used for all practical purposes. Finally, we numerically study inertial and accelerated detectors, showing that an observer can see the Unruh effect via RM.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravity waves from ultra slow-roll Galileon inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of {\it quantum ratio} emerged in the recent efforts to understand how Newton's equations appear for the center of mass (CM) of an isolated macroscopic body at finite body-temperatures, as the first approximation to quantum-mechanical equations. It is defined as $Q\equiv R_q/L_0$, where the quantum fluctuation range $R_q$ is the spatial extension of the pure-state CM wave function, whereas $L_0$ stands for the body's linear size (the space support of the internal, bound-state wave function). The two cases $R_q /L_0 \lesssim 1$ or $R_q/ L_0 \gg 1$, roughly correspond to the body's CM behaving classically or quantum mechanically, respectively. In the present note we elaborate more on this concept, illustrating it in several examples. An important notion following from introduction of the quantum ratio is that the elementary particles (thus the electron and the photon) are quantum mechanical, even when the environment-induced decoherence turns them into a mixed state. Decoherence and classical state should not be identified. This simple observation, further illustrated by the consideration of a few atomic or molecular processes, may have significant implications on the way quantum mechanics works in biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the tensor bispectrum mediated by an excited scalar field during inflation and find that the bispectrum peaks in the squeezed configuration, which is different from that of gravitational waves induced by enhanced curvature perturbations re-entering the horizon in the radiation-dominated era. Measuring the bispectrum provides a promising way to distinguish the stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during inflation from that generated after inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nilpotence variety for extended supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a cone over a quadric in projective space. The pure spinor correspondence, which relates the description of off-shell supermultiplets to the classification of modules over the corresponding hypersurface ring, reduces to a classical problem of linear algebra. Spinor bundles, which correspond to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, serve as basic building blocks. Koszul duality appears as a deformed version of the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence that we make fully concrete. We illustrate in numerous examples the close relationship between these connections and the powerful graphical technology of Adinkras, which appear as a decategorification of special complexes on quadrics. We emphasize the role of R-symmetry for recovering higher-dimensional gauge and gravity multiplets.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Data reconstruction of the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ Hubble data and Gaussian Processes in order to reconstruct the dynamical connection function in $f(Q)$ cosmology beyond the coincident gauge. In particular, there exist three branches of connections that satisfy the torsionless and curvatureless conditions, parameterized by a new dynamical function $\gamma$. We express the redshift dependence of $\gamma$ in terms of the $H(z)$ function and the $f(Q)$ form and parameters, and then we reconstruct it using 55 $H(z)$ observation data. Firstly, we investigate the case where ordinary conservation law holds, and we reconstruct the $f(Q)$ function, which is very well described by a quadratic correction on top of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. Proceeding to the general case, we consider two of the most studied $f(Q)$ models of the literature, namely the square-root and the exponential one. In both cases we reconstruct $\gamma(z)$, and we show that according to AIC and BIC information criteria its inclusion is favoured compared to both $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, as well as to the same $f(Q)$ models under the coincident gauge. This feature acts as an indication that $f(Q)$ cosmology should be studied beyond the coincident gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $1/2$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space $CP^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin j (a 2j+1 -state system) for generic j is represented instead by a point of a larger space, $CP^{2j}$. Here we study the angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The state, $(J \cdot n) | j, n\rangle = j |j, n \rangle $, where $J$ is the angular momentum operator and $n$ stands for a generic unit vector in $R^3$, is found to behave as a classical angular momentum, $ j n $. We discuss this phenomenon, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. This problem arose from the consideration of a macroscopic body under an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our observations help to explain how classical mechanics (with unique particle trajectories) emerges naturally from quantum mechanics in this context, and at the same time, make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, a more precise one.</description>

      <title>A Review of Stable, Traversable Wormholes in f (R) Gravity Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proven that in standard Einstein gravity, exotic matter is required to stabilize traversable wormholes. Quantum field theory permits these violations due to the quantum coherent effects found in any quantum field. Even reasonable classical scalar fields violate the energy conditions. In the case of the Casimir effect and squeezed vacuum states, these violations have been experimentally proven. It is advantageous to investigate methods to minimize the use of exotic matter. One such area of interest is extended theories of Einstein gravity. It has been claimed that in some extended theories, stable traversable wormholes solutions can be found without the use of exotic matter. There are many extended theories of gravity, and in this review paper, we first explore modified gravity theories and then explore some wormhole solutions in such theories, including Lovelock gravity and Einstein Dilaton Gauss Bonnet gravity. For completeness, we have also reviewed other wormholes such as Casimir wormholes, dark matter halo wormholes, thin-shell wormholes, and Nonlocal Gravity wormholes, where alternative techniques are used to either avoid or reduce the amount of exotic matter that is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid-turn slow-roll inflationary trajectories have been shown to be an attractor in two-field models, provided the turn rate is near constant and larger than the slow-roll parameters. These trajectories can produce primordial spectra consistent with current observations on CMB scales. We present the generalized consistency condition for sustained rapid-turn inflationary trajectory with two fields, arbitrary field-space metric and potential valid for any value of the turn rate. This has to be supplemented by a second condition to ensure slow roll evolution. Both conditions together constitute a tool to identify inflationary trajectories with arbitrary values of the turning rate without having to solve the equations of motion. We present a Python package for the numerical identification of regions in field-space and parameter space that allow for rapid-turn trajectories.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Functional measures associated to operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every operator in $L^{2}$ has an associated measure on a space of functions and prove that it can be used to find solutions to abstract Cauchy problems, including partial differential equations. We find explicit formulas to compute the integral of functions with respect to this measure and develop approximate formulas in terms of a perturbative expansion. We show that this method can be used to represent solutions of classical equations, such as the diffusion and Fokker-Plank equations, as Wiener and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jansen-de Dominics integrals, and propose an extension to paths in infinite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>QCD Masterclass Lectures on Jet Physics and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lectures were presented at the 2024 QCD Masterclass in Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, France. They introduce and review fundamental theorems and principles of machine learning within the context of collider particle physics, focused on application to jet identification and discrimination. Numerous examples of binary discrimination in jet physics are studied in detail, including $H\to b\bar b$ identification in fixed-order perturbation theory, generic one-versus two-prong discrimination with parametric power counting techniques, and up versus down quark jet classification by assuming the central limit theorem, isospin conservation, and a convergent moment expansion of the single particle energy distribution. Quark versus gluon jet discrimination is considered in multiple contexts, from using additive, infrared and collinear safe observables, to using hadronic multiplicity, and to including measurements of the jet charge. While many of the results presented here are well known, some novel results are presented, the most prominent being a parametrized expression for the likelihood ratio of quark versus gluon discrimination for jets on which hadronic multiplicity and jet charge are simultaneously measured. End-of-lecture exercises are also provided.</description>

      <title>Landauer's principle and black hole area quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article assesses Landauer's principle from information theory in the context of area quantization of the Schwarzschild black hole. Within a quantum-mechanical perspective where Hawking evaporation can be interpreted in terms of transitions between the discrete states of the area (or mass) spectrum, we justify that Landauer's principle holds consistently in the saturated form when the number of microstates of the black hole goes as $2^n$, where $n$ is a large positive integer labeling the levels of the area/mass spectrum in the semiclassical regime. This is equivalent to the area spacing $\Delta A = \alpha l_P^2$ (in natural units), where $\alpha = 4 \ln 2$ for which the entropy spacing between consecutive levels in Boltzmann units coincides exactly with one bit of information. We also comment on the situation for other values of $\alpha$ prevalent in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical dualities in arbitrary dimensions are understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. By these results, we rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic "modulating" translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>
