      <title>Lattice outlook on $B\to\rho\ell\bar{\nu}$ and $B\to K^\star \ell \ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has significantly contributed to our understanding of the CKM matrix through precise determinations of hadronic matrix elements. With advancements in theoretical methodologies and computational resources, investigations can now extend to processes involving QCD-unstable hadrons such as the $\rho$ and $K^\star(892)$. These resonances play vital roles in processes such as weak decays of $B$ mesons, opening new avenues for exploration. Finite-volume lattice QCD techniques involving complex computational methods are used to determine the transition amplitudes. Here, we present preliminary results for $B\to\rho\ell\bar{\nu}$.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Do near-threshold molecular states mix with neighboring $\bar QQ$ states?"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I comment on a paper by Christoph Hanhart and Alexey Nefediev, published in Phys. Rev. D 106, 114003 (2022). The authors discuss the interpretation of mesons close to their lowest decay threshold and present a mechanism for the formation of molecular states. The proposed formalism is then applied to the axial-vector mesons $D_{s1}(2536)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, presenting two scenarios for the lighter meson, namely a $D^\star K$ molecule or a compact $c\bar{s}$ state. The authors argue that the latter hypothesis requires a fine-tuning of the mixing angle between the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ and $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ $C$-parity eigenstates.
  In this Comment I show that no such fine-tuning is needed, as demonstrated in an article published in Phys. Rev. D 84, 094020 (2011), where a unitarized quark model was applied to the two $C$-parity eigenstates, coupled to several two-meson channels including $D^\star K$. The coupled-channel dynamics naturally leads to a mixing angle very close to the required one. Moreover, I argue that the $D_1(2420)$ and $D_1(2430)$ axial-vectors, not considered by the authors, as well as a lattice simulation in Phys. Rev. D 90, 034510 (2014), also not mentioned by the authors, do not lend support to a molecular interpretation of the $D_{s1}(2460)$. I conclude with some more general remarks about mesons coupling to $S$-wave thresholds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in $2+1$D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars has been established across different quantum many-body systems, including spin-1/2 Quantum Link Models. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, concretely for Truncated Link Models, where the electric field is truncated rather than replaced by spins. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ Quantum Link Models. The proposed analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Analysis of $B\to K^{(*)}$ and $B_s\to \phi$ Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stronger formulation of the dispersive (or unitarity) bounds \`a la Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL), which are commonly applied in analyses of the hadronic form factors for $B$ decays. In our approach, the existing bounds are split into several new bounds, thereby disentangling form factors that are jointly bounded in the common approach. This leads to stronger constraints for these objects, to a significant simplification of our numerical analysis, and to the removal of spurious correlations among the form factors. We apply these novel bounds to $\bar{B}\to \bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \phi$ form factors by fitting them to purely theoretical constraints. Using a suitable parametrization, we take into account the form factors' below-threshold branch cuts arising from on-shell $\bar{B}_s \pi^0$ and $\bar{B}_s \pi^0 \pi^0$ states, which so-far have been ignored in the literature. In this way, we eliminate a source of hard-to-quantify systematic uncertainties. We provide machine readable files to obtain the full set of the $\bar{B}\to \bar{K}^{(*)}$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \phi$ form factors in and beyond the entire semileptonic phase space.</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetry and chiral transport in real-time lattice $U(1)$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical lattice simulations of theories of electrodynamics coupled to charged matter at finite temperature, interpreting them using the higher-form symmetry formulation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We compute transport coefficients using classical Kubo formulas on the lattice and show that the properties of the simulated plasma are in complete agreement with the predictions from effective field theories. In particular, the higher-form formulation allows us to understand from hydrodynamic considerations the relaxation rate of axial charge in the chiral plasma observed in previous simulations. A key point is that the resistivity of the plasma -- defined in terms of Kubo formulas for the electric field in the 1-form formulation of MHD -- remains a well-defined and predictive quantity at strong electromagnetic coupling. However, the Kubo formulas used to define the conventional conductivity vanish at low frequencies due to electrodynamic fluctuations, and thus the concept of the conductivity of a gauged electric current must be interpreted with care.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in $2+1$D Gauge Theories with Dynamical Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) has emerged as an intriguing paradigm of weak ergodicity breaking in nonintegrable quantum many-body models, particularly lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in $1+1$ spacetime dimensions. However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{&gt;}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic. Our results further shed light on the intimate connection between gauge invariance and QMBS, and highlight the persistence of scarring in higher spatial dimensions. Our findings can be tested in near-term analog and digital quantum simulators, and we demonstrate their accessibility on a recently proposed cold-atom analog quantum simulator.</description>

      <title>The Wilson-Fisher Fixed point revisited: importance of the form of the cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we re-examine the Wilson Fisher fixed point. We study Wilsonian momentum space renormalization group (RG) flow for various forms of the cutoff. We show that already at order $\left(4-d\right)^{1}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the $\phi^{4}$ theory, there are changes to the position of the fixed point and the direction of irrelevant coupling parameters. We also show in a multi-flavor $\phi^{4}$ model that symmetries of the Lagrange function can be destroyed if the different flavors have different cutoffs (that is the Lagrangian can flow to a non-symmetric fixed point). Some related comments are made about a similar situation in parquet RG (pRG). In future works we will study Wilsonian RG to order $\left(4-d\right)^{2}$ and find non-universal critical exponents that depend on the cutoff.</description>
