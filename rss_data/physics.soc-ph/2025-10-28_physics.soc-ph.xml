      <title>Diversity legitimizes science: Holding basic research in the physical sciences accountable to the public</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The American scientific community is reeling from funding cuts and policy directives that will debilitate scientific research and education. The underlying hostilities fueling these attacks have intensified in recent years as the COVID-19 pandemic increased suspicion of scientific experts and the institutional embrace of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in 2020 prompted a backlash along longstanding political fault lines. Under the banner of anti-elitism, opponents of science and DEI have formed a coalition that sees attacks on higher education as a strategic means to achieve their political ends. While some of their arguments contain legitimate criticisms, academics must resist these attacks that seek to dismantle higher education altogether. Instead, we should engage the public in our research process, build a scientific practice representative of and accountable to the communities we serve, and interrogate the aims of our work by critically studying the history of science.</description>

      <title>Matchings Under Biased and Correlated Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-institution stable matching model in which candidates from two distinct groups are evaluated using partially correlated signals that are group-biased. This extends prior work (which assumes institutions evaluate candidates in an identical manner) to a more realistic setting in which institutions rely on overlapping, but independently processed, criteria. These evaluations could consist of a variety of informative tools such as standardized tests, shared recommendation systems, or AI-based assessments with local noise. Two key parameters govern evaluations: the bias parameter $\beta \in (0,1]$, which models systematic disadvantage faced by one group, and the correlation parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$, which captures the alignment between institutional rankings. We study the representation ratio, i.e., the ratio of disadvantaged to advantaged candidates selected by the matching process in this setting. Focusing on a regime in which all candidates prefer the same institution, we characterize the large-market equilibrium and derive a closed-form expression for the resulting representation ratio. Prior work shows that when $\gamma = 1$, this ratio scales linearly with $\beta$. In contrast, we show that the representation ratio increases nonlinearly with $\gamma$ and even modest losses in correlation can cause sharp drops in the representation ratio. Our analysis identifies critical $\gamma$-thresholds where institutional selection behavior undergoes discrete transitions, and reveals structural conditions under which evaluator alignment or bias mitigation are most effective. Finally, we show how this framework and results enable interventions for fairness-aware design in decentralized selection systems.</description>

      <title>Ashkin-Teller model with antiferromagnetic four-spin interactions: Interference effect between two conflicting issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin systems have emerged as powerful tools for understanding collective phenomena in complex systems. In this work, we investigate the Ashkin--Teller (AT) model on random scale-free networks using mean-field theory, which extends the traditional Ising framework by coupling two spin systems via both pairwise and four-spin interactions. We focus on the previously unexplored antiferromagnetic regime of four-spin coupling, in which strong ordering in one layer actively suppresses the formation of order in the other layer. This mechanism captures, for example, scenarios in social or political systems where a dominant viewpoint on one issue (e.g., economic development) can inhibit consensus on another (e.g., environmental conservation). Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram with four distinct phases -- paramagnetic, Baxter, \langle \sigma \rangle, and antiferromagnetic -- and diverse types of phase transitions. Notably, we find that the upper critical degree exponent extends to \lambda_{c2} \approx 9.237, far exceeding the conventional value of \lambda = 5$ observed in ferromagnetic systems. This dramatic shift underscores the enhanced robustness of hub-mediated spin correlations under competitive coupling, leading to asymmetric order parameters between layers and novel phase transition phenomena. These findings offer fundamental insights into systems with competing order parameters and have direct implications for multilayer biological networks, social media ecosystems, and political debates characterized by competing priorities.</description>

      <title>Collective Motion from Quantum-Inspired Open Dynamics with Self-Perception Coupling: A Bloch Approximation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cognition, the perception of external stimuli and the self-referential awareness of one's own perceptual process are two distinct but interacting operations. We propose a quantum-inspired framework in which both the self state and the perception state are treated as coupled open quantum systems evolving across two different timescales. The fast perceptual subsystem captures adaptive sensing under coherent and dissipative influences, while the self subsystem evolves on a slower timescale, integrating perceptual feedback into a stable internal state. Their mutual coupling forms a closed informational loop, where the self-state biases perception, and perception continually reshapes the self. A macroscopic collective order emerges from the interplay of feedback, dissipation, and coherence. Although the Lindblad formalism rigorously captures microscopic quantum dynamics, the Bloch representation offers a far more tractable and intuitive description by compressing the evolution into observable quantities such as polarization, alignment, and coherence decay. Within this framework, we further identify several meaningful dynamical indicators, such as the collective order parameter, the degree of self-coherence, and the volitional inertia inferred from hysteresis-like loops, which together provide a quantitative characterization of emergent coordination and adaptation in a self-perception coupled system. Unlike traditional models of active matter that rely on instantaneous interaction rules, the introduction of an internal, slow-evolving self-subsystem integrates the history of perceptual interactions to capture adaptive and memory-dependent behavior.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance and statistical significance in complex weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most networks encountered in nature, society, and technology have weighted edges, representing the strength of the interaction/association between their vertices. Randomizing the structure of a network is a classic procedure used to estimate the statistical significance of properties of the network, such as transitivity, centrality and community structure. Randomization of weighted networks has traditionally been done via the weighted configuration model (WCM), a simple extension of the configuration model, where weights are interpreted as bundles of edges. It has previously been shown that the ensemble of randomizations provided by the WCM is affected by the specific scale used to compute the weights, but the consequences for statistical significance were unclear. Here we find that statistical significance based on the WCM is scale-dependent, whereas in most cases results should be independent of the choice of the scale. More generally, we find that designing a null model that does not violate scale invariance is challenging. A two-step approach, originally introduced for network reconstruction, in which one first randomizes the structure, then the weights, with a suitable distribution, restores scale invariance, and allows us to conduct unbiased assessments of significance on weighted networks.</description>

      <title>Graph conductance, synchronization, and a new bottleneck measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a quantification of the main bottleneck to flow over a graph, the network property of conductance plays an important role in the process of synchronization of network-coupled dynamical systems. Diffusive coupling terms serve not only to exchange information between nodes within a networked system, but ultimately to dissipate the entropy of the collective dynamic state down toward that which can be associated with a single dynamic node when the synchronization manifold is stable. While the graph conductance can characterize the coupling strength that is required to maintain widespread synchronization across a majority of the nodes in such a system, it offers no guarantee for a stable synchronization manifold, which involves all nodes in the system. We define a new measure called the synchronization bottleneck of a graph, which we denote by $\Xi$; this new network property provides a quantification of the limiting bottleneck of the flow between any subset of nodes (regardless of its order) and the rest of the networked system. This quantity does control the coupling strength required for a stable synchronization manifold for a large class of dynamical systems. Solving for this quantity is combinatorial, as is the case with conductance, but heuristics based on this optimization problem can guide decentralized strategies for improving global synchronizability.</description>

      <title>Exploring Emergent Topological Properties in Socio-Economic Networks through Learning Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how individual learning behavior and structural dynamics interact is essential to modeling emergent phenomena in socioeconomic networks. While bounded rationality and network adaptation have been widely studied, the role of heterogeneous learning rates both at the agent and network levels remains under explored. This paper introduces a dual-learning framework that integrates individualized learning rates for agents and a rewiring rate for the network, reflecting real-world cognitive diversity and structural adaptability.
  Using a simulation model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma and Quantal Response Equilibrium, we analyze how variations in these learning rates affect the emergence of large-scale network structures. Results show that lower and more homogeneously distributed learning rates promote scale-free networks, while higher or more heterogeneously distributed learning rates lead to the emergence of core-periphery topologies. Key topological metrics including scale-free exponents, Estrada heterogeneity, and assortativity reveal that both the speed and variability of learning critically shape system rationality and network architecture. This work provides a unified framework for examining how individual learnability and structural adaptability drive the formation of socioeconomic networks with diverse topologies, offering new insights into adaptive behavior, systemic organization, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Structural Vulnerability Assessment in Urban Transport Networks: A Network-Wide Geometric Approach Using Gromov-Wasserstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban transportation networks are inherently vulnerable to disruptions that affect connectivity and passenger mobility. Traditional graph_theoretic metrics, such as betweenness and degree centrality, offer insights into local network structure but often fail to capture global structural distortions resulting from link failures. On the other hand, global indices, such as those based on spectral analysis of the networks graph, fail in identifying critical elements. This study proposes to quantify the structural modifications implied by the disruption of single elements in a transportation network through the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Specifically, we iteratively remove one single edge from the original network to simulate a disruptive event and then compute the Gromov-Wasserstein distance between the original network and the disrupted one. Finally, edges are ranked depending on the observed Gromov-Wasserstein distance: the higher the value of the distance, the more critical the edge is in terms. Two transportation networks from Berlin are considered in the experiments, namely Berlin Friedrichshain Center (BFC) and Berlin Tiergarten (BT). Results reveal that Gromov-Wasserstein is largely uncorrelated with edge betweenness (rho&lt;0.1), proving its ability to capture vulnerability aspects overlooked by local network measures. Moreover, Gromov-Wasserstein exhibits an almost perfect correlation (rho=0.9999) against a proxy measure of the transportation service level, that is, the increase in the maximum shortest path. As a result, the Gromov-Wasserstein distance can be used to rank edges depending on their criticality with respect to their individual impact on the overall infrastructure and level, allowing for prioritizing maintenance, emergency planning, and enhancing the resilience of the urban transport network.</description>

      <title>Pair Approximation Meets Reality: Diffusion of Innovation in Organizational Networks within the biased-independence q-Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective adaptation, whether in innovation adoption, pro-environmental or organizational change, emerges from the interplay between individual decisions and social influence. Agent-based modeling provides a useful tool for studying such processes. Here, we introduce the biased-independence $q$-voter model, a generalization of the $q$-voter model with independence, one of the most popular agent-based models of opinion dynamics. In our model, individuals choose between two options, adopt or not adopt, under the competing influences of conformity and independent choice. Independent choice between two options is determined by an engagement parameter, inspired by earlier agent-based model of eco-innovation diffusion. When the engagement parameter equals $0.5$, the model reduces to the original $q$-voter model with independence; values different from $0.5$ break the symmetry between the two options. To place our study in a broader context, we briefly review asymmetric versions of the $q$-voter model proposed to date. The novelty of this work goes beyond introducing a generalized model: we develop the pair approximation (PA) for an asymmetric $q$-voter model and, for the first time, validate it on empirical organizational networks. Our results show that the interplay of social influence, independence, and option preference generates discontinuous phase transitions and irreversible hysteresis, reflecting path-dependent adoption dynamics. Surprisingly, the PA agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations on some empirical networks, even small ones, highlighting its potential as a computationally efficient bridge between individual decision-making and collective actions.</description>

      <title>Structurally balanced growing network as randomized P\'olya urn process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a process of growth of a signed network that strictly adheres to Heider structural balance rules, resulting in two opposing, growing factions. New agents make contact with a random existing agent and join one of the factions with bias $p$ towards the group they made contact with. The evolution of the group sizes can be mapped to a randomized P\'olya urn model. Aside from $p=1$, the relative sizes of the two factions always tend towards $1/2$, but the behavior differs in the anti-bias regime of $p&lt;1/2$ and the biased regime of $p&gt;1/2$. In the first regime, the expected faction sizes converge toward equality, regardless of initial differences, while in the latter one, initial size difference persists over time. This difference is obscured by fluctuations, with the faction size distribution remaining unimodal even above $p&gt;1/2$, up until a characteristic point $p^{ch}$, where it becomes bimodal, with initially larger and smaller factions featuring their own distinguishable peaks. We discuss several approaches to estimate this characteristic value. At $p=1$, the relative sizes of factions can persist indefinitely, although still subject to fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Global Streams, Local Currents: A Data Analysis on Global VOD Content Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores global video on demand content consumption patterns through a network-based approach. We used Netflix's 'TV-shows' ranking data, spanning 822 days across 71 countries, to construct a network where countries are represented as nodes and consumption similarities are reflected as link weights. By applying the Louvain algorithm, we identified three distinct consumption groups, 'North America and Pan-Europe', 'Asia and Middle East', and 'Central and South America group'. These groups align closely with geographic, historical, and linguistic divisions, despite no predefined grouping criteria. Notably, Turkiye, often considered a cultural and regional crossroads, exhibited some classification ambiguity but was ultimately grouped with Asia and Middle East. Our findings also show that the United States accounts for the largest share of content consumption across all groups, while South Korean content, particularly after the success of "Squid Game" in 2021, has gained and maintained popularity in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. This study, based on data, demonstrates that deep-seated cultural histories continue to shape global consumption patterns, even amidst rapid changes in media platforms and content production dynamics.</description>
