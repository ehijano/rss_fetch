      <title>Ramsey Goodness of paths and unbalanced graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ is $H$-$good$ if the Ramsey number $R(G,H)$ equals the trivial lower bound $(|G| - 1)(\chi(H) - 1) + \sigma(H)$, where $\chi(H)$ denotes the usual chromatic number of $H$, and $\sigma(H)$ denotes the minimum size of a color class in a $\chi(H)$-coloring of $H$. Pokrovskiy and Sudakov [Ramsey goodness of paths. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 122:384-390, 2017.] proved that $P_n$ is $H$-good whenever $n\geq 4|H|$. In this paper, given $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we show that if $H$ satisfy a special unbalance condition, then $P_n$ is $H$-good whenever $n \geq (2 + \varepsilon)|H|$. More specifically, we show that if $m_1,\ldots, m_k$ are such that $\varepsilon\cdot m_i \geq 2m_{i-1}^2$ for $2\leq i\leq k$, and $n \geq (2 + \varepsilon)(m_1 + \cdots + m_k)$, then $P_n$ is $K_{m_1,\ldots,m_k}$-good.</description>

      <title>$c$-functions and Koornwinder polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the theory of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials in parallel analogy with the work done for the $GL_n$ case in [CR22]. In the context of the type $CC_n$ affine root system the Macdonald polynomials of other root systems of classical type are specializations of the Koornwinder polynomials. We derive $c$-function formulas for symmetrizers and use them to give $E$-expansions, principal specializations and norm formulas for bosonic, mesonic and fermionic Koornwinder polynomials. Finally, we explain the proof of the norm conjectures and constant term conjectures for the Koornwinder case.</description>

      <title>Counting independent sets in regular graphs with bounded independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex, $d$-regular graph can have at most $2^{n/2+o_d(n)}$ independent sets. In this paper we address what happens with this upper bound when we impose the further condition that the graph has independence number at most $\alpha$.
  We give upper and lower bounds that in many cases are close to each other. In particular, for each $0 &lt; c_{\rm ind} \leq 1/2$ we exhibit a constant $k(c_{\rm ind})$ such that if $(G_n)_{n \in {\mathbb N}}$ is a sequence of graphs with $G_n$ $d$-regular on $n$ vertices and with maximum independent set size at most $\alpha$, with $d\rightarrow \infty$ and $\alpha/n \rightarrow c_{\rm ind}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, then $G_n$ has at most $k(c_{\rm ind})^{n+o(n)}$ independent sets, and we show that there is a sequence $(G_n)_{n \in {\mathbb N}}$ of graphs with $G_n$ $d$-regular on $n$ vertices ($d \leq n/2$) and with maximum independent set size at most $\alpha$, with $\alpha/n \rightarrow c_{\rm ind}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and with $G_n$ having at least $k(c_{\rm ind})^{n+o(n)}$ independent sets. We also consider the regime $1/2 &lt; c_{\rm ind} &lt; 1$. Here for each $0 &lt; c_{\rm deg} \leq 1-c_{\rm ind}$ we exhibit a constant $k(c_{\rm ind},c_{\rm deg})$ for which an analogous pair of statements can be proven, except that in each case we add the condition $d/n \rightarrow c_{\rm deg}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
  Our upper bounds are based on graph container arguments, while our lower bounds are constructive.</description>

      <title>$s$-almost $t$-intersecting families for sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of $k$-subsets of an $n$-set. Write $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(H;t)=\left\{ F\in\mathcal{F}: \left|F\cap H\right|&lt;t\right\}$ for a set $H$. The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if $\left|\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(F;t)\right|\leq s$ for each $F\in \mathcal{F}$. In this paper, we prove that $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families with maximum size are $t$-intersecting. We also consider $s$-almost $t$-intersecting families which are not $t$-intersecting, and characterize such families with maximum size.</description>

      <title>A study on token digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a digraph $D$ of order $n$ and an integer $1 \leq k \leq n-1$, the $k$-token digraph of $D$ is the graph whose vertices are all $k$-subsets of vertices of $D$ and, given two such $k$-subsets $A$ and $B$, $(A,B)$ is an arc in the $k$-token digraph whenever $\{a\} = A \setminus B$, $\{b\} = B \setminus A$, and there is an arc $(a,b)$ in $D$. Token digraphs are a generalization of token graphs. In this paper, we study some properties of token digraphs, including strong and unilateral connectivity, kernels, girth, circumference and Eulerianity. We also extend some known results on the clique and chromatic numbers of $k$-token graphs, addressing the bidirected clique number and dichromatic number of $k$-token digraphs. Additionally, we prove that determining whether $2$-token digraphs have a kernel is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>On the nonexistence of almost Moore digraphs with self-repeats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An almost Moore digraph is a diregular digraph of degree $d&gt;1$, diameter $k&gt;1$ and order $d+d^2+ \cdots +d^k$.
  Their existence has only been shown for $k=2$. It has also been conjectured that there are no more almost Moore digraphs, but so far their nonexistence has only been proven for $k=3,4$ and for $d=2,3$ when $k\geq 3$.
  In this paper we study the structure of the subdigraphs of an almost Moore digraph induced by the vertices fixed by an automorphism determined by a power of the permutation $r$ of repeats of the digraph. We deduce that each almost Moore digraph of degree $d$ and diameter $k$ with self-repeats has such a subdigraph whose vertices have order $\leq d-1$ under $r$. From this, we extend the results about the nonexistence of almost Moore digraphs with self-repeats of degrees 4 and 5 to those whose diameter is large enough with respect to the degree. More precisely, we prove their nonexistence when $k\geq 2(d-1)$ if $k$ is odd and when $k \geq 2(d-1)^2$ if $k$ is even. We also show that these findings jointly with other results imply that there are no almost Moore digraphs with self-repeats for degrees $d$, $6\leq d\leq 12$, and $k&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Product Structure and Tree-Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the structure of graphs defined by an excluded minor or an excluded odd minor through the lens of graph products and tree-decompositions. We prove that every graph excluding a fixed odd minor is contained in the strong product of two graphs each with bounded treewidth. For graphs excluding a fixed minor, we strengthen the result by showing that every such graph is contained in the strong product of two digraphs with bounded indegree and with bounded treewidth. This result has the advantage that the product now has bounded degeneracy.
  In the setting of 3-term products, we show that every $K_t$-minor-free graph is contained in $H_1\boxtimes H_2 \boxtimes K_{c(t)}$ where $\text{tw}(H_i)\leq t-2$. This treewidth bound is close to tight: in any such result with $\text{tw}(H_i)$ bounded, both $H_1$ and $H_2$ can be forced to contain any graph of treewidth $t-5$, implying $\text{tw}(H_1)\geq t-5$ and $\text{tw}(H_2)\geq t-5$. Analogous lower and upper bounds are shown for any excluded minor, where the minimum possible bound on $\text{tw}(H_i)$ is tied to the treedepth of the excluded minor.
  Subgraphs of the product of two graphs with bounded treewidth have two tree-decompositions where any bag from the first decomposition intersects any bag from the second decomposition in a bounded number, $k$, of vertices, so called $k$-orthogonal tree-decompositions. We show that graphs excluding a fixed odd-minor have a tree-decomposition and a path-decomposition that are $O(1)$-orthogonal. This implies that such graphs have a tree-decomposition in which each bag has bounded pathwidth. This result is best possible in that `pathwidth' cannot be replaced by `bandwidth' or `treedepth'. Moreover, we characterize the minor-closed classes that have a tree-decomposition in which each bag has bounded bandwidth, or each bag has bounded treedepth.</description>

      <title>Centralizers in the plactic monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let u be a word over the positive integers. Motivated in part by a question from representation theory, we study the centralizer set of u which is C(u) = {w | uw is Knuth-equivalent to wu}. In particular, we give various necessary conditions for w to be in C(u). We also characterize C(u) when u has few letters, when it has a single repeated entry, or when it is a certain type of decreasing sequence. We consider c_{n,m}(u), the number of w in C(u) of length n with max w at most m. We prove that for |u| = 1 the value of this function depends only on the relative sizes of u and m and not on their actual values. And for various u we use Stanley's theory of poset partitions to show that, for fixed n, c_{n,m}(u) is a polynomial in m with certain degree and leading coefficient. We end with various conjectures and directions for further research.</description>

      <title>Upper bound for the number of maximal dissociation sets in trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph. A dissociation set of $G$ is defined as a set of vertices that induces a subgraph in which every vertex has a degree of at most 1. A dissociation set is maximal if it is not contained as a proper subset in any other dissociation set. We introduce the notation $\Phi(G)$ to represent the number of maximal dissociation sets in $G$. This study focuses on trees, specifically showing that for any tree $T$ of order $n\geq4$, the following inequality holds: 
  \[\Phi(T)\leq 3^{\frac{n-1}{3}}+\frac{n-1}{3}.\] 
We also identify the extremal tree that attains this upper bound. Additionally, to establish the upper bound on the number of maximal dissociation sets in trees of order $n$, we also determine the second largest number of maximal dissociation sets in forests of order $n$.</description>

      <title>On hypercube statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d \geq 1$ and $s \leq 2^d$ be nonnegative integers. For a subset $A$ of vertices of the hypercube $Q_n$ and $n\geq d$, let $\lambda(n,d,s,A)$ denote the fraction of subcubes $Q_d$ of $Q_n$ that contain exactly $s$ vertices of $A$. Let $\lambda(n,d,s)$ denote the maximum possible value of $\lambda(n,d,s,A)$ as $A$ ranges over all subsets of vertices of $Q_n$, and let $\lambda(d,s)$ denote the limit of this quantity as $n$ tends to infinity. We prove several lower and upper bounds on $\lambda(d,s)$, showing that for all admissible values of $d$ and $s$ it is larger than $0.28$. We also show that the values of $s=s(d)$ such that $\lambda(d,s)=1$ are exactly $\{0,2^{d-1},2^d\}$. In addition we prove that if $0&lt;s&lt; d/8$, then $\lambda(d, s) \leq 1 - \Omega(1/s)$, and that if $s$ is divisible by a power of $2$ which is $\Omega(s)$ then $\lambda(d,s) \geq 1-O(1/s)$. We suspect that $\lambda(d,1)=(1+o(1))/e$ where the $o(1)$-term tends to $0$ as $d$ tends to infinity, but this remains open, as does the problem of obtaining tight bounds for essentially all other quantities $\lambda(d,s)$.</description>

      <title>Expanding polynomials for sets with additive structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of bivariate polynomials is well-understood for sets with a linear-sized product set. In contrast, not much is known for sets with small sumset. In this work, we provide expansion bounds for polynomials of the form $f(x, y) = g(x + p(y)) + h(y)$ for sets with small sumset. In particular, we prove that when $|A|$, $|B|$, $|A + A|$, and $|B + B|$ are not too far apart, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ we have \[|f(A, B)| = \Omega\left(\frac{|A|^{256/121 - \varepsilon}|B|^{74/121 - \varepsilon}}{|A + A|^{108/121}|B + B|^{24/121}}\right).\] We show that the above bound and its variants have a variety of applications in additive combinatorics and distinct distances problems.
  Our proof technique relies on the recent proximity approach of Solymosi and Zahl. In particular, we show how to incorporate the size of a sumset into this approach.</description>

      <title>Planar wheel-like bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge e in a matching covered graph G is removable if G-e is matching covered; a pair {e; f} of edges of G is a removable doubleton if G-e-f is matching covered, but neither G-e nor G-f is. Removable edges and removable doubletons are called removable classes, which was introduced by Lovasz and Plummer in connection with ear decompositions of matching covered graphs. A brick is a nonbipartite matching covered graph without nontrivial tight cuts. A brick G is wheel-like if G has a vertex h, such that every removable class of G has an edge incident with h. Lucchesi and Murty conjectured that every planar wheel-like brick is an odd wheel. We present a proof of this conjecture in this paper.</description>

      <title>The multiplicity of eigenvalues of nonnegative tensors and uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hu and Ye conjectured that for a $k$-th order and $n$-dimensional tensor $\mathcal{A}$ with an eigenvalue $\lambda$ and the corresponding eigenvariety $\mathcal{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$, $$\mathrm{am}(\lambda) \ge \sum_{i=1}^\kappa \mathrm{dim}(V_i)(k-1)^{\mathrm{dim}(V_i)-1},$$ where $\mathrm{am}(\lambda)$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda$, and $V_1,\ldots,V_\kappa$ are all irreducible components of $\mathcal{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$. In this paper, we prove that if $\mathcal{A}$ is a nonnegative weakly irreducible tensor with spectral radius $\rho$, then $\mathrm{am}(\lambda) \ge |\mathbb{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})|$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\mathcal{A}$ with modulus $\rho$, where $\mathbb{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$ is the projective eigenvariety of $\mathcal{A}$ associated with $\lambda$. Consequently we confirm Hu-Ye's conjecture for the above eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and the least H-eigenvalue of a weakly irreducible $Z$-tensor. We prove the equality case in Hu-Ye's conjecture for some eigenvalues of the adjacency tensor or Laplacian tensor of several classes of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s theorem for the generalized triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20832v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem from 1974 shows that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $2n/5$ must be bipartite. Its extensions to $3$-uniform hypergraphs without the generalized triangle $F_5 = \{abc, abd, cde\}$ have been explored in several previous works such as~\cite{LMR23unif,HLZ24}, demonstrating the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that for large $n$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $(1/9-\varepsilon) n^2$ must be $3$-partite.
  We determine the optimal value for $\varepsilon$ by showing that for $n \ge 5000$, every $n$-vertex $F_5$-free $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite, thus establishing the first tight Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorem for hypergraphs. As a corollary, for all positive $n$, every $n$-vertex cancellative $3$-graph with minimum degree greater than $4n^2/45$ must be $3$-partite. This result is also optimal and considerably strengthens prior work, such as that by Bollob\'{a}s~\cite{Bol74} and Keevash--Mubayi~\cite{KM04Cancel}.</description>

      <title>The existence of biregular spanning subgraphs in bipartite graphs via spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biregular bipartite graphs have been proven to have similar edge distributions to random bipartite graphs and thus have nice pseudorandomness and expansion properties. Thus it is quite desirable to find a biregular bipartite spanning subgraph in a given bipartite graph. In fact, a theorem of Ore implies a structural characterization of such subgraphs in bipartite graphs. In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of biregular bipartite spanning subgraphs in bipartite graphs by employing spectral radius. We also study the existence of spanning trees with restricted degrees and edge-disjoint spanning trees in bipartite graphs via spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Chen-Raspaud Conjecture for k = 3 and k = 4 using Enhanced Discharging Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chen-Raspaud Conjecture posits that for every integer \( k \geq 2 \), any graph \( G \) with maximum average degree \( \mathrm{mad}(G) &lt; 2 + \frac{1}{k} \) and odd girth at least \( 2k + 1 \) admits a homomorphism to the Kneser graph \( KG_{2k+1,k} \). While this conjecture has been confirmed for \( k = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), it remains open for larger values of \( k \). In this paper, I present comprehensive and rigorous proofs confirming the conjecture for \( k = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \). By employing enhanced discharging methods, introducing new structural lemmas, and conducting a thorough analysis of the graphs in question, I not only confirm the conjecture for these cases but also strengthen the theoretical framework, laying the groundwork for potential extensions to higher values of \( k \).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize a classical result by Boris Delaunay that introduced Delaunay triangulations. In particular, we prove that for a locally finite and coarsely dense generic point set $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, every generic point of $\mathbb{R}^d$ belongs to exactly $\binom{d+k}{d}$ simplices whose vertices belong to $A$ and whose circumspheres enclose exactly $k$ points of $A$. We extend this result to the cases in which the points are weighted, and when $A$ contains only finitely many points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or in $\mathbb{S}^d$. Furthermore, we use the result to give a new geometric proof for the fact that volumes of hypersimplices are Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Three observations on the Colin de Verdi\`ere spectral graph parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this small note, we collect several observations pertaining to the famous spectral graph parameter $\mu$ introduced in 1990 by Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere. This parameter is defined as the maximum corank among certain matrices akin to weighted Laplacians; we call them CdV matrices.
  First, we answer negatively a question mentioned in passing in the influential 1996 survey on $\mu$ by van der Holst, Lov\'asz, and Schrijver concerning the Perron--Frobenious eigenvector of CdV matrices.
  Second, by definition, CdV matrices posses certain transversality property. In some cases, this property is known to be satisfied automatically. We add one such case to the list.
  Third, Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere conjectured an upper bound on $\mu(G)$ for graphs embeddable into a fixed closed surface. Following a recent computer-verified counterexample to a continuous version of the conjecture by Fortier Bourque, Gruda-Mediavilla, Petri, and Pineault [arXiv:2312.03504], we also check using computer that the analogous example shows the failure of the conjectured upper bound on $\mu(G)$ for graphs embeddable into 10-torus as well as to several other larger surfaces.</description>

      <title>Pancyclicity of almost-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-planar graph is almost-planar if either deleting or contracting any edge makes it planar. A graph with $n$ vertices is pancyclic if it contains a cycle of every length from $3$ to $n$, and it is Hamiltonian if it contains a cycle of length $n$. A Hamiltonian path is a path of length $n$ and a graph with a Hamiltonian path between every pair of vertices is called Hamiltonian-connected. In 1990, Gubser characterized the class of almost-planar graphs. This paper explores the pancyclicity of these graphs. We prove that a $3$-connected almost-planar graph is pancyclic if and only if it has a cycle of length 3. Furthermore, we prove that a 4-connected almost-planar graph is both pancyclic and Hamiltonian-connected.</description>

      <title>Jackson's inequality on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the best constant $J(n,d)$ such that Jackson's inequality \[ \inf_{\mathrm{deg}(g) \leq d} \|f - g\|_{\infty} \leq J(n,d) \, s(f), \] holds for all functions $f$ on the hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$, where $s(f)$ denotes the sensitivity of $f$. We show that the quantity $J(n, 0.499n)$ is bounded below by an absolute positive constant, independent of $n$. This complements Wagner's theorem, which establishes that $J(n,d)\leq 1 $. As a first application we show that reverse Bernstein inequality fails in the tail space $L^{1}_{\geq 0.499n}$ improving over previously known counterexamples in $L^{1}_{\geq C \log \log (n)}$. As a second application, we show that there exists a function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to [-1,1]$ whose sensitivity $s(f)$ remains constant, independent of $n$, while the approximate degree grows linearly with $n$. This result implies that the sensitivity theorem $s(f) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{deg}(f)^C)$ fails in the strongest sense for bounded real-valued functions even when $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is relaxed to the approximate degree. We also show that in the regime $d = (1 - \delta)n$, the bound \[ J(n,d) \leq C \min\{\delta, \max\{\delta^2, n^{-2/3}\}\} \] holds. Moreover, when restricted to symmetric real-valued functions, we obtain $J_{\mathrm{symmetric}}(n,d) \leq C/d$ and the decay $1/d$ is sharp. Finally, we present results for a subspace approximation problem: we show that there exists a subspace $E$ of dimension $2^{n-1}$ such that $\inf_{g \in E} \|f - g\|_{\infty} \leq s(f)/n$ holds for all $f$.</description>

      <title>Characterization of $n$-Dimensional Toric and Burst-Error-Correcting Quantum Codes from Lattice Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for the development of any scalable quantum computer. In this work we introduce a generalization of a quantum interleaving method for combating clusters of errors in toric quantum error-correcting codes. We present new $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes, where $n\geq 5$, which are featured by lattice codes and apply the proposed quantum interleaving method to such new $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes. Through the application of this method to these novel $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes we derive new $n$-dimensional quantum burst-error-correcting codes. Consequently, $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes and burst-error-correcting quantum codes are provided offering both a good code rate and a significant coding gain when it comes to toric quantum codes. Another important consequence from the presented $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes is that if the Golomb and Welch conjecture in \cite{perfcodes} regarding the Lee sphere in $n$ dimensions for the respective close packings holds true, then it follows that these $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes are the only possible ones to be obtained from lattice codes. Moreover, such a methodology can be applied for burst error correction in cases involving localized errors, quantum data storage and quantum channels with memory.</description>

      <title>Simulating NMR Spectra with a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The procedure for simulating the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum linked to the spin system of a molecule for a certain nucleus entails diagonalizing the associated Hamiltonian matrix. As the dimensions of said matrix grow exponentially with respect to the spin system's atom count, the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors marks the performance of the overall process. The aim of this paper is to provide a formalization of the complete procedure of the simulation of a spin system's NMR spectrum while also explaining how to diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix with a quantum computer, thus enhancing the overall process's performance. Two well-known quantum algorithms for calculating the eigenvalues of a matrix are analyzed and put to the test in this context: quantum phase estimation and the variational quantum eigensolver. Additionally, we present simulated results for the later approach while also addressing the hypothetical noise found in a physical quantum computer.</description>

      <title>On the longest increasing subsequence and number of cycles of butterfly permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a square matrix $A$, Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) results in the factorization $PA = LU$ where $L$ and $U$ are lower and upper triangular matrices and $P$ is a permutation matrix. If $A$ is a random matrix, then the associated permutation from the $P$ factor is random. We are interested in studying properties of random permutations generated using GEPP. We introduce and present probabilistic results for groups of simple and nonsimple butterfly permutations of order $N = p^n$ for prime $p$, on which GEPP induces the Haar measure when applied to particular ensembles of random butterfly matrices. Of note, the nonsimple butterfly permutations include specific $p$-Sylow subgroups of $S_{p^n}$ for each prime $p$. Moreover, we focus on addressing the questions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the number of cycles for butterfly permutations. Our proof techniques utilize the explicit structural recursive properties of these permutations to answer what are traditionally hard analytical questions using simpler tools. For simple butterfly permutations, we provide full distributional descriptions and Law of Large Numbers (LLN) or Central Limit Theorem (CLT) type results for each statistic. For nonsimple $p$-nary butterfly permutations, we establish lower and upper power law bounds on the expected LIS of the form $N^{\alpha_p}$ and $N^{\beta_p}$ where $\frac12 &lt; \alpha_p &lt; \beta_p &lt; 1$ for each $p$ with $\alpha_p = 1 - o_p(1)$. Additionally, we determine the aysmptotic form for the number of cycles scaled by $(2 - \frac1p)^n$ that limit to new distributions we introduce depending only on $p$ whose positive integer moments satisfy explicit recursion formulas for each $p$; in particular, this characterizes a full CLT result for the number of cycles for any uniform $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_{p^n}$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a weaker version of a conjecture proposed by Qiao, Park and Koolen on diameter bounds of amply regular graphs and make new progress on Terwilliger's conjecture on finiteness of amply regular graphs. We achieve these results by a significantly improved Lin--Lu--Yau curvature estimate and new Bakry--\'Emery curvature estimates. We further discuss applications of our curvature estimates to bounding eigenvalues, isoperimetric constants, and volume growth. In particular, we obtain a volume estimate of amply regular graphs which is sharp for hypercubes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1802.05470v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove some Schur positivity results for the chromatic symmetric function $X_G$ of a (hyper)graph $G$, using connections to the group algebra of the symmetric group. The first such connection works for (hyper)forests $F$: we describe the Schur coefficients of $X_F$ in terms of eigenvalues of a product of Hermitian idempotents in the group algebra, one factor for each edge (a more general formula of similar shape holds for all chordal graphs). Our main application of this technique is to prove a conjecture of Taylor on the Schur positivity of certain $X_F$, which implies Schur positivity of the formal group laws associated to various combinatorial generating functions. We also introduce the pointed chromatic symmetric function $X_{G,v}$ associated to a rooted graph $(G,v)$. We prove that if $X_{G,v}$ and $X_{H,w}$ are positive in the generalized Schur basis of Strahov, then the chromatic symmetric function of the wedge sum of $(G,v)$ and $(H,w)$ is Schur positive.</description>

This enables us to prove new results: the non-draw property of the generalized Y game, the theorem about triangulation of the product of two simplices, multilabeled Ky Fan' s lemma, and give new proofs of known results: the multilabeled version of Sperner's lemma and generalized Atanassov conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.14925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An empty simplex is a lattice simplex in which vertices are the only lattice points. We show two constructions leading to the first known empty simplices of width larger than their dimension:
  - We introduce cyclotomic simplices and exhaustively compute all the cyclotomic simplices of dimension $10$ and volume up to $2^{31}$. Among them we find five empty ones of width $11$, and none of larger width.
  - Using circulant matrices of a very specific form, we construct empty simplices of arbitrary dimension $d$ and width growing asymptotically as $d/\operatorname{arcsinh}(1) \sim 1.1346\,d$.</description>

      <title>Crowns as retracts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09588v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate crowns as retracts of finite posets. We define a multigraph $\mathfrak{F}(P)$ reflecting the network of so-called improper 4-crowns contained in the extremal points of $P$, and we show that $P$ contains a 4-crown as retract iff there exists a graph homomorphism of a certain type from $\mathfrak{F}(P)$ to a multigraph $\mathfrak{C}$ not depending on $P$. Additionally we show that $P$ contains a retract-crown with more than four points iff the poset induced by the extremal points of $P$ contains such a retract-crown. As practical result we develop and apply criteria for the systematic investigation of crowns as retracts. Most of our results are valid for infinite posets without infinite chains, too.</description>

      <title>Colored vertex models and $k$-tilings of the Aztec diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $k$-tilings ($k$-tuples of domino tilings) of the Aztec diamond of rank $m$. We assign a weight to each $k$-tiling, depending on the number of dominos of certain types and the number of "interactions" between the tilings. Employing the colored vertex models introduced in earlier work to study supersymmetric LLT polynomials, we compute the generating polynomials of the $k$-tilings. We then prove some combinatorial results about $k$-tilings, including a bijection between $k$-tilings with no interactions and $1$-tilings, and we compute the arctic curves of the tilings for $t=0$ and $t\rightarrow\infty$. We also present some lozenge $k$-tilings of the hexagon and compute the arctic curves of the tilings for $t=0$.</description>

      <title>Realizations of multiassociahedra via rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Delta_k(n)$ denote the simplicial complex of $(k+1)$-crossing-free subsets of edges in $\binom{[n]}{2}$. Here $k,n\in \mathbb N$ and $n\ge 2k+1$.
  Jonsson (2003) proved that (neglecting the short edges that cannot be part of any $(k+1)$-crossing), $\Delta_k(n)$ is a shellable sphere of dimension $k(n-2k-1)-1$, and conjectured it to be polytopal. The same result and question arose in the work of Knutson and Miller (2004) on subword complexes.
  Despite considerable effort, the only values of $(k,n)$ for which the conjecture is known to hold are $n\le 2k+3$ (Pilaud and Santos, 2012) and $(2,8)$ (Bokowski and Pilaud, 2009).
  Using ideas from rigidity theory and choosing points along the moment curve we realize $\Delta_k(n)$ as a polytope for $(k,n)\in \{(2,9), (2,10) , (3,10)\}$. We also realize it as a simplicial fan for all $n\le 13$ and arbitrary $k$, except the pairs $(3,12)$ and $(3,13)$.
  Finally, we also show that for $k\ge 3$ and $n\ge 2k+6$ no choice of points can realize $\Delta_k(n)$ via bar-and-joint rigidity with points along the moment curve or, more generally, via cofactor rigidity with arbitrary points in convex position.</description>

Abstract: Lettericity measures the minimum size of an alphabet needed to represent a graph as a letter graph, where vertices are encoded by letters, and edges are determined by an underlying decoder. We prove that all graphs on~$n$ vertices have lettericity at most approximately $n - \tfrac{1}{2} \log_2 n$ and that almost all graphs on $n$ vertices have lettericity at least $n - (2 \log_2 n + 2 \log_2 \log_2 n)$.</description>

      <title>Laplacian $\{-1,0,1\}$- and $\{-1,1\}$-diagonalizable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph is called "Laplacian integral" if the eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix are all integers. We investigate the subset of these graphs whose Laplacian is furthermore diagonalized by a matrix with entries coming from a fixed set, in particular, the sets $\{-1,0,1\}$ or $\{-1,1\}$. Such graphs include as special cases the recently-investigated families of "Hadamard-diagonalizable" and "weakly Hadamard-diagonalizable" graphs. As a combinatorial tool to aid in our investigation, we introduce a family of vectors that we call "balanced", which generalizes totally balanced partitions, regular sequences, and complete partitions. We show that balanced vectors completely characterize which graph complements and complete multipartite graphs are $\{-1,0,1\}$-diagonalizable, and we furthermore prove results on diagonalizability of the Cartesian product, disjoint union, and join of graphs. Particular attention is paid to the $\{-1,0,1\}$- and $\{-1,1\}$-diagonalizability of the complete graphs and complete multipartite graphs. Finally, we provide a complete list of all simple, connected graphs on nine or fewer vertices that are $\{-1,0,1\}$- or $\{-1,1\}$-diagonalizable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion of a graph $F$, denoted by $F^3$, is the $3$-graph obtained from $F$ by adding a new vertex to each edge such that different edges receive different vertices. For large $n$, we establish tight upper bounds for:
  The maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $3$-graph that does not contain $T^3$ for certain class $\mathcal{T}$ of trees, sharpening (partially) a result of Kostochka--Mubayi--Verstra\"{e}te.
  The minimum number of colors needed to color the complete $n$-vertex $3$-graph to ensure the existence of a rainbow copy of $F^3$ when $F$ is a graph obtained from some tree $T\in \mathcal{T}$ by adding a new edge, extending anti-Ramsey results on $P_{2t}^3$ by Gu--Li--Shi and $C_{2t}^3$ by Tang--Li--Yan.
  The maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $3$-graph whose shadow does not contain the shadow of $C_{k}^3$ or $T^3$ for $T\in \mathcal{T}$, answering a question of Lv \etal on generalized Tur\'{a}n problems.</description>

      <title>The Rainbow Connection Number of The Commuting Graph of a Finite Nonabelian Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path in an edge-colored graph is called a rainbow path if every two distinct edges of the path have different colors. A graph whose every pair of vertices are linked by a rainbow path is called a rainbow-connected graph. The rainbow connection number of a graph is the minimum number of colors that are needed to color the edges of the graph such that the graph is rainbow-connected. In this paper, we determine the rainbow connection number of the commuting graph of a finite nonabelian group, which is a graph whose vertex set is a nonabelian group of finite order and two distinct elements of the group is adjacent in the graph if they commute. We also show that the rainbow connection number of the commuting graph of a finite group is related to the number of maximal abelian subgroups or the number of involutions that do not commute with any other nonidentity element of the group.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the class of linearly shellable pure simplicial complexes. The characterizing property is the existence of a labeling of their vertices such that all linear extensions of the Bruhat order on the set of facets are shelling orders. Coxeter complexes of weak intervals and lower Bruhat intervals of parabolic right quotients, as type-selected Coxeter complexes of lower Bruhat intervals of parabolic left quotients, are proved to be linearly shellable. We also introduce the notion of linear strong shellability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $\Delta$ is a pure simplicial complex on $n$ vertices having dimension $d$ and let $c = n-d-1$ be its codimension in the simplex. Terai and Yoshida proved that if the number of facets of $\Delta$ is at least $\binom{n}{c}-2c+1$, then $\Delta$ is Cohen-Macaulay. We improve this result by showing that these hypotheses imply the stronger condition that $\Delta$ is vertex decomposable. We give examples to show that this bound is optimal, and that the conclusion cannot be strengthened to the class of matroids or shifted complexes. We explore an application to Simon's Conjecture and discuss connections to other results from the literature.</description>

      <title>General position sets, colinear sets, and Sierpi\'{n}ski product graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G \otimes _f H$ denote the Sierpi\'nski product of graphs $G$ and $H$ with respect to the function $f$. The Sierpi\'nski general position number ${\rm gp}{_{\rm S}}(G,H)$ is introduced as the cardinality of a largest general position set in $G \otimes _f H$ over all possible functions $f$. Similarly, the lower Sierpi\'nski general position number $\underline{{\rm gp}}{_{\rm S}}(G,H)$ is the corresponding smallest cardinality. The concept of vertex-colinear sets is introduced. Bounds for the general position number in terms of extremal vertex-colinear sets, and bounds for the (lower) Sierpi\'nski general position number are proved. The extremal graphs are investigated. Formulas for the (lower) Sierpi\'nski general position number of the \SP{s} with $K_2$ as the first factor are deduced. It is proved that if $m,n\geq 2$, then ${\rm gp}{_{\rm S}}(K_m,K_n) = m(n-1)$ and that if $n\ge 2m-2$, then $\underline{{\rm gp}}{_{\rm S}}(K_m,K_n) = m(n-m+1)$.</description>

      <title>Constructions, bounds, and algorithms for peaceable queens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peaceable queens problem asks to determine the maximum number $a(n)$ such that there is a placement of $a(n)$ white queens and $a(n)$ black queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that $a(n) \leq 0.1716n^2$, for all sufficiently large $n$. This improves on the bound $a(n) \leq 0.25n^2$ of van Bommel and MacEachern.
  For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most $100$ variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software.
  We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-called Ainley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.</description>

Abstract: We give combinatorial interpretations of two residual cranks of overpartitions defined by Bringmann, Lovejoy and Osburn in 2009 analogous to the crank of partitions given by Andrews and the first author in 1988. As a consequence, we give new versions of their definitions without adjusted weights. Furthermore, we investigate the combinatorial interpretation of an $M_2$-crank of partitions without repeated odd parts and explore connections of these statistics with their companion rank counterparts and the tenth order mock theta functions of Ramanujan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a lattice in n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the chromatic number of its Voronoi graph. The Voronoi graph is the Cayley graph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this paper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To achieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension 4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi graphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley graphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from choosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs. Matching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the chromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ shatters a set $A \subseteq [n]$ if for every $A' \subseteq A$ there is an $F \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $F \cap A=A'$. We develop a framework to analyze $f(n,k,d)$, the maximum possible number of subsets of $[n]$ of size $d$ that can be shattered by a family of size $k$. Among other results, we determine $f(n,k,d)$ exactly for $d \leq 2$ and show that if $d$ and $n$ grow, with both $d$ and $n-d$ tending to infinity, then, for any $k$ satisfying $2^d \leq k \leq (1+o(1))2^d$, we have $f(n,k,d)=(1+o(1))c\binom{n}{d}$, where $c$, roughly $0.289$, is the probability that a large square matrix over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is invertible. This latter result extends work of Das and M\'esz\'aros. As an application, we improve bounds for the existence of covering arrays for certain alphabet sizes.</description>

Abstract: The Wiener index of a graph is the sum of all the distances between any pair of vertices. We aim to describe graphs which minimize the Wiener index among all unicyclic graphs with fixed girth and given degree sequence. Depending on where the centroid of the graph is, we will present three candidates for the minimization, namely the greedy unicyclic graph, the cycle-centered graph and the out-greedy unicyclic graph.</description>

      <title>Graphs with nonnegative resistance curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Palindromic length of infinite aperiodic words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The palindromic length of the finite word $v$ is equal to the minimal number of palindromes whose concatenation is equal to $v$. It was conjectured in 2013 that for every infinite aperiodic word $x$, the palindromic length of its factors is not bounded. We prove this conjecture to be true.</description>

      <title>On monochromatic solutions to linear equations over the integers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the number of monochromatic solutions to linear equations in a $2$-coloring of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We show that any nontrivial linear equation has a constant fraction of solutions that are monochromatic in any $2$-coloring of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We further study commonness of four-term equations and disprove a conjecture of Costello and Elvin by showing that, unlike over $\mathbb{F}_p$, the four-term equation $x_1 + 2x_2 - x_3 - 2x_4 = 0$ is uncommon over $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.</description>

      <title>Matching stability for 3-partite 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n,k,s$ be three integers such that $k\geq 2$ and $n\geq s\geq 1$. Let $H$ be a $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices in each class. Aharoni (2017) showed that if $e(H)&gt;(s-1)n^{k-1}$, then $H$ has a matching of size $s$.
  In this paper, we give a stability result for 3-partite 3-uniform hypergraphs: if $G$ is a $3$-partite $3$-uniform hypergraph with $n\geq 162$ vertices in each class, $e(G)\geq (s-1)n^2+3n-s$ and $G$ contains no matching of size $s+1$, then $G$ has a vertex cover of size $s$. Our bound is also tight.</description>

      <title>Fan distributions via Tverberg partitions and Gale duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equipartition theory, beginning with the classical ham sandwich theorem, seeks the fair division of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by the full-dimensional regions determined by a prescribed geometric dissection of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Here we examine $\textit{equidistributions}$ of finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by prescribed $\textit{low dimensional}$ subsets. Our main result states that if $r\geq 3$ is a prime power, then for any $m$-coloring of a sufficiently small point set $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists an $r$-fan in $\mathbb{R}^d$ -- that is, the union of $r$ ``half-flats'' of codimension $r-2$ centered about a common $(r-1)$-codimensional affine subspace -- which captures all the points of $X$ in such a way that each half-flat contains at most an $r$-th of the points from each color class. The number of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ we require for this is essentially tight when $m\geq 2$. Additionally, we extend our equidistribution results to ''piercing'' distributions in a similar fashion to Dolnikov's hyperplane transversal generalization of the ham sandwich theorem. By analogy with recent work of Frick et al., our results are obtained by applying Gale duality to linear cases of topological Tverberg-type theorems. Finally, we extend our distribution results to multiple $r$-fans after establishing a multiple intersection version of a topological Tverberg-type theorem due to Sarkaria.</description>

      <title>Counting sparse induced subgraphs in locally dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is locally dense if every induced subgraph of size larger than $\zeta n$ has density at least $d &gt; 0$, for some parameters $\zeta, d &gt; 0$. We show that the number of induced subgraphs of $G$ with $m$ vertices and maximum degree significantly smaller than $dm$ is roughly $\binom{\zeta n}{m}$, for $m \ll \zeta n$ which is not too small. This generalises a result of Kohayakawa, Lee, R\"odl, and Samotij on the number of independent sets in locally dense graphs. As an application, we slightly improve a result of Balogh, Chen, and Luo on the generalised Erd\H{o}s-Rogers function for graphs with small extremal number.</description>

      <title>Extended Weyl groups, Hurwitz transitivity and weighted projective lines I: Generalities and the tubular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.05083v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We start the systematic study of extended Weyl groups, and continue the combinatorial description of thick subcategories in hereditary categories started by Ingalls-Thomas, Igusa-Schiffler-Thomas and Krause. We show that for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ there exists an order preserving bijection between the thick subcategories of $\mathrm{coh}(\mathbb{X})$ generated by an exceptional sequence and a subposet of the interval poset of a Coxeter transformation $c$ in the Weyl group of a simply-laced extended root system if the Hurwitz action is transitive on the reduced reflection factorizations of $c$ that generate the Weyl group. By using combinatorial and group theoretical tools we show that this assumption on the transitivity of the Hurwitz action is fulfilled for a weighted projective line $\mathbb{X}$ of tubular type.</description>

      <title>A Cut-Matching Game for Constant-Hop Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends and generalizes the well-known cut-matching game framework and provides a novel cut-strategy that produces constant-hop expanders.
  Constant-hop expanders are a significant strengthening of regular expanders with the additional guarantee that any demand can be (obliviously) routed along constant-hop flow-paths - in contrast to the $\Omega(\log n)$-hop paths in expanders.
  Cut-matching games for expanders are key tools for obtaining linear-time approximation algorithms for many hard problems, including finding (balanced or approximately-largest) sparse cuts, certifying the expansion of a graph by embedding an (explicit) expander, as well as computing expander decompositions, hierarchical cut decompositions, oblivious routings, multi-cuts, and multi-commodity flows.
  The cut-matching game of this paper is crucial in extending this versatile and powerful machinery to constant-hop and length-constrained expanders and has been already been extensively used. For example, as a key ingredient in several recent breakthroughs, including, computing constant-approximate $k$-commodity (min-cost) flows in $(m+k)^{1+\epsilon}$ time as well as the optimal constant-approximate deterministic worst-case fully-dynamic APSP-distance oracle - in all applications the constant-approximation factor directly traces to and crucially relies on the expanders from a cut-matching game guaranteeing constant-hop routing paths.</description>

Abstract: The set $S(n)$ of all elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables is a minimal generating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables, but over a finite field ${\mathbb F}_q$ the set $S(n)$ is not a minimal separating set for symmetric polynomials in general. We determined when $S(n)$ is a minimal separating set for the algebra of symmetric polynomials having the least possible number of elements.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the density of planar Sets avoiding Unit Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recently published article by G. Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the density of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper bound $&lt; 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\delta_C = 0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher lower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets with a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this density is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the density of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the densities are $&gt; \delta_C$.</description>
