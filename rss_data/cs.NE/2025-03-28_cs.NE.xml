      <title>A Theoretical Analysis of Analogy-Based Evolutionary Transfer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO) has been gaining popularity in research over the years due to its outstanding knowledge transfer ability to address various challenges in optimization. However, a pressing issue in this field is that the invention of new ETO algorithms has far outpaced the development of fundamental theories needed to clearly understand the key factors contributing to the success of these algorithms for effective generalization. In response to this challenge, this study aims to establish theoretical foundations for analogy-based ETO, specifically to support various algorithms that frequently reference a key concept known as similarity. First, we introduce analogical reasoning and link its subprocesses to three key issues in ETO. Then, we develop theories for analogy-based knowledge transfer, rooted in the principles that underlie the subprocesses. Afterwards, we present two theorems related to the performance gain of analogy-based knowledge transfer, namely unconditionally nonnegative performance gain and conditionally positive performance gain, to theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of various analogy-based ETO methods. Last but not least, we offer a novel insight into analogy-based ETO that interprets its conditional superiority over traditional evolutionary optimization through the lens of the no free lunch theorem for optimization.</description>

      <title>Residual Learning Inspired Crossover Operator and Strategy Enhancements for Evolutionary Multitasking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In evolutionary multitasking, strategies such as crossover operators and skill factor assignment are critical for effective knowledge transfer. Existing improvements to crossover operators primarily focus on low-dimensional variable combinations, such as arithmetic crossover or partially mapped crossover, which are insufficient for modeling complex high-dimensional interactions.Moreover, static or semi-dynamic crossover strategies fail to adapt to the dynamic dependencies among tasks. In addition, current Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm frameworks often rely on fixed skill factor assignment strategies, lacking flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm-Residual Learning (MFEA-RL) method based on residual learning. The method employs a Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) model to generate high-dimensional residual representations of individuals, enhancing the modeling of complex relationships within dimensions. A ResNet-based mechanism dynamically assigns skill factors to improve task adaptability, while a random mapping mechanism efficiently performs crossover operations and mitigates the risk of negative transfer. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that MFEA-RL outperforms state-of-the-art multitasking algorithms. It excels in both convergence and adaptability on standard evolutionary multitasking benchmarks, including CEC2017-MTSO and WCCI2020-MTSO. Additionally, its effectiveness is validated through a real-world application scenario.</description>

      <title>Improved Runtime Analysis of a Multi-Valued Compact Genetic Algorithm on Two Generalized OneMax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research in the runtime analysis of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) has focused on univariate EDAs for multi-valued decision variables. In particular, the runtime of the multi-valued cGA (r-cGA) and UMDA on multi-valued functions has been a significant area of study. Adak and Witt (PPSN 2024) and Hamano et al. (ECJ 2024) independently performed a first runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the r-valued OneMax function (r-OneMax). Adak and Witt also introduced a different r-valued OneMax function called G-OneMax. However, for that function, only empirical results were provided so far due to the increased complexity of its runtime analysis, since r-OneMax involves categorical values of two types only, while G-OneMax encompasses all possible values.
  In this paper, we present the first theoretical runtime analysis of the r-cGA on the G-OneMax function. We demonstrate that the runtime is O(nr^3 log^2 n log r) with high probability. Additionally, we refine the previously established runtime analysis of the r-cGA on r-OneMax, improving the previous bound to O(nr log n log r), which improves the state of the art by an asymptotic factor of log n and is tight for the binary case. Moreover, we for the first time include the case of frequency borders.</description>

      <title>Bridging Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization and GPU Acceleration via Tensorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

      <title>Combining Relevance and Magnitude for Resource-Aware DNN Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pruning neural networks, i.e., removing some of their parameters whilst retaining their accuracy, is one of the main ways to reduce the latency of a machine learning pipeline, especially in resource- and/or bandwidth-constrained scenarios. In this context, the pruning technique, i.e., how to choose the parameters to remove, is critical to the system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach, called FlexRel and predicated upon combining training-time and inference-time information, namely, parameter magnitude and relevance, in order to improve the resulting accuracy whilst saving both computational resources and bandwidth. Our performance evaluation shows that FlexRel is able to achieve higher pruning factors, saving over 35% bandwidth for typical accuracy targets.</description>

      <title>Neural Exploratory Landscape Analysis for Meta-Black-Box-Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research in Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) have shown that meta-trained neural networks can effectively guide the design of black-box optimizers, significantly reducing the need for expert tuning and delivering robust performance across complex problem distributions. Despite their success, a paradox remains: MetaBBO still rely on human-crafted Exploratory Landscape Analysis features to inform the meta-level agent about the low-level optimization progress. To address the gap, this paper proposes Neural Exploratory Landscape Analysis (NeurELA), a novel framework that dynamically profiles landscape features through a two-stage, attention-based neural network, executed in an entirely end-to-end fashion. NeurELA is pre-trained over a variety of MetaBBO algorithms using a multi-task neuroevolution strategy. Extensive experiments show that NeurELA achieves consistently superior performance when integrated into different and even unseen MetaBBO tasks and can be efficiently fine-tuned for further performance boost. This advancement marks a pivotal step in making MetaBBO algorithms more autonomous and broadly applicable. The source code of NeurELA can be accessed at https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Neur-ELA.</description>

      <title>Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents that operate autonomously benefit from lifelong learning capabilities. However, compatible training algorithms must comply with the decentralized nature of these systems, which imposes constraints on both the parameter counts and the computational resources. The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is one of these. FF relies only on feedforward operations, the same used for inference, for optimizing layer-wise objectives. This purely forward approach eliminates the need for transpose operations required in traditional backpropagation. Despite its potential, FF has failed to reach state-of-the-art performance on most standard benchmark tasks, in part due to unreliable negative data generation methods for unsupervised learning.
  In this work, we propose the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) algorithm, a competitive training method aimed at closing this performance gap. Inspired by standard self-supervised contrastive learning for vision tasks, SCFF generates positive and negative inputs applicable across various datasets. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing unsupervised local learning algorithms on several benchmark datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and Tiny ImageNet. We extend FF's application to training recurrent neural networks, expanding its utility to sequential data tasks. These findings pave the way for high-accuracy, real-time learning on resource-constrained edge devices.</description>

      <title>Pretraining with random noise for uncertainty calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is crucial for various machine learning applications, yet it remains challenging. Many models exhibit hallucinations - confident yet inaccurate responses - due to miscalibrated confidence. Here, we show that the common practice of random initialization in deep learning, often considered a standard technique, is an underlying cause of this miscalibration, leading to excessively high confidence in untrained networks. Our method, inspired by developmental neuroscience, addresses this issue by simply pretraining networks with random noise and labels, reducing overconfidence and bringing initial confidence levels closer to chance. This ensures optimal calibration, aligning confidence with accuracy during subsequent data training, without the need for additional pre- or post-processing. Pre-calibrated networks excel at identifying "unknown data," showing low confidence for out-of-distribution inputs, thereby resolving confidence miscalibration.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition Applied to Sustainability Data Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) image recognition is a powerful tool for extracting data from images, but accuracy depends on providing sufficient cues in the prompt - requiring a domain expert for specialized tasks. We introduce Cue Learning using Evolution for Accurate Recognition (CLEAR), which uses a combination of LLMs and evolutionary computation to generate and optimize cues such that recognition of specialized features in images is improved. It achieves this by auto-generating a novel domain-specific representation and then using it to optimize suitable textual cues with a genetic algorithm. We apply CLEAR to the real-world task of identifying sustainability data from interior and exterior images of buildings. We investigate the effects of using a variable-length representation compared to fixed-length and show how LLM consistency can be improved by refactoring from categorical to real-valued estimates. We show that CLEAR enables higher accuracy compared to expert human recognition and human-authored prompts in every task with error rates improved by up to two orders of magnitude and an ablation study evincing solution concision.</description>

      <title>Temporal-Guided Spiking Neural Networks for Event-Based Human Action Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</description>
