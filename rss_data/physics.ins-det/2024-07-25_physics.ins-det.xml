      <title>A Flexible Data Acquisition System Architecture for the Nab Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nab experiment will measure the electron-neutrino correlation and Fierz interference term in free neutron beta decay to test the Standard Model and probe Beyond the Standard Model Physics. Using National Instrument's PXIe-5171 Reconfigurable Oscilloscope module, we have developed a data acquisition system that is not only capable of meeting Nab's specifications, but flexible enough to be adapted in situ as the experimental environment dictates. The L1 and L2 trigger logic can be reconfigured to optimize the system for coincidence event detection at runtime through configuration files and LabVIEW controls. This system is capable of identifying L1 triggers at at least $1$ MHz, while reading out a peak signal rate of approximately $2$ GB/s. During commissioning, the system ran at a sustained readout rate of $400$ MB/s of signal data originating from roughly $6$ kHz L2 triggers, well within the peak performance of the system.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Resistance Standards by a Precision LCR Meter at Frequencies up to 2 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on two-terminal-pair and four-terminal-pair test measurements of a 10-kohm resistance standard by means of a commercial precision LCR meter at frequencies up to 2 MHz. In the case of a two-terminal-pair configuration, we demonstrate that the effect of 2.5 m long measuring cables, which are inevitable for some special applications, can be corrected in the whole frequency range up to 2 MHz with an uncertainty of 9E-6 (k = 1) relative to the dc resistance value. Furthermore, the systematic effects of the LCR meter were investigated. Though distinctly larger than the resolution of the LCR meter, these effects are accurately reproducible. As such it should be possible in the future to calibrate the LCR meter against a well-known calculable high-frequency resistance standard with an uncertainty close to the few-parts-per-million type-A uncertainty of the LCR meter.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Range of SiPMs with High Pixel Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the characteristics of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) with different pixel densities, focusing on their response across a wide dynamic range. Using an experimental setup that combines laser source and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) for accurate light intensity calibration, we evaluated SiPMs with pixel counts up to 244,719 and pixel sizes down to 6 micrometers. To complement the experimental findings, a "Toy Monte Carlo" was developed to replicate the SiPMs' reponses under different lighting conditions, incorporating essential parameters such as pixel density and photon detection efficiency. The simulations aligned well with the experimental results for laser light, demonstrating similar nonlinearity trends. For BGO scintillation light, the simulations, which included multi-firing effect of pixels, showed significantly higher photon counts compared to the laser simulations. Furthermore, the simulated response derived in this research offer a method to correct for SiPM saturation effect, enabling accurate measurements in high-energy events even with SiPMs having a limited number of pixels.</description>

      <title>Design of a LYSO Crystal Electromagnetic Calorimeter for DarkSHINE Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and optimization of a LYSO crystal-based electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) for the DarkSHINE experiment, which aims to search for dark photon as potential dark force mediator. The ECAL design has been meticulously evaluated through comprehensive simulations, focusing on optimizing dimensions, material choices, and placement within the detector array to enhance sensitivity in search for dark photon signatures while balancing cost and performance. The concluded ECAL design, comprising 2.5$\times$2.5$\times$4 cm$^3$ LYSO crystals arranged in a 52.5$\times$52.5$\times$44 cm$^3$ structure, ensures high energy resolution and effective energy containment. The study also explored the energy distribution across different ECAL regions and established a dynamic range for energy measurements, with a 4 GeV limit per crystal deemed sufficient. Additionally, the radiation tolerance of ECAL components was assessed, confirming the sustainability of LYSO crystals and radiation-resistant silicon sensors.</description>

      <title>Resistance standards with calculable, nearly negligible AC-DC difference at frequencies up to 2 MHz for the calibration of precision LCR meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed novel impedance standards based on thin-film surface-mount-device (SMD) resistors. Due to the small dimensions of such resistors, the quantities determining its frequency dependence are very small and can be either measured or numerically calculated. A series connection of thin-film SMD resistors allows to further improve the dc and the ac properties. The nominal resistance value of our application is 12.906 kohm but other values are just as possible. At frequencies up to 2 MHz, the calculated frequency dependence amounts to only a few parts per million of the dc value, which is about four orders of magnitude smaller than for all conventional calculable ac-dc resistors having a similar nominal dc value. To measure the frequency dependence, we use a precision LCR meter for frequencies up to 2 MHz that has a reproducibility of a few parts per million but a systematic uncertainty which is specified by the manufacturer to increase from 300 parts per million in the lower frequency range to 3000 parts per million at 2 MHz. Measurements of two very different SMD-based resistance standards allows verification of the model calculation as well as the calibration of the precision LCR meter, both with a relative uncertainty of a few parts per million in the whole frequency range. This boost in precision by two to three orders of magnitude enables new applications such as the verification of conventional calculable resistance standards, traceable calibration of high-frequency standards, and future high-frequency measurements of the quantum Hall resistance.</description>

      <title>Measurement of muon flux behind the beam dump of J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A muon-flux measurement behind the beam dump of the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility was performed with a compact muon detector that can be inserted into a vertical observing hole which was dug underground with 81 mm in diameter. The flux of the muons penetrating the beam dump was scanned vertically at intervals of 0.5 m, showing a wide distribution with a maximum at the beam level. The muon flux was consistent with the expectation from a Monte-Carlo simulation at more than 1 m away from the beam axis, which is expected to be used for signal-loss evaluation in the future KOTO II experiment for measuring rare kaon decays. The data can also be used in improving the accuracy of shielding calculations in the radiation protection.</description>

      <title>The DAMIC-M Low Background Chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DArk Matter In CCDs at Modane (DAMIC-M) experiment is designed to search for light dark matter (m$_{\chi}$&lt;10\,GeV/c$^2$) at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) in France. DAMIC-M will use skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) as a kg-scale active detector target. Its single-electron resolution will enable eV-scale energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to a range of hidden sector dark matter candidates. A DAMIC-M prototype, the Low Background Chamber (LBC), has been taking data at LSM since 2022. The LBC provides a low-background environment, which has been used to characterize skipper CCDs, study dark current, and measure radiopurity of materials planned for DAMIC-M. It also allows testing of various subsystems like readout electronics, data acquisition software, and slow control. This paper describes the technical design and performance of the LBC.</description>

      <title>Line Segment Tracking: Improving the Phase 2 CMS High Level Trigger Tracking with a Novel, Hardware-Agnostic Pattern Recognition Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged particle reconstruction is one the most computationally heavy components of the full event reconstruction of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. Looking to the future, projections for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) indicate a superlinear growth for required computing resources for single-threaded CPU algorithms that surpass the computing resources that are expected to be available. The combination of these facts creates the need for efficient and computationally performant pattern recognition algorithms that will be able to run in parallel and possibly on other hardware, such as GPUs, given that these become more and more available in LHC experiments and high-performance computing centres. Line Segment Tracking (LST) is a novel such algorithm which has been developed to be fully parallelizable and hardware agnostic. The latter is achieved through the usage of the Alpaka library. The LST algorithm has been tested with the CMS central software as an external package and has been used in the context of the CMS HL-LHC High Level Trigger (HLT). When employing LST for pattern recognition in the HLT tracking, the physics and timing performances are shown to improve with respect to the ones utilizing the current pattern recognition algorithms. The latest results on the usage of the LST algorithm within the CMS HL-LHC HLT are presented, along with prospects for further improvements of the algorithm and its CMS central software integration.</description>

      <title>Aluminum nuclear demagnetization refrigerator for powerful continuous cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many laboratories routinely cool samples to 10 mK, but relatively few can cool condensed matter below 1 mK. Easy access to the microkelvin range would propel fields such as quantum sensors and quantum materials. Such temperatures are achieved with adiabatic nuclear demagnetization. Existing nuclear demagnetization refrigerators (NDR) are ``single-shot'', and the recycling time is incompatible with some sub-mK experiments. Furthermore, a high cooling power is required to overcome the excess heat load of order nW on NDR pre-cooled by cryogen-free dilution refrigerators. We report the performance of an aluminum NDR designed for powerful cooling when part of a dual stage continuous NDR (CNDR). Its thermal resistance is minimized to maximize the cycling rate of the CNDR and consequently its cooling power. At the same time, its susceptibility to eddy current heating is minimized. A CNDR based on two of the aluminum NDR presented here would achieve a cooling power of approximately 40 nW at 560 $\mu$K less than six days after cooling from room temperature, with a small offset in electronic temperature that decreases as the time-dependent heat load decays.</description>

      <title>Novel method for in-situ drift velocity measurement in large volume TPCs: the Geometry Reference Chamber of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for low maintenance, low ambiguity in-situ drift velocity monitoring in large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). The method was developed and deployed for the 40m^3 TPC tracker system of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, which has a one meter of drift length. The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber placed next to the TPC to be monitored, downstream with respect to the particle flux. Reconstructed tracks in the TPC are matched to hits in the monitoring chamber, called the Geometry Reference Chamber (GRC). Relative differences in positions of hits in the GRC are used to estimate the drift velocity, removing the need for an accurate alignment of the TPC to the GRC. An important design requirement on the GRC was minimal added complexity to the existing system, in particular, compatibility with Front-End Electronics cards already used to read out the TPCs. Moreover, the GRC system was designed to operate both in large and small particle fluxes. The system is capable of monitoring the evolution of the drift velocity inside the TPC down to a one permil precision, with a few minutes of data collection.</description>

      <title>Cosmic muon flux attenuation methods for superconducting qubit experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</description>
