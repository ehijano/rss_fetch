      <title>Bitcoin Price Forecasting Based on Hybrid Variational Mode Decomposition and Long Short Term Memory Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model for forecasting the price of Bitcoin, as the digital currency is known to exhibit frequent fluctuations. The models used are the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. First, VMD is used to decompose the original Bitcoin price series into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Each IMF is then modeled using an LSTM network to capture temporal patterns more effectively. The individual forecasts from the IMFs are aggregated to produce the final prediction of the original Bitcoin Price Series. To determine the prediction power of the proposed hybrid model, a comparative analysis was conducted against the standard LSTM. The results confirmed that the hybrid VMD+LSTM model outperforms the standard LSTM across all the evaluation metrics, including RMSE, MAE and R2 and also provides a reliable 30-day forecast.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Classical Machine Learning in Decentralized Finance: Comparative Evidence from Multi-Asset Backtesting of Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive empirical comparison between quantum machine learning (QML) and classical machine learning (CML) approaches in Automated Market Makers (AMM) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) trading strategies through extensive backtesting on 10 models across multiple cryptocurrency assets. Our analysis encompasses classical ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression), pure quantum models (VQE Classifier, QNN, QSVM), hybrid quantum-classical models (QASA Hybrid, QASA Sequence, QuantumRWKV), and transformer models. The results demonstrate that hybrid quantum models achieve superior overall performance with 11.2\% average return and 1.42 average Sharpe ratio, while classical ML models show 9.8\% average return and 1.47 average Sharpe ratio. The QASA Sequence hybrid model achieves the highest individual return of 13.99\% with the best Sharpe ratio of 1.76, demonstrating the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches in AMM and DeFi trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Investor Sentiment and Market Movements: A Granger Causality Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stock market is heavily influenced by investor sentiment, which can drive buying or selling behavior. Sentiment analysis helps in gauging the overall sentiment of market participants towards a particular stock or the market as a whole. Positive sentiment often leads to increased buying activity and vice versa. Granger causality can be applied to ascertain whether changes in sentiment precede changes in stock prices.The study is focused on this aspect and tries to understand the relationship between close price index and sentiment score with the help of Granger causality inference. The study finds a positive response through hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Factor Analysis of Price Movements in the Philippine Stock Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate dynamics of stock markets have led to extensive research on models that are able to effectively explain their inherent complexities. This study leverages the econometrics literature to explore the dynamic factor model as an interpretable model with sufficient predictive capabilities for capturing essential market phenomena. Although the model has been extensively applied for predictive purposes, this study focuses on analyzing the extracted loadings and common factors as an alternative framework for understanding stock price dynamics. The results reveal novel insights into traditional market theories when applied to the Philippine Stock Exchange using the Kalman method and maximum likelihood estimation, with subsequent validation against the capital asset pricing model. Notably, a one-factor model extracts a common factor representing systematic or market dynamics similar to the composite index, whereas a two-factor model extracts common factors representing market trends and volatility. Furthermore, an application of the model for nowcasting the growth rates of the Philippine gross domestic product highlights the potential of the extracted common factors as viable real-time market indicators, yielding over a 34% decrease in the out-of-sample prediction error. Overall, the results underscore the value of dynamic factor analysis in gaining a deeper understanding of market price movement dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry of the Stock Market from Graph Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the discrete Ollivier-Ricci graph curvature with Ricci flow to examine the intrinsic geometry of financial markets through the empirical correlation graph of the NASDAQ 100 index. Our main result is the development of a technique to perform surgery on the neckpinch singularities that form during the Ricci flow of the empirical graph, using the behavior and the lower bound of curvature of the fully connected graph as a starting point. We construct an algorithm that uses the curvature generated by intrinsic geometric flow of the graph to detect hidden hierarchies, community behavior, and clustering in financial markets despite the underlying challenges posed by a highly connected geometry.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Attention in Betting Exchange Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the implementation of a short-term forecasting system for price movements in exchange markets, using market depth data and a systematic procedure to enable a fully automated trading system. The case study focuses on the UK to Win Horse Racing market during the pre-live stage on the world's leading betting exchange, Betfair. Innovative convolutional attention mechanisms are introduced and applied to multiple recurrent neural networks and bi-dimensional convolutional recurrent neural network layers. Additionally, a novel padding method for convolutional layers is proposed, specifically designed for multivariate time series processing. These innovations are thoroughly detailed, along with their execution process. The proposed architectures follow a standard supervised learning approach, involving model training and subsequent testing on new data, which requires extensive pre-processing and data analysis. The study also presents a complete end-to-end framework for automated feature engineering and market interactions using the developed models in production. The key finding of this research is that all proposed innovations positively impact the performance metrics of the classification task under examination, thereby advancing the current state-of-the-art in convolutional attention mechanisms and padding methods applied to multivariate time series problems.</description>

      <title>Institutional Differences, Crisis Shocks, and Volatility Structure: A By-Window EGARCH/TGARCH Analysis of ASEAN Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how institutional differences and external crises shape volatility dynamics in emerging Asian stock markets. Using daily stock index returns for Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines from 2010 to 2024, we estimate EGARCH(1,1) and TGARCH(1,1) models in a by-window design. The sample is split into the 2013 Taper Tantrum, the 2020-2021 COVID-19 period, the 2022-2023 rate-hike cycle, and tranquil phases. Prior work typically studies a single market or a static period; to our knowledge no study unifies institutional comparison with multi-crisis dynamics within one GARCH framework. We address this gap and show that all three markets display strong volatility persistence and fat-tailed returns. During crises both persistence and asymmetry increase, while tail thickness rises, implying more frequent extreme moves. After crises, parameters revert toward pre-shock levels. Cross-country evidence indicates a buffering role of institutional maturity: Malaysias stronger regulatory and information systems dampen amplification and speed recovery, whereas the Philippines thinner market structure prolongs instability. We conclude that crises amplify volatility structures, while institutional robustness governs recovery speed. The results provide policy guidance on transparency, macroprudential communication, and liquidity support to reduce volatility persistence during global shocks.</description>

      <title>Cash Flow Underwriting with Bank Transaction Data: Advancing MSME Financial Inclusion in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established or young businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. Firstly, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end to end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Thirdly, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Lastly, we intend to release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSMEs financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.</description>

      <title>Sentiment and Volatility in Financial Markets: A Review of BERT and GARCH Applications during Geopolitical Crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence techniques have increasingly been applied to understand the complex relationship between public sentiment and financial market behaviour. This study explores the relationship between the sentiment of news related to the Russia-Ukraine war and the volatility of the stock market. A comprehensive dataset of news articles from major US platforms, published between January 1 and July 17, 2024, was analysed using a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model adapted for financial language. We extracted sentiment scores and applied a Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, enhanced with a Student-t distribution to capture the heavy-tailed nature of financial returns data. The results reveal a statistically significant negative relationship between negative news sentiment and market stability, suggesting that pessimistic war coverage is associated with increased volatility in the S&amp;P 500 index. This research demonstrates how artificial intelligence and natural language processing can be integrated with econometric modelling to assess real-time market dynamics, offering valuable tools for financial risk analysis during geopolitical crises.</description>

      <title>A three-step machine learning approach to predict market bubbles with financial news</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a three-step machine learning framework to predict bubbles in the S&amp;P 500 stock market by combining financial news sentiment with macroeconomic indicators. Building on traditional econometric approaches, the proposed approach predicts bubble formation by integrating textual and quantitative data sources. In the first step, bubble periods in the S&amp;P 500 index are identified using a right-tailed unit root test, a widely recognized real-time bubble detection method. The second step extracts sentiment features from large-scale financial news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which capture investors' expectations and behavioral patterns. In the final step, ensemble learning methods are applied to predict bubble occurrences based on high sentiment-based and macroeconomic predictors. Model performance is evaluated through k-fold cross-validation and compared against benchmark machine learning algorithms. Empirical results indicate that the proposed three-step ensemble approach significantly improves predictive accuracy and robustness, providing valuable early warning insights for investors, regulators, and policymakers in mitigating systemic financial risks.</description>

      <title>Aligning Language Models with Investor and Market Behavior for Financial Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most financial recommendation systems often fail to account for key behavioral and regulatory factors, leading to advice that is misaligned with user preferences, difficult to interpret, or unlikely to be followed. We present FLARKO (Financial Language-model for Asset Recommendation with Knowledge-graph Optimization), a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to generate asset recommendations that are both profitable and behaviorally aligned. FLARKO encodes users' transaction histories and asset trends as structured KGs, providing interpretable and controllable context for the LLM. To demonstrate the adaptability of our approach, we develop and evaluate both a centralized architecture (CenFLARKO) and a federated variant (FedFLARKO). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of combining KTO for fine-tuning of LLMs for financial asset recommendation. We also present the first use of structured KGs to ground LLM reasoning over behavioral financial data in a federated learning (FL) setting. Evaluated on the FAR-Trans dataset, FLARKO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines on behavioral alignment and joint profitability, while remaining interpretable and resource-efficient.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process Using Ultra-High-Frequency Data with Application to Intraday Pairs Trading Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When stock prices are observed at high frequencies, more information can be utilized in estimation of parameters of the price process. However, high-frequency data are contaminated by the market microstructure noise which causes significant bias in parameter estimation when not taken into account. We propose an estimator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process based on the maximum likelihood which is robust to the noise and utilizes irregularly spaced data. We also show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process contaminated by the independent Gaussian white noise and observed at discrete equidistant times follows an ARMA(1,1) process. To illustrate benefits of the proposed noise-robust approach, we introduce a novel intraday pairs trading strategy based on the mean-variance optimization. In an empirical study of 7 Big Oil companies, we show that the use of the proposed estimator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leads to an increase in profitability of the pairs trading strategy.</description>
