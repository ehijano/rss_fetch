      <title>Comment on: "Dynamics of disordered quantum systems with two- and three-dimensional tensor networks" arXiv:2503.05693</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent preprint [1] (arXiv:2503.05693), Tindall et al. presented impressive classical simulations of quantum dynamics using tensor networks. Their methods represent a significant improvement in the classical state of the art, and in some cases show lower errors than recent simulations of quantum dynamics using a quantum annealer [2] (King et al., Science, eado6285, 2025). However, of the simulations in Ref. [2], Ref. [1] did not attempt the most complex lattice geometry, nor reproduce the largest simulations in 3D lattices, nor simulate the longest simulation times, nor simulate the low-precision ensembles in which correlations grow the fastest, nor produce the full-state and fourth-order observables produced by Ref. [2]. Thus this work should not be misinterpreted as having overturned the claim of Ref. [2]: the demonstration of quantum simulations beyond the reach of classical methods. Rather, these classical advances narrow the parameter space in which beyond-classical computation has been demonstrated. In the near future these classical methods can be combined with quantum simulations to help sharpen the boundary between classical and quantum simulability.</description>

      <title>A Geometric-Aware Perspective and Beyond: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric Machine Learning (GML) has shown that respecting non-Euclidean geometry in data spaces can significantly improve performance over naive Euclidean assumptions. In parallel, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm that leverages superposition, entanglement, and interference within quantum state manifolds for learning tasks. This paper offers a unifying perspective by casting QML as a specialized yet more expressive branch of GML. We argue that quantum states, whether pure or mixed, reside on curved manifolds (e.g., projective Hilbert spaces or density-operator manifolds), mirroring how covariance matrices inhabit the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices or how image sets occupy Grassmann manifolds. However, QML also benefits from purely quantum properties, such as entanglement-induced curvature, that can yield richer kernel structures and more nuanced data embeddings.
  We illustrate these ideas with published and newly discussed results, including hybrid classical -quantum pipelines for diabetic foot ulcer classification and structural health monitoring. Despite near-term hardware limitations that constrain purely quantum solutions, hybrid architectures already demonstrate tangible benefits by combining classical manifold-based feature extraction with quantum embeddings. We present a detailed mathematical treatment of the geometrical underpinnings of quantum states, emphasizing parallels to classical Riemannian geometry and manifold-based optimization. Finally, we outline open research challenges and future directions, including Quantum Large Language Models (LLMs), quantum reinforcement learning, and emerging hardware approaches, demonstrating how synergizing GML and QML principles can unlock the next generation of machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive framework to simulate real-time chemical dynamics on a fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive end-to-end framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of chemical systems on a fault-tolerant quantum computer, incorporating both electronic and nuclear quantum degrees of freedom. An all-particle simulation is nominally efficient on a quantum computer, but practically infeasible. Hence, central to our approach is the construction of a first-quantized plane-wave algorithm making use of pseudoions. The latter consolidate chemically inactive electrons and the nucleus into a single effective dynamical ionic entity, extending the well-established concept of pseudopotentials in quantum chemistry to a two-body interaction. We explicitly describe efficient quantum circuits for initial state preparation across all degrees of freedom, as well as for block-encoding the Hamiltonian describing interacting pseudoions and chemically active electrons, by leveraging recent advances in quantum rejection sampling to optimize the implementations. To extract useful chemical information, we first design molecular fingerprints by combining density-functional calculations with machine learning techniques, and subsequently validate them through surrogate classical molecular dynamics simulations. These fingerprints are then coherently encoded on a quantum computer for efficient molecular identification via amplitude estimation. We provide an extensive analysis of the cost of running the algorithm on a fault-tolerant quantum computer for several chemically interesting systems. As an illustration, simulating the interaction between $\mathrm{NH_3}$ and $\mathrm{BF_3}$ (a 40-particle system) requires 808 logical qubits to encode the problem, and approximately $10^{11}$ Toffoli gates per femtosecond of time evolution. Our results establish a foundation for further quantum algorithm development targeting chemical and material dynamics.</description>

      <title>The future of secure communications: device independence in quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving landscape of quantum cryptography, Device-independent Quantum Key Distribution (DI-QKD) stands out for its unique approach to ensuring security based not on the trustworthiness of the devices but on nonlocal correlations. Beginning with a contextual understanding of modern cryptographic security and the limitations of standard quantum key distribution methods, this review explores the pivotal role of nonclassicality and the challenges posed by various experimental loopholes for DI-QKD. Various protocols, security against individual, collective and coherent attacks, and the concept of self-testing are also examined, as well as the entropy accumulation theorem, and additional mathematical methods in formulating advanced security proofs. In addition, the burgeoning field of semi-device-independent models (measurement DI--QKD, Receiver DI--QKD, and One--sided DI--QKD) is also analyzed. The practical aspects are discussed through a detailed overview of experimental progress and the open challenges toward the commercial deployment in the future of secure communications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Covert Communication under Extreme Adversarial Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure quantum communication traditionally assumes that the adversary controls only the public channel. We consider a more powerful adversary who can demand private information of users. This type of adversary has been studied in public key cryptography in recent years, initiated by Persiano, Phan, and Yung at Eurocrypt 2022. We introduce a similar attacker to quantum communication, referring to it as the controller. The controller is a quantum computer that controls the entire communication infrastructure, including both classical and quantum channels. It can even ban classical public key cryptography and post-quantum public key cryptography, leaving only quantum cryptography and post-quantum symmetric key cryptography as the remaining options. We demonstrate how such a controller can control quantum communication and how users can achieve covert communication under its control.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Composable Security and Tight Error Correction Bound for Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained devices, such as smart sensors, wearable devices, and Internet of Things nodes, are increasingly prevalent in society and rely on secure communications to function properly. These devices often operate autonomously, exchanging sensitive data or commands over short distances, such as within a room, house, or warehouse. In this context, continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) offers the highest secure key rate and the greatest versatility for integration into existing infrastructure. A key challenge in this setting, where devices have limited storage and processing capacity, is obtaining a realistic and tight estimate of the CV-QKD secure key rate within a composable security framework, with error correction (EC) consuming most of the storage and computational power. To address this, we focus on low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with non-binary alphabets, which optimise mutual information and are particularly suited for short-distance communications. We develop a security framework to derive finite-size secret keys near the optimal EC leakage limit and model the related memory requirements for the encoding process in one-way error correction. This analysis facilitates the practical deployment of CV-QKD, particularly in constrained devices with limited storage and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Unlimited quantum correlation advantage from bound entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled states that cannot be distilled to maximal entanglement are called bound entangled and they are often viewed as too weak to break the limitations of classical models. Here, we show a strongly contrasting result: that bound entangled states, when deployed as resources between two senders who communicate with a receiver, can generate correlation advantages of unlimited magnitude. The proof is based on using many copies of a bound entangled state to assist quantum communication. We show that in order to simulate the correlations predicted by bound entanglement, one requires in the many-copy limit either an entanglement visibility that tends to zero or a diverging amount of overhead communication. This capability of bound entanglement is unlocked by only using elementary single-qubit operations. The result shows that bound entanglement can be a scalable resource for breaking the limitations of physical models without access to entanglement.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Mutation Techniques in Genetic Algorithm-Based Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing leverages the unique properties of qubits and quantum parallelism to solve problems intractable for classical systems, offering unparalleled computational potential. However, the optimization of quantum circuits remains critical, especially for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices with limited qubits and high error rates. Genetic algorithms (GAs) provide a promising approach for efficient quantum circuit synthesis by automating optimization tasks. This work examines the impact of various mutation strategies within a GA framework for quantum circuit synthesis. By analyzing how different mutations transform circuits, it identifies strategies that enhance efficiency and performance. Experiments utilized a fitness function emphasizing fidelity, while accounting for circuit depth and T operations, to optimize circuits with four to six qubits. Comprehensive hyperparameter testing revealed that combining delete and swap strategies outperformed other approaches, demonstrating their effectiveness in developing robust GA-based quantum circuit optimizers.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on depth-2 QAC-circuits computing parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the parity of more than three non-target input bits cannot be computed by QAC-circuits of depth-2, not even uncleanly, regardless of the number of ancilla qubits. This result is incomparable with other recent lower bounds on constant-depth QAC-circuits by Rosenthal [ICTS~2021,arXiv:2008.07470] and uses different techniques which may be of independent interest:
  1. We show that all members of a certain class of multivariate polynomials are irreducible. The proof applies a technique of Shpilka &amp; Volkovich [STOC 2008]. 2. We give a tight-in-some-sense characterization of when a multiqubit CZ gate creates or removes entanglement from the state it is applied to.
  The current paper strengthens an earlier version of the paper [arXiv:2005.12169].</description>

      <title>Successive randomized compression: A randomized algorithm for the compressed MPO-MPS product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks like matrix product states (MPSs) and matrix product operators (MPOs) are powerful tools for representing exponentially large states and operators, with applications in quantum many-body physics, machine learning, numerical analysis, and other areas. In these applications, computing a compressed representation of the MPO--MPS product is a fundamental computational primitive. For this operation, this paper introduces a new single-pass, randomized algorithm, called successive randomized compression (SRC), that improves on existing approaches in speed or in accuracy. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated on synthetic problems and unitary time evolution problems for quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced cooling via self-Kerr nonlinearity in cavity-magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling massive oscillators to quantum ground state is a key step for their precise control and quantum application. Recent work found that the center-of-mass motion of a levitated magnetic sphere can be cooled via magnon-cavity coupling. In this work, we demonstrate that a enhanced cooling can be realized by exploiting self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnon mode, observed in a ferrimagnetic yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere. By means of proper pump driving, the self-Kerr nonlinearity is mapped into degenerate magnon squeezing, leading to considerable enhancement of cooling via optimizing system parameters. Moreover, this Kerr nonlinear effect also brings enhanced cooling in the sideband-unresolved regime where the mechanical frequency is smaller than the cavity decay rate. These results provide new way to quantum technologies in terms of storage schemes and ultrasensitive measurements.</description>

      <title>Unified Quantum Dynamics: The Emergence of the Born Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Born rule is traditionally introduced as a separate postulate of quantum mechanics, we show it emerges naturally from a modified Schr\"odinger equation that includes "small-signal truncation". This parallels the way quantum decoherence gives rise to the branches of the multiverse in the "Many-Worlds Interpretation", eliminating the need for a separate measurement postulate. Our approach thus offers a unified framework in which both the emergence of multiple branches of the multiverse and their statistical properties follow from a single fundamental law of motion. We model "small-signal truncation" in a somewhat stylized manner, but we argue that the precise details of its underlying physical mechanism do not affect the emergence of the Born rule.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Quantum Encoding Techniques: A Comparative Study of Embedding Techniques and Their Impact on Machine Learning Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the intersection of continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) and classical machine learning, focusing on CVQC data encoding techniques, including Displacement encoding and squeezing encoding, alongside Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) encoding from discrete quantum computing. We perform an extensive empirical analysis to assess the impact of these encoding methods on classical machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and ensemble methods like Random Forest and LightGBM. Our findings indicate that CVQC-based encoding methods significantly enhance feature expressivity, resulting in improved classification accuracy and F1 scores, especially in high-dimensional and complex datasets. However, these improvements come with varying computational costs, which depend on the complexity of the encoding and the architecture of the machine learning models. Additionally, we examine the trade-off between quantum expressibility and classical learnability, offering valuable insights into the practical feasibility of incorporating these quantum encodings into real-world applications. This study contributes to the growing body of research on quantum-classical hybrid learning, emphasizing the role of CVQC in advancing quantum data representation and its integration into classical machine learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Quantum Magnetic J-Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize quantum oscillators operating at microhertz to tens of hertz frequencies based on nuclear scalar couplings in molecules in solution. The oscillators are implemented by coupling in situ hyperpolarized samples with programmable digital feedback that allows amplifying specific J-coupling transitions at zero field. Due to the fundamental insensitivity of J-couplings to magnetic field fluctuations, we achieve extremely stable coherent oscillations for longer than 3000 s, with a 337 uHz linewidth limited primarily by the measurement time. The ability to control the feedback delay and the external gain enabled us to resolve overlapping resonances, making possible on-demand spectral editing. Importantly, implementing active feedback allowed us to obviate the requirement of population inversion and relax the requirements on sample polarization. The quantum oscillator phenomenon demonstrated here for various chemical classes (nitriles, heterocycles, and organic acids) significantly improves resolution of zero-field NMR spectra, including for samples with natural isotopic abundance, and expands applications of J-spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Low-latency control system for feedback experiments with optical tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and characterize a modular, open-source system to perform feedback control experiments on configurations of atoms and molecules in arrays of optical tweezers. The system features a modular, cost-effective computer architecture with a motherboard and peripheral cards. It supports efficient data transfer to and from graphics processing units (GPUs) using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), leveraging GPU efficiency in matrix multiplication and parallelism, while enabling direct data transfer between devices without involving the CPU. We first describe the architecture and workflow of the system, detailing its hardware components and software modules. We then evaluate the computational runtime for preparing defect-free chains and grids of atoms using efficient implementations of atom reconfiguration algorithms. Finally, we discuss timing bottlenecks and strategies to reduce latency. Beyond solving reconfiguration problems, the system can readily be used to implement adaptive and feedforward protocols, as well as digital quantum algorithms relying on particle displacement. Our results lay the groundwork for developing low-latency feedback control systems, benchmarking their performance, and advancing scalable quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Experimental Implementation of a Qubit-Efficient Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Analog Error Mitigation on a Superconducting Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a qubit-efficient variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm using a superconducting quantum processor, employing minimal quantum resources with only a transmon qubit coupled to a high-coherence photonic qubit. By leveraging matrix product states to compress the quantum state representation, we simulate an N + 1-spin circular Ising model with a transverse field. Furthermore, we develop an analog error mitigation approach through zero-noise extrapolation by introducing a precise noise injection technique for the transmon qubit. As a validation, we apply our error-mitigated qubit-efficient VQE in determining the ground state energies of a 4-spin Ising model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of performing quantum algorithms with minimal quantum resources while effectively mitigating the impact of noise, offering a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theoretical advances and practical implementations on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Coherence-decoherence interplay in quantum systems due to projective stochastic pulses: The case of Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of coherence and decoherence is played out in a three-level quantum system, in which the third level is incoherently coupled to the second one which itself is in coherent interaction with the first level. The study is based on a stochastic scenario in which the coherent, unitary evolution of the system is randomly interrupted by a Poisson-driven pulse sequence. In the absence of an external pulse, the system undergoes coherent, unitary evolution restricted to the subspace spanned by the first level (level $1$) and the second level (level $2$). The application of a pulse induces transitions between the second and the third level (level $3$), thereby introducing non-unitary effects that perturb the otherwise isolated two-level dynamics. The pulses are assumed to have infinitesimal duration, with strengths modeled as random variables that are uncorrelated across different pulses. A representative model for the stochastically-averaged transition (super)operator mimicking the dynamics induced by the application of pulses allows for an analytical derivation of the matrix elements of the averaged density operator. When the system is initially in level $1$, we obtain in particular the temporal behavior of the stay-put probability, that is, the probability $P_1(t)$ that the system is still in level $1$ at time $t$. As a function of time, the quantity $P_1(t)$ exhibits a coherence-to-decoherence crossover behavior. At short times $t \ll 1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average frequency at which pulses are applied to the system, coherent dynamics dominate. Consequently, $P_1(t)$ displays pronounced Rabi-like oscillations. At long times $t \gg 1/\lambda$, decoherence effects prevail, leading to an exponential decay of the form $P_1(t) \sim \exp(-\lambda t)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of quantum states into distinct classes poses a significant challenge. In this study, we address this problem using quantum neural networks in combination with a problem-inspired circuit and customised as well as predefined ans\"{a}tz. To facilitate the resource-efficient quantum state classification, we construct the dataset of quantum states using the proposed problem-inspired circuit. The problem-inspired circuit incorporates two-qubit parameterised unitary gates of varying entangling power, which is further integrated with the ans\"{a}tz, developing an entire quantum neural network. To demonstrate the capability of the selected ans\"{a}tz, we visualise the mitigated barren plateaus. The designed quantum neural network demonstrates the efficiency in binary and multi-class classification tasks. This work establishes a foundation for the classification of multi-qubit quantum states and offers the potential for generalisation to multi-qubit pure quantum states.</description>

      <title>Are Molecules Magical? Non-Stabilizerness in Molecular Bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantum Gates of Non-closed Paths Under Counterdiabatic Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic and non-closed evolutionary paths play a significant role in the fidelity of quantum gates. We propose a high-fidelity quantum control framework based on the quasi-topological number ($\nu_{\text{qua}}$), which extends the traditional Chern number to characterize geometric responses in non-closed paths. By introducing a counterdiabatic gauge potential (AGP) that dynamically suppresses non-adiabatic transitions and reconstructs path curvature, we demonstrate that $\nu_{\text{qua}}$ -a relative homotopy invariant of compact manifolds in parameter space-quantifies the robustness of geometric phases during open-path quantum evolution. This integer invariant ensures gauge-invariant suppression of decoherence errors arising from dynamical phase coupling. By introducing nonlinear parametric ring paths, we address the defects caused by intermediate states in the Rydberg atomic system. Numerical simulations in the Kitaev superconducting chain and 2D transverse-field Ising model confirm that our protocol achieves quantum gate fidelity exceeding $\mathcal{F} &gt; 0.9999$. We bridges geometric quantum control with topological protection, offering a universal approach to noise-resistant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Kerr enhanced optomechanical entanglement via reservoir design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum technologies, enabling advancements in quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum precision measurement. Here, we propose a method to enhance optomechanical entanglement by introducing an optical Kerr nonlinear medium and a squeezed vacuum reservoir of the optomechanical cavity. By performing the displacement and squeezing transformations, the system can be reduced to a standard linearized optomechanical system with normalized driving detuning and linearized-coupling strength, in which the optical and mechanical modes are, respectively, coupled to an optical vacuum bath and a mechanical heat bath. We focus on the entanglement generation in the single stable regime of the system. By evaluating the steady-state logarithm negativity, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be enhanced within a wide range of the Kerr constant. In addition, the Kerr nonlinearity can extend the stable region, enabling considerable entanglement generation in the blue sideband-parameter region. We also investigate the dependence of the entanglement generation on the average thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath and the optical driving amplitude. It is found that the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity allows the generation of optomechanical entanglement even when the thermal phonon occupation of the mechanical bath is as high as 3000. Our findings will provide valuable insights into enhancing fragile quantum resources in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based qubit configuration optimization for variational algorithms on neutral atom quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report an algorithm that is able to tailor qubit interactions for individual variational quantum algorithm problems. Here, the algorithm leverages the unique ability of a neutral atom tweezer platform to realize arbitrary qubit position configurations. These configurations determine the degree of entanglement available to a variational quantum algorithm via the interatomic interactions. Good configurations will accelerate pulse optimization convergence and help mitigate barren plateaus. As gradient-based approaches are ineffective for position optimization due to the divergent $R^{-6}$ nature of neutral atom interactions, we opt to use a consensus-based algorithm to optimize the qubit positions. By sampling the configuration space instead of using gradient information, the consensus-based algorithm is able to successfully optimize the positions, yielding adapted variational quantum algorithm ansatzes that lead to both faster convergence and lower errors. In this work, we show that these optimized configurations generally result in large improvements in the system's ability to solve ground state minimization problems for both random Hamiltonians and small molecules.</description>

      <title>Exact QSP angles for odd monomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical solution to the angle-finding problem in quantum signal processing (QSP) for monomials of odd degree.
  Specifically, we show that to implement a monomial of degree \( n \), where \( n \) is odd, it suffices to choose powers of a primitive \( n \)-th root of unity as QSP phase angles.
  Our approach departs from standard numerical methods and is rooted in a group-theoretic argument.
  Being fully analytical, it eliminates numerical errors and reduces computational overhead in QSP implementation of odd monomials.
  Such use cases arise, for example, in quantum computing, where self-adjoint contractions are embedded into unitary operators acting on extended Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Machine Learning with Quantum Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that promises advantages such as faster training, improved reliability and superior feature extraction over classical counterparts. However, its implementation on quantum hardware is challenging due to the noise inherent in these systems, necessitating the use of quantum error correction (QEC) codes. Current QML research remains primarily theoretical, often assuming noise-free environments and offering little insight into the integration of QEC with QML implementations. To address this, we investigate the performance of a simple, parity-classifying Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) implemented with the [[4,2,2]] error-detecting stabiliser code in a simulated noisy environment, marking the first study into the implementation of a QML algorithm with a QEC code. We invoke ancilla qubits to logically encode rotation gates, and classically simulate the logically-encoded VQC under two simple noise models representing gate noise and environmental noise. We demonstrate that the stabiliser code improves the training accuracy at convergence compared to noisy implementations without QEC. However, we find that the effectiveness and reliability of error detection is contingent upon keeping the ancilla qubit error rates below a specific threshold, due to the propagation of ancilla errors to the physical qubits. Our results provide an important insight: for QML implementations with QEC codes that both require ancilla qubits for logical rotations and cannot fully correct errors propagated between ancilla and physical qubits, the maximum achievable accuracy of the QML model is limited. This highlights the need for additional error correction or mitigation strategies to support the practical implementation of QML algorithms with QEC on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A few remarks concerning application of the Lifshitz theory to calculation of the Casimir-Polder interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lifshitz theory provides a semiclassical description of the Casimir-Polder atom-plate interaction, where the electromagnetic field is quantized whereas the material of the plate is considered as a continuous medium. This places certain restrictions on its application regarding the allowable atom-plate separation distances and the dielectric properties of the plate material. Below we demonstrate that in some recent literature the application conditions of the Lifshitz theory established by its founders are violated by applying it at too short separations and using the dielectric permittivities possessing the negative imaginary parts in violation of the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) captures the variations of quantum states with parameters, serving as a central concept in modern quantum physics. Its real part, the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), has a measurement-dependent counterpart that links statistics to distinguishability. However, an analogous extension for the QGT is hindered by the fundamental inaccessibility of its imaginary part through measurement probabilities. Here we introduce a counterpart to the QGT that includes measurement operators, termed the \textit{semi-classical} geometric tensor (SCGT). We show that the SCGT provides a lower bound to the QGT that is tight for pure states. Moreover, we use the SCGT to derive sharp multiparameter information bounds and discuss extensions of the Berry phase.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and noise in strongly driven Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In circuit quantum electrodynamics systems, the quasiparticle-related losses in Josephson junctions are suppressed due to the gap in the superconducting density of states which is much higher than the typical energy of a microwave photon. In this work, we show that a strong drive even at frequency lower than the double superconducting gap enables dissipation in the junctions due to photon-assisted breaking of the Cooper pairs. Both the decay rate and noise strength associated with the losses are sensitive to the dc phase bias of the junction and can be tuned in a broad range by the amplitude and the frequency of the external driving field, making the suggested mechanism potentially attractive for designing tunable dissipative elements. Furthermore, pronounced memory effects in the driven Josephson junctions render them perspective for both theoretical and experimental study of non-Markovian physics in superconducting quantum circuits. We illustrate our theoretical findings by studying the spectral properties and the steady state population of a low impedance resonator coupled to the driven Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Equation, Mass and Arithmetic by Permutations of Automaton States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cornerstones of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics are its underlying ontological states that evolve by permutations. They do not create would-be quantum mechanical superposition states. We review this with a classical automaton consisting of an Ising spin chain which is then related to the Weyl equation in the continuum limit. Based on this and generalizing, we construct a new ``Necklace of Necklaces'' automaton with a torus-like topology that lends itself to represent the Dirac equation in 1 + 1 dimensions. Special attention has to be paid to its mass term, which necessitates this enlarged structure and a particular scattering operator contributing to the step-wise updates of the automaton. As discussed earlier, such deterministic models of discrete spins or bits unavoidably become quantum mechanical, when only slightly deformed.</description>

      <title>A Practical Cross-Platform, Multi-Algorithm Study of Quantum Optimisation for Configurational Analysis of Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers show potential for achieving computational advantage over classical computers, with many candidate applications in the domains of chemistry and materials science. We consider the well-studied problem of configurational analysis of materials and, more specifically, finding the lowest energy configuration of defective graphene structures. This problem acts as a test-case which allows us to study various algorithms that are applicable to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) problems, which are generally classically intractable exactly. To solve this problem, we implement two methods, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Annealing (QA), on commercially-available gate-based and quantum annealing devices that are accessible via Quantum-Computing-as-a-Service (QCaaS) models. To analyse the performance of these algorithms, we use a toolbox of relevant metrics and compare performance against three classical algorithms. We employ quantum methods to solve fully-connected QUBOs of up to $72$ variables, and find that algorithm performance beyond this is restricted by device connectivity, noise and classical computation time overheads. The applicability of our approach goes beyond the selected configurational analysis test-case, and we anticipate that our approach will be of use for optimisation problems in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine classical and quantum Machine Learning (ML) techniques to effectively analyze long time-series data acquired during experiments. Specifically, we demonstrate that replacing a deep classical neural network with a thoughtfully designed Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) in an ML pipeline for multiclass classification of time-series data yields the same classification performance, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. To achieve this, we use a VQC based on a single qudit, and encode the classical data into the VQC via a trainable hybrid autoencoder which has been recently proposed as embedding technique. Our results highlight the importance of tailored data pre-processing for the circuit and show the potential of qudit-based VQCs.</description>

      <title>SVTest: general purpose software for testing weakly random sources with exemplary application to seismic data analysis enabling quantum amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating private randomness is essential for numerous applications ranging from security proofs to online banking. Consequently, the capacity of quantum devices to amplify the privacy of a weak source of randomness, in cases unattainable by classical methods, constitutes a practical advantage. One of the theoretical models of such weak sources are the so-called Santha-Vazirani (SV) sources; however, finding natural sources satisfying the SV model is a paramount challenge. In this article, we take three significant steps on the way to simplify this hard task. We begin with an in-depth analysis of the mathematical background for estimating the quality of a weak randomness source by providing a set of axioms that systematize the possible approaches to such estimation. We then develop software (SVTest) to estimate the parameter characterizing the source's randomness. The software is general-purpose, i.e., it can test the randomness of any target sequence of bits. Later, we apply the software to test seismic events (earthquakes and local noise) as potential sources of randomness. Our results demonstrate that seismic phenomena are possible sources of randomness, depending on the choice of discretization. Therefore, our work provides strong evidence of the potential of geophysical phenomena as a source of cryptographic resources, building an unprecedented bridge between both fields.</description>

      <title>A Measurement Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution protocol in the service of three users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is the only theoretically proven method for secure key distribution between two users. In this work, we propose and analyze a Measurement Device Independent (MDI) protocol designed to distribute keys among three users in a pairwise manner. Each user randomly selects a basis, encodes bit values in the phase of coherent states, and sends the resulting pulses to a central measurement unit (MU) composed of three beam splitters and three photon detectors. When the three pulses arrive simultaneously at the MU and under the condition of successful detection of photons, a key bit is distributed to at least one pair of users. This protocol extends the foundational phase-encoding MDI protocol introduced by [K. Tamaki, et al., Phys. Rev. A 85, 042307 (2012)] to three users, but this comes at the cost of introducing a systematic error in the implementation of the honest protocol.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional points in composite non-Hermitan systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a composite quantum system described by the tensor product of multiple systems each with a leading-order exceptional point (a non-Hermitian degeneracy at which not only eigenvalues but also eigenstates coalesce) exhibits a single leading-order exceptional point, whose order surpasses the order of any constituent exceptional point. The formation of such higher-order exceptional points does not require coupling among the subsystems. We determine explicitly the order and the spectral response strength of this exceptional point. Moreover, we observe that the energy eigenstates that do not merge are entangled. Finally, we demonstrate that general initial states disentangle during time evolution due to the presence of the higher-order exceptional point of the composite system.</description>

      <title>More-efficient Quantum Multivariate Mean Value Estimator from Generalized Grover Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for multivariate mean value estimation. Our algorithm outperforms previous work by polylog factors and nearly saturates the known lower bound. We find an algorithm that uses $O\left(n \log \frac{d}{\delta}\right)$ to achieve precision $\frac{\sqrt{\text{tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\lVert \rVert_\infty$ norm and hence $\frac{\sqrt{d \text{ tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\lVert \rVert_2$ norm, where $d$ is the dimension and $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. We also presented another algorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\frac{1}{4}$ in complexity. The idea originates from the previous observations that the Grover gate, when generalized to allow for arbitrary phases instead of $\pm 1$, becomes a good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion. The only remaining $\log \frac{d}{\delta}$ as opposed to $\log \frac{1}{\delta}$ is due to the phase estimation primitive we employed, which so far is the only major known method to tackle the problem. Our results demonstrates that our methodology with generalized Grover gate can be used locate the optimal algorithm, without polylog overhead, for different taks relating to mean value estimation.</description>

      <title>An improved quantum algorithm for linear autonomous differential equations via Pad\'e approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Pad\'e approximation. For linear autonomous ODEs, the discretized solution can be represented by a product of matrix exponentials. The proposed algorithm approximates the matrix exponential by the diagonal Pad\'e approximation, which is then encoded into a large, block-sparse linear system and solved via quantum linear system algorithms (QLSA). The detailed quantum circuit is given based on quantum oracle access to the matrix, the inhomogeneous term, and the initial state. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Compared to the method based on Taylor approximation, which approximates the matrix exponential using a $k$-th order Taylor series, the proposed algorithm improves the approximation order $k$ from two perspectives: 1) the explicit complexity dependency on $k$ is improved, and 2) a smaller $k$ suffices for the same precision. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm comparing to other related algorithms.</description>

      <title>GLT hidden structures in mean-field quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores structured matrix sequences arising in mean-field quantum spin systems. We express these sequences within the framework of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) $*$-algebras, leveraging the fact that each GLT matrix sequence has a unique GLT symbol. This symbol characterizes both the asymptotic singular value distribution and, for Hermitian or quasi-Hermitian sequences, the asymptotic spectral distribution. Specifically, we analyze two cases of real symmetric matrix sequences stemming from mean-field quantum spin systems and determine their associated distributions using GLT theory. Our study concludes with visualizations and numerical tests that validate the theoretical findings, followed by a discussion of open problems and future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Quantum Supremacy regime, quantum computers may overcome classical machines on several tasks if we can estimate, mitigate, or correct unavoidable hardware noise. Estimating the error requires classical simulations, which become unfeasible in the Quantum Supremacy regime. We leverage Machine Learning data-driven approaches and Conformal Prediction, a Machine Learning uncertainty quantification tool known for its mild assumptions and finite-sample validity, to find theoretically valid upper bounds of the fidelity between noiseless and noisy outputs of quantum devices. Under reasonable extrapolation assumptions, the proposed scheme applies to any Quantum Computing hardware, does not require modeling the device's noise sources, and can be used when classical simulations are unavailable, e.g. in the Quantum Supremacy regime.</description>

      <title>Swinging small quantum systems out of available values of control parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a quantum system is prepared in its many-body ground state, it can be adiabatically driven to another ground state by changing its control parameter. However, relying on adiabaticity is experimentally unjustified. Moreover, the target value of the control parameter may occur outside the experimentally accessible range. The indicated target state, however, can still be reached within a clever protocol of temporal changes of the control parameter provided its decomposition into some basis is known. It turns out that such a protocol can be obtained in the framework of the optimal control theory. In this paper, we show how to apply such an optimization scheme to small quantum systems treating interaction strength as the control parameter. We believe that the proposed approach can be creatively extended to various complex quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements at the Large Hadron Collider have observed entanglement in the spins of $t\bar t$ pairs. The effects of radiation, which are expected to lead to quantum decoherence and a reduction of entanglement, are generally neglected in such measurements. In this letter we calculate the effects of decoherence from various different types of radiation for a maximally entangled pair of fermions -- a bipartite system of qubits in a Bell state. We identify the Kraus operators describing the evolution of the open quantum system with the integrated Altarelli-Parisi splitting functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverse Shannon theorems concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate noisy ones. This is dual to the usual noisy channel coding problem, where a noisy (classical or quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one. The Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem is extensively studied by Bennett and co-authors in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2014]. They present two distinct theorems, each tailored to classical and quantum channel simulations respectively, explaining the fact that these theorems remain incomparable due to the fundamentally different nature of correlations they address. The authors leave as an open question the challenge of formulating a unified theorem that could encompass the principles of both and unify them. We unify these two theorems into a single, comprehensive theorem, extending it to the most general case by considering correlations with a general mixed-state reference system. Furthermore, we unify feedback and non-feedback theorems by simulating a general side information system at the encoder side.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approach towards Quantum Error Mitigation for Accurate Molecular Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant efforts, the realization of the hybrid quantum-classical algorithms has predominantly been confined to proof-of-principles, mainly due to the hardware noise. With fault-tolerant implementation being a long-term goal, going beyond small molecules with existing error mitigation (EM) techniques with current noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices has been a challenge. That being said, statistical learning methods are promising approaches to learning the noise and its subsequent mitigation. We devise a graph neural network and regression-based machine learning (ML) architecture for practical realization of EM techniques for molecular Hamiltonian without the requirement of the exponential overhead. Given the short coherence time of the quantum hardware, the ML model is trained with either ideal or mitigated expectation values over a judiciously chosen ensemble of shallow sub-circuits adhering to the native hardware architecture. The hardware connectivity network is mapped to a directed graph which encodes the information of the native gate noise profile to generate the features for the neural network. The training data is generated on-the-fly during ansatz construction thus removing the computational overhead. We demonstrate orders of magnitude improvements in predicted energy over a few strongly correlated molecules.</description>

      <title>Computing Canonical Averages with Quantum and Classical Optimizers: Thermodynamic Reweighting for QUBO Models of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general method to compute canonical averages for physical models sampled via quantum or classical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). First, we introduce a histogram reweighting scheme applicable to QUBO-based sampling constrained to specific intervals of an order parameter, e.g., physical energy. Next, we demonstrate that the scheme can accurately recover the density of states, which in turn allows for calculating expectation values in the conjugate ensemble, e.g., at a fixed temperature. The method can thus be used to advance the state-of-the-art characterization of physical systems that admit a QUBO-based representation and that are otherwise intractable with real-space sampling methods. A case in point are space-filling melts of lattice ring polymers, recently mapped in QUBO form, for which our method reveals that the ring catenation probability is non-monotonic with the bending rigidity.</description>

      <title>Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm design paradigm called combine and conquer, which is a quantum version of the "marriage-before-conquest" technique of Kirkpatrick and Seidel. In a quantum combine-and-conquer algorithm, one performs the essential computation of the combine step of a quantum divide-and-conquer algorithm prior to the conquer step while avoiding recursion. This model is better suited for the quantum setting, due to its non-recursive nature. We show the utility of this approach by providing quantum algorithms for 2D maxima set and convex hull problems for sorted point sets running in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nh})$ time, w.h.p., where $h$ is the size of the output.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A leading theory for the biological effects of low-intensity magnetic fields is the spin-chemical Radical Pair Mechanism. This mechanism is best described by the master equation for the density matrix of an open quantum system, which includes terms for Hamiltonian evolution, thermal spin relaxation, and chemical kinetics. In this study, we have found a solution to this equation for a simplified radical pair model and shown that a significant magnetic effect occurs when the following condition is met: $\gamma H \tau \gtrsim 1 + \kappa \tau$, where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, $H$ is the magnetic field strength, $\tau$ is the relaxation time, and $\kappa$ is the rate of chemical kinetics.</description>

      <title>Defects in Silicon Carbide as Quantum Qubits: Recent Advances in Defect Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review provides an overview of defects in silicon carbide (SiC) with potential applications as quantum qubits. It begins with a brief introduction to quantum qubits and existing qubit platforms, outlining the essential criteria a defect must meet to function as a viable qubit. The focus then shifts to the most promising defects in SiC, notably the silicon vacancy (VSi) and divacancy (VC-VSi). A key challenge in utilizing these defects for quantum applications is their precise and controllable creation. Various fabrication techniques, including irradiation, ion implantation, femtosecond laser processing, and focused ion beam methods, have been explored to create these defects. Designed as a beginner-friendly resource, this review aims to support early-career experimental researchers entering the field of SiC-related quantum qubits. Providing an introduction to defect-based qubits in SiC offers valuable insights into fabrication strategies, recent progress, and the challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Emergent Metric from Wavelet-transformed Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method of reverse holography by which a bulk metric is shown to arise from locally computable multiscale correlations of a boundary quantum field theory (QFT). The metric is obtained from the Petz-R\'enyi mutual information using as input the correlations computed from the continuous wavelet transform. We show for free massless fermionic and bosonic QFTs that the emerging metric is asymptotically anti-de Sitter space (AdS), and that the parameters fixing the geometry are tunable by changing the chosen wavelet basis. The method is applicable to a variety of boundary QFTs that need not be conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Fermionic Field Entanglement in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore entanglement harvesting using two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors linearly coupled to the scalar density
  of a massless spin-1/2 field in 1+1 Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider different vacua, including the Boulware, Hartle Hawking-Israel (HHI), and Unruh vacua, and investigate various configurations depending on the choice of 2-bein in the
  interaction Hamiltonian. We find that the transition rate of the static UDW detector exhibits the expected Planckian
  behavior in the HHI state, while the Unruh state leads to the Helmholtz free energy density of a bosonic or fermionic
  thermal bath corresponding to the static or conformal 2-bein respectively. Further, we observe that the anti-Hawking
  effect enhances the entanglement between the two detectors while the gravitational redshift and Hawking radiation
  decreases it. In particular, due to the presence of the anti-Hawking effect, the mutual information and concurrence
  near the event horizon can be non-zero even for static detectors with static 2-bein, which is in contrast with the case
  of scalar field. We also show that the near-horizon entanglement properties for static detectors in the HHI state have
  similar behaviour with those in Minkowski vacua for uniformly accelerated detectors in Rindler spacetime. Conclusions
  are discussed.</description>

      <title>Identifying and mitigating errors in hole spin qubit readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity readout of spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots can be achieved by combining a radio-frequency (RF) charge sensor together with spin-to-charge conversion and Pauli spin blockade. However, reaching high readout fidelities in hole spin qubits remains elusive and is complicated by a combination of site-dependent spin anisotropies and short spin relaxation times. Here, we analyze the different error processes that arise during readout using a double-latched scheme in a germanium double quantum dot hole spin qubit system. We first investigate the spin-to-charge conversion process as a function of magnetic field orientation, and configure the system to adiabatically map the $\lvert \downarrow\downarrow \rangle$ state to the only non-blockaded state. We reveal a strong dependence of the spin relaxation rates on magnetic field strength and minimize this relaxation by operating at low fields. We further characterize and mitigate the error processes that arise during the double-latching process. By combining an RF charge sensor, a double-latching process, and optimized magnetic field parameters, we achieve a single-shot single-qubit state-preparation-and-measurement fidelity of 97.0%, the highest reported fidelity for hole spin qubits. Unlike prior works and vital to usability, we simultaneously maintain universal control of both spins. These findings lay the foundation for the reproducible achievement of high-fidelity readout in hole-based spin quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe resonant dipolar interactions between ultracold $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb molecules and Rydberg $^{87}$Rb atoms in an optically trapped ensemble. Through state-selective ionization detection of the KRb molecules, we observe resonant energy transfer at 2.227 GHz from Rydberg atoms to molecules under a tunable external electric field. We measure a broadening up to 3.5 MHz, for the Rb Rydberg excitation spectrum, which matches a Monte Carlo simulation that describes a Rydberg atom and neighboring molecules evolving under a dipole-dipole interacting Hamiltonian. The demonstrated interspecies dipolar interaction is a key ingredient for hybrid Rydberg-polar molecule systems, where the advantages of each system can be leveraged and combined.</description>

      <title>Exact Current Fluctuations in a Tight-Binding Chain with Dephasing Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on an infinite interval, we exactly calculate the variance of the integrated current for a step initial condition with average densities, $\rho_a$ on the negative axis and $\rho_b$ on the positive axis. Our exact solution reveals that the presence of dephasing, no matter how small, alters the nature of current fluctuations from ballistic to diffusive in the long-time limit. The derivation relies on the Bethe ansatz on the infinite interval and a nontrivial parameter dependence, referred to as the $\omega$-dependence, of the moment generating function for the integrated current. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic form of the variance and a numerically obtained cumulant generating function coincide with those in the symmetric simple exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold: gaplessness, order parameter, and scaling in $d$-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study several models of $d$-dimensional fermions ($d=1,2,3$) with an emphasis on the properties of their gapless (metallic) phase. It occurs at $T = 0$ as a continuous transition when zeros of the partition function reach the real range of parameters. Those zeros define the $(d-1)$-manifold of quantum criticality (Fermi surface). Its appearance or restructuring correspond to the Lifshitz transition. Such $(d-1)$-membrane breaks the symmetry of the momentum space, leading to gapless excitations, a hallmark of metallic phase. To probe quantitatively the gapless phase we introduce the geometric order parameter as $d$-volume of the Fermi sea. From analysis of the chain, ladder, and free fermions with different spectra, this proposal is shown to be consistent with scaling near the Lifshitz points of other quantities: correlation length, oscillation wavelength, susceptibilities, and entanglement. All the (hyper)scaling relations are satisfied. Two interacting cases of the Tomonaga-Luttinger ($d=1$) and the Fermi ($d=2,3$) liquids are analysed, yielding the same universality classes as free fermions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Numerical Renormalization Group: Solution of the non-Hermitian Kondo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonians describe open quantum systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and dissipative processes. Although a rich range of single-particle NH physics has been uncovered, many-body phenomena in strongly correlated NH systems have been far less well studied. The Kondo effect, an important paradigm for strong correlation physics, has recently been considered in the NH setting. Here we develop a NH generalization of the numerical renormalization group (NRG) and use it to solve the NH Kondo model. Our non-perturbative solution applies beyond weak coupling, and we uncover a nontrivial phase diagram. The method is showcased by application to the NH pseudogap Kondo model, which we show supports a completely novel phase with a genuine NH stable fixed point and complex eigenspectrum. Our NH-NRG code, which can be used in regimes and for models inaccessible to, e.g., perturbative scaling and Bethe ansatz, is provided open source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with a multireference unitary coupled cluster ansatz to report the ground state energy of the BeH$_2$ molecule in a geometry where strong correlation effects are significant. We consider the two most important determinants in the construction of the reference state for our ansatz. Furthermore, in order to carry out our intended 12-qubit computation on a noisy intermediate scale quantum era trapped ion hardware (the commercially available IonQ Forte-I), we perform a series of resource reduction techniques to a. decrease the number of two-qubit gates by 99.84% (from 12515 to 20 two-qubit gates) relative to the unoptimized circuit, and b. reduce the number of measurements via the idea of supercliques, while losing 2.69% in the obtained ground state energy (with error mitigation and post-selection) relative to that computed classically for the same resource-optimized problem setting.</description>

      <title>The membership problem for constant-sized quantum correlations is undecidable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.11087v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two spatially separated parties make measurements on an unknown entangled quantum state, what correlations can they achieve? How difficult is it to determine whether a given correlation is a quantum correlation? These questions are central to problems in quantum communication and computation. Previous work has shown that the general membership problem for quantum correlations is computationally undecidable. In the current work we show something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations -- that is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement outcomes are fixed -- such that solving the quantum membership problem for this family is computationally impossible. Thus, the undecidability that arises in understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of measurements in the experiment. This places strong constraints on the types of descriptions that can be given for quantum correlation sets. Our proof is based on a combination of techniques from quantum self-testing and from undecidability results of the third author for linear system nonlocal games.</description>

      <title>Parallel repetition of local simultaneous state discrimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local simultaneous state discrimination (LSSD) is a recently introduced problem in quantum information processing. Its classical version is a non-local game played by non-communicating players against a referee. Based on a known probability distribution, the referee generates one input for each of the players and keeps one secret value. The players have to guess the referee's value and win if they all do so. For this game, we investigate the advantage of no-signalling strategies over classical ones. We show numerically that for three players and binary values, no-signalling strategies cannot provide any improvement over classical ones. For a certain LSSD game based on a binary symmetric channel, we show that no-signalling strategies are strictly better when multiple simultaneous instances of the game are played. Good classical strategies for this game can be defined by codes, and good no-signalling strategies by list-decoding schemes. We expand this example game to a class of games defined by an arbitrary channel, and extend the idea of using codes and list decoding to define strategies for multiple simultaneous instances of these games. Finally, we give an expression for the limit of the exponent of the classical winning probability, and show that no-signalling strategies based on list-decoding schemes achieve this limit.</description>

Abstract: A coinless quantisation procedure of general reversible Markov chains on graphs is presented. A quantum Hamiltonian H is obtained by a similarity transformation of the fundamental transition probability matrix K in terms of the square root of the reversible distribution. The evolution of the classical and quantum Markov chains is described by the solutions of the eigenvalue problem of the quantum Hamiltonian H. About twenty plus exactly solvable Markov chains based on the hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of Askey scheme, derived by Odake-Sasaki, would provide a good window for scrutinising the quantum/classical contrast of Markov chains. Among them five explicit examples, related to the Krawtchouk, Hahn, q-Hahn, Charlier and Meixner, are demonstrated to illustrate the actual calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the minimum entanglement needed to prepare quantum states and implement quantum processes is a key challenge in quantum information theory. In this work, we develop computable and faithful lower bounds on the entanglement cost under quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial transpose (PPT operations), by introducing logarithmic $k$-negativity, a generalization of logarithmic negativity. Our bounds are efficiently computable via semidefinite programming and provide non-trivial values for all states that are not PPT, establishing their faithfulness. Notably, we find and affirm the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation under PPT operations for full-rank entangled states. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost of both point-to-point and bipartite quantum channels. Our bound demonstrates improvements over previously known computable bounds for a wide range of states and channels. These findings push the boundaries of understanding the structure of entanglement and the fundamental limits of entanglement manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended non-local games are a generalization of monogamy-of-entanglement games, played by two quantum parties and a quantum referee that performs a measurement on their local quantum system. Along the lines of the NPA hierarchy, the optimal winning probability of those games can be upper bounded by a hierarchy of semidefinite programs (SDPs) converging to the optimal value. Here, we show that if one extends such games by considering constraints and loss, motivated by experimental errors and loss through quantum communication, the convergence of the SDPs to the optimal value still holds. We give applications of this result, and we compute SDPs that show tighter security of protocols for relativistic bit commitment, quantum key distribution, and quantum position verification.</description>

      <title>Self-testing in the compiled setting via tilted-CHSH inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a Bell scenario, a classical verifier interacts with two non-communicating (quantum) provers. To an observer, the behaviour of the provers in this interaction is modeled by correlations. Certain correlations allow the verifier to certify, or self-test, the underlying quantum state and measurements. Self-testing underpins numerous device-independent quantum protocols with a classical verifier, yet, a drawback of using self-tests in applications is the required no-communicating assumption between the provers. To address this issue, Kalai et al.~(STOC '23) introduce a cryptographic procedure which "compiles" these scenarios into a multi-round interaction between a verifier and a single computationally bounded prover. In this work, we formalize a notion of self-testing for compiled two-prover Bell scenarios. In addition, we prove that the quantum value is preserved under compilation for the family of tilted-CHSH inequalities (up to negligible factors). We also show that any maximal violation in the compiled setting of inequalities from this family satisfies a notion of self-testing in the compiled setting. More specifically, we show that maximal violations of these inequalities imply the existence of an efficient isometry that recovers the measurement action on the state after the first round.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum resources in a semi-device independent framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether one can detect the presence of a quantum resource in some operational task or equivalently whether every quantum resource provides an advantage over its free counterpart in some black box scenarios where one does not have much information about the devices. For any dimension $d$, we find that for any resource theory with less than $d^2$ number of linearly independent free states or free operations, there exist correlations that can detect the presence of a quantum resource. For this purpose, we introduce the framework for detecting quantum resources semi-device independently by considering the prepare-and-measure scenario with the restriction on the dimension of the quantum channel connecting the preparation box with the measurement box. We then explicitly construct witnesses to observe the presence of various quantum resources. We expect these results will open avenues for detecting and finding uses of quantum resources in general operational tasks.</description>

      <title>Optical pumping through the Liouvillian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Liouvillian skin effect describes the boundary affinity of Liouvillian eignemodes that originates from the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of the Liouvillian superoperators. Dynamically, it manifests as directional flow in the transient dynamics, and the accumulation of population near open boundaries at long times. Intriguingly, similar dynamic phenomena exist in the well-known process of optical pumping, where the system is driven into a desired state (or a dark-state subspace) through the interplay of dissipation and optical drive. In this work, we show that typical optical pumping processes can indeed be understood in terms of the Liouvillian skin effect. By studying the Liouvillian spectra under different boundary conditions, we reveal that the Liouvillian spectra of the driven-dissipative pumping process sensitively depend on the boundary conditions in the state space, a signature that lies at the origin of the Liouvillian skin effect. Such a connection provides insights and practical means for designing efficient optical-pumping schemes through engineering Liouvillian gaps under the open-boundary condition. Based on these understandings, we show that the efficiency of a typical side-band cooling scheme for trapped ions can be dramatically enhanced by introducing counterintuitive dissipative channels. Our results provide a useful perspective for optical pumping, with interesting implications for state preparation and cooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage via Efficient Post-processing on Qudit Shadow tomography</title>

Abstract: Computing inner products of the form \( \operatorname{tr}(AB) \), where \( A \) is a \( d \)-dimensional density matrix (with \( \operatorname{tr}(A) = 1 \), \( A \geq 0 \)) and \( B \) is a bounded-norm observable (Hermitian with \( \operatorname{tr}(B^2) \le O(\mathrm{poly}(\log d)) \) and \( \operatorname{tr}(B) \) known), is fundamental across quantum science and artificial intelligence. Classically, both computing and storing such inner products require $O(d^2)$ resources, which rapidly becomes prohibitive as $d$ grows exponentially. In this work, we introduce a quantum approach based on qudit classical shadow tomography, significantly reducing computational complexity from $O(d^2)$ down to $O(\mathrm{poly}(\log d))$ in typical cases and at least to $O(d~ \text{poly}(\log d))$ in the worst case. Specifically, for \(n\)-qubit systems (with $n$ being the number of qubit and \(d = 2^n\)), our method guarantees efficient estimation of \(\operatorname{tr}(\rho O)\) for any known stabilizer state \(\rho\) and arbitrary bounded-norm observable \(O\), using polynomial computational resources.
  Crucially, it ensures constant-time classical post-processing per measurement and supports qubit and qudit platforms. Moreover, classical storage complexity of $A$ reduces from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m \log d)$, where the sample complexity $m$ is typically exponentially smaller than $d^2$. Our results establish a practical and modular quantum subroutine, enabling scalable quantum advantages in tasks involving high-dimensional data analysis and processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental tests of gravity's fundamental nature call for mechanical systems in the quantum regime while being sensitive to gravity. Torsion pendula, historically vital in studies of classical gravity, are ideal for extending gravitational tests into the quantum realm due to their inherently high mechanical quality factor, even when mass-loaded. Here, we demonstrate laser cooling of a centimeter-scale torsional oscillator to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature. This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the torsional mode with an imprecision 9.8 dB below its peak zero-point motion. The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($1.4\times 10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Compressing Hamiltonians with \emph{ab initio} downfolding for simulating strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. \emph{Ab initio} downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving compressed many-body Hamiltonians that maintain the essential physics of strongly-correlated materials. The solution of these material-specific models is still exponentially difficult to generate on classical computers, but quantum algorithms allow for a significant speed-up in obtaining the ground states of these compressed Hamiltonians. Here we demonstrate that utilizing quantum algorithms for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians can indeed yield high-fidelity solutions. By combining \emph{ab initio} downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, we correctly predict the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. Numerical simulations utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers allow us to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address. Through these methods we demonstrate the potential of classical pre-optimization and downfolding techniques for enabling efficient materials simulation using quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Variational techniques have long been at the heart of atomic, solid-state, and many-body physics. They have recently extended to quantum and classical machine learning, providing a basis for representing quantum states via neural networks. These methods generally aim to minimize the energy of a given ans\"atz, though open questions remain about the expressivity of quantum and classical variational ans\"atze. The connection between variational techniques and quantum computing, through variational quantum algorithms, offers opportunities to explore the quantum complexity of classical methods. We demonstrate how the concept of non-stabilizerness, or magic, can create a bridge between quantum information and variational techniques and we show that energy accuracy is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for accuracy in non-stabilizerness. Through systematic benchmarking of neural network quantum states, matrix product states, and variational quantum methods, we show that while classical techniques are more accurate in non-stabilizerness, not accounting for the symmetries of the system can have a severe impact on this accuracy. Our findings form a basis for a universal expressivity characterization of both quantum and classical variational methods.</description>

      <title>Fully smooth one shot multipartite covering and decoupling of quantum states via telescoping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove fully smooth one shot multipartite covering, aka convex split, results as well as fully smooth multipartite decoupling results for quantum states. Fully smooth one shot results for these problems were not known earlier, though the works of Cheng, Gao and Berta (arXiv:2304.12056) for convex split, and Colomer and Winter (arXiv:2304.12114) for decoupling, had made substantial progress by introducing a technique called telescoping cum mean zero decomposition of quantum states. We show that the telescoping cum mean zero decomposition technique can in fact be simplified and further extended in order to prove fully smooth decoupling and convex split results.
  Our techniques allow us to prove the first fully smooth one shot inner bounds for various fundamental network quantum information theory problems like e.g. the generalised Slepian Wolf problem of Anshu, Jain and Warsi (arXiv:1703.09961). We can also prove for the first time the natural polyhedral inner bound for sending quantum information over a quantum multiple access channel with limited entanglement assistance, first conjectured in Chakraborty, Nema and Sen (arXiv::2102.02187).</description>

      <title>Kerr-cat Qubit Operations Below the Fault-tolerant Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ubiquitous noise in quantum system hinders the advancement of quantum information processing and has driven the emergence of different quantum error correction protocols. Among them, quantum error correction codes tailored for noise-biased qubits exhibit comparatively high error thresholds, making them a promising platform to achieve fault-tolerance. Nevertheless, their quantum operations are challenging and the demonstration of their performance beyond the fault-tolerant threshold remains incomplete. Here, we leverage Schr\"odinger cat states in scalable planar superconducting circuits to thoroughly characterize the high-fidelity single-qubit quantum operations on noise-biased qubits with systematic quantum tomography and benchmarking tools, demonstrating their state-of-the-art performance beyond the fault-tolerant threshold of the surface code. These results thus embody a transformative milestone in the exploration of quantum systems with structured noises. Notably, our framework is extensible to other structured-noise systems, paving the way for systematic characterization and validation of novel quantum platforms with structured noise.</description>

      <title>Phantom Edges in the Problem Hamiltonian: A Method for Increasing Performance and Graph Visibility for QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. However, a major limitation of QAOA is that it is a "local" algorithm for finite circuit depths, meaning it can only optimize over local properties of the graph. In this paper, we present Phantom-QAOA, a new QAOA ansatz that introduces only one additional parameter to the standard ansatz -- regardless of system size -- allowing QAOA to "see" more of the graph at a given depth $p$. We achieve this by modifying the target graph to include additional $\alpha$-weighted edges, with $\alpha$ serving as a tunable parameter. This modified graph is then used to construct the phase operator and allows QAOA to explore a wider range of the graph's features. We derive a general formula for our new ansatz at $p=1$ and analytically show an improvement in the approximation ratio for cycle graphs. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrate significant improvements in the approximation ratio for the Max-Cut problem over the standard QAOA ansatz for $p=1$ and $p=2$ on random regular graphs up to 16 nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Perfect Domination Problem (PDP), a classical challenge in combinatorial optimization, has significant applications in real-world scenarios, such as wireless and social networks. Over several decades of research, the problem has been demonstrated to be NP-complete across numerous graph classes. With the recent advancements in quantum computing, there has been a surge in the development of quantum algorithms aimed at addressing NP-complete problems, including the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). However, the applicability of quantum algorithms to the PDP, as well as their efficacy in solving it, remains unexplored. This study represents a pioneering effort to apply QAOA to address the PDP. Comprehensive testing and analysis were conducted across 420 distinct parameter combinations. Experimental results indicate that QAOA successfully identified the correct Perfect Dominating Set (PDS) in 82 cases, including 17 instances where the optimal PDS was computed. Furthermore, it was observed that with appropriate parameter settings, the approximation ratio could achieve a value close to 0.9. These findings underscore the potential of QAOA as a viable approach for solving the PDP, signifying an important milestone that introduces this problem into the realm of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks have the potential to be seamlessly integrated with quantum devices for the automatic recognition of quantum states. However, performing complex tasks requires a large number of neurons densely connected through trainable, parameterized weights - a challenging feat when using qubits. To address this, we propose leveraging bosonic modes and performing Fock basis measurements, enabling the extraction of an exponential number of features relative to the number of modes. Unlike qubits, bosons can be coupled through multiple parametric drives, with amplitudes, phases, and frequency detunings serving dual purposes: data encoding and trainable parameters. We demonstrate that these parameters, despite their differing physical dimensions, can be trained cohesively using backpropagation to solve benchmark tasks of increasing complexity. Notably, we show that the network can be trained even though the number of trainable parameters scales only linearly with the number of modes, whereas the number of neurons grows exponentially. Furthermore, we show that training not only reduces the number of measurements required for feature extraction compared to untrained quantum neural networks, such as quantum reservoir computing, but also significantly enhances the expressivity of the network, enabling it to solve tasks that are out of reach for quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph states are the key resources for measurement- and fusion-based quantum computing with photons, yet their creation is experimentally challenging. We optimize a hybrid graph-state generation scheme using a single quantum emitter and linear optics Bell-state measurements called fusions. We first generate a restricted class of states from a single quantum emitter and then apply fusions to create a target graph state, where we use a dynamic programming approach to find the construction that requires the lowest possible number of fusions. Our analysis yields a lookup table for constructing $\sim 2.8\times 10^7$ non-isomorphic graph states with the minimum number of fusions. The lookup table covers all graph states with up to eight qubits and several other ones with up to 14 qubits. We present construction protocols of selected graph states and provide the lookup table. For large graph states that are not in the lookup table, we derive bounds for the required number of fusions using graph-theoretic properties. Finally, we use the lookup table to search for the best graph codes for loss-tolerant encodings, given a fixed number of fusions for their construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum dynamics, the Loschmidt amplitude is analogous to the partition function in the canonical ensemble. Zeros in the partition function indicate a phase transition, while the presence of zeros in the Loschmidt amplitude indicates a dynamical quantum phase transition. Based on the classical-quantum correspondence, we demonstrate that the partition function of a classical Ising model is equivalent to the Loschmidt amplitude in non-Hermitian dynamics, thereby mapping an Ising model with variable system size to the non-Hermitian dynamics. It follows that the Yang-Lee zeros and the Yang-Lee edge singularity of the classical Ising model correspond to the critical times of the dynamic quantum phase transitions and the exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, respectively. Our work reveals an inner connection between Yang-Lee zeros and non-Hermitian dynamics, offering a dynamic characterization of the former.</description>

      <title>Short two-qubit pulse sequences for exchange-only spin qubits in 2D layouts</title>

Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) spin qubits in quantum dots offer an expansive design landscape for architecting scalable device layouts. The study of two-EO-qubit operations, which involve six electrons in six quantum dots, has so far been limited to a small number of the possible configurations, and previous works lack analyses of design considerations and implications for quantum error correction. Using a simple and fast optimization method, we generate complete pulse sequences for CX, CZ, iSWAP, leakage-controlled CX, and leakage-controlled CZ two-qubit gates on 450 unique planar six-dot topologies and analyze differences in sequence length (up to 43\% reduction) across topology classes. In addition, we show that relaxing constraints on post-operation spin locations can yield further reductions in sequence length; conversely, constraining these locations in a particular way generates a CXSWAP operation with minimal additional cost over a standard CX. We integrate this pulse library into the Intel quantum stack and experimentally verify pulse sequences on a Tunnel Falls chip for different operations in a linear-connectivity device to confirm that they work as expected. Finally, we explore architectural implications of these results for quantum error correction. Our work guides hardware and software design choices for future implementations of scalable quantum dot architectures.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Entanglement in Systems of Three Indistinguishable Bosons: Revisiting the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinge State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the concept of entanglement for distinguishable particles is well established, defining entanglement and non-locality in systems of indistinguishable particles, which require the use of the (anti)symmetrization postulate, remains challenging, and multiple approaches have been proposed to address this issue. In this work we study the problem of detecting genuine tripartite entanglement among systems of indistinguishable bosons. A genuine entangled state is one that cannot be separable under any bipartition, where separability in the indistinguishable regime is defined by the existence of single particle properties within each subsystem, without the possibility of knowing which property belongs to which subsystem. We use an algorithm that allows us to search for these single particle properties and, consequently, rank states according to their degree of separability. In particular, we introduce a state of indistinguishable bosons with analogous properties to those of the standard GHZ state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Carrier transition is one of the major factors hindering the high-speed implementation of the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates in trapped-ion quantum processors. We present an approach to design laser pulse shapes for the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate in ion chains which accounts for the effect of carrier transition on qubit-phonon dynamics. We show that the fast-oscillating carrier term effectively modifies the spin-dependent forces acting on ions, and this can be compensated by a simple nonlinear transformation of a laser pulse. Using numerical simulations for short ion chains and perturbation theory for longer chains up to $20$ ions, we demonstrate that our approach allows to reach the infidelity below $10^{-4}$ while keeping the gate duration of the order of tens of microseconds.</description>

      <title>Wigner Function of Observed Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wigner function was introduced as an attempt to describe quantum-mechanical fields with the tools inherited from classical statistical mechanics. In particular, it is widely used to describe the properties of radiation fields. In fact, a useful way to distinguish between classical and nonclassical states of light is to ask whether their Wigner function has a Gaussian profile or not, respectively. In this paper, we use the basis of Fock states to provide the closed-form expression for the Wigner function of an arbitrary quantum state. Thus, we provide the general expression for the Wigner function of a squeezed Fock, coherent and thermal states, with an arbitrary squeezing parameter. Then, we consider the most fundamental quantum system, Resonance Fluorescence, and obtain closed-form expressions for its Wigner function under various excitation regimes. With them, we discuss the conditions for obtaining a negative-valued Wigner function and the relation it has with population inversion. Finally, we address the problem of the observation of the radiation field, introducing physical detectors into the description of the emission. Notably, we show how to expose the quantumness of a radiation field that has been observed with a detector with finite spectral resolution, even if the observed Wigner function is completely positive.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. While each phase follows its parallel-transport condition, we also consider the non-adiabatic IGP for arbitrary unitary evolution beyond parallel transport. For the $j=3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase shows temperature-induced topological phase transitions with jumps. The IGP and non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=3/2$ CSS also exhibits temperature-induced jumps. In contrast, the Uhlmann phase of the $j=1$ one-axis SSS exhibits smooth behavior without any temperature-induced transition. Interestingly, the parallel-transport condition of the IGP of the $j=1$ one-axis SSS only admits a trivial solution at finite temperature while the non-adiabatic IGP for the $j=1$ one-axis SSS has a solution showing smooth behavior as the squeezing parameter and temperature change. By considering $j=1$ two-axis SSS, the IGP and its non-adiabatic generalization exhibit smooth behavior at finite temperatures. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications and simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezed light constitutes a key resource for quantum optical technologies including quantum sensing, computing, communication and metrology. For many applications the generation of squeezed light typically requires at least two nonlinear optical stages involving careful phase and frequency matching to achieve the required mixing of squeezed and coherent light. In our work, we introduce an on-chip system that simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light, utilizing only a single squeezing stage. We achieve this by pumping a silicon nitride ($\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$) microring resonator to produce single-mode squeezed light through four-wave mixing at the same frequency as the pump mode, leveraging the inherent $\chi^{(3)}$-nonlinearity of the $\mathrm{Si_3N_4}$ resonator. Our on-chip system demonstrates a squeezing of -4.7 dB with a clear perspective towards -10 dB squeezing. We also provide a theoretical model that describes the straightforward yet robust generation of single-mode squeezing at the injection locking point of the ring resonator. In fact, we show that a design with a normal dispersion can be used for robust generation of bright squeezed light without the need for careful suppression of unwanted nonlinear processes. Overall, our findings highlight an approach which drastically simplifies the generation of coherent-squeezed light in photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Making Truncated Wigner for dissipative spins 'plain easy'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a user-friendly framework of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) for dissipative quantum many-body systems. Our approach is computationally affordable and it features a straightforward implementation. The leverage of the method can be ultimately traced to an intimate connection between the TWA and the semi-classical limit of the quantum Langevin equation, which we unveil by resorting to a path integral representation of the Lindbladian. Our approach allows us to explore dynamics from early to late times in a variety of models at the core of modern AMO research, including lasing, central spin models, driven arrays of Rydbergs and correlated emission in free space. Notably, our TWA approach outperforms the cumulant expansion method in certain models and performs comparably well in others, all while offering significantly lower computational costs and a much simpler formulation of the dynamical equations. We therefore argue that TWA could become in the near future a primary tool for a fast and efficient first exploration of driven-dissipative many-body dynamics on consumer grade computers.</description>

Abstract: Solid state quantum emitters, in particular group-IV vacancy centers in diamond, are at the forefront of research in quantum technologies due to their unique optical and spin properties. Reduction of the diamond host size to the nanoscale enables new opportunities in terms of integration and scalability. However, creating optically coherent quantum emitters in nanodiamonds remains a major challenge. Here, we present the fabrication of germanium- and tin- vacancy centers by means of ion implantation. We describe the fabrication process and present the optical properties of the created color centers. We achieve high purity single photon emission via resonant excitation and strong coherent drive of a SnV$^-$ center. The successful integration of heavier group-IV vacancy centers in nanodiamonds paves the way for further advances in fields like hybrid quantum photonics or sensing on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Entanglement detection with quantum support vector machine(QSVM) on near-term quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and quantifying quantum entanglement remain significant challenges in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. This study presents the implementation of quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) on IBM quantum devices to identify and classify entangled states. By employing quantum variational circuits, the proposed framework achieves a runtime complexity of $O(\frac{N t}{\epsilon^2})$, where $N$ is the number of qubits, $t$ is the number of iterations, and $\epsilon$ is the acceptable error margin. We investigate various quantum circuits with multiple blocks and obtain the accuracy of QSVM as measures of expressibility and entangling capability. Our results demonstrate that the QSVM framework achieves over 90\% accuracy in distinguishing entangled states, despite hardware noise such as decoherence and gate errors. Benchmarks across superconducting qubit platforms (e.g., IBM Perth, Lagos, and Nairobi) highlight the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the QSVM framework effectively classifies two-qubit states and extends its predictive capabilities to three-qubit entangled states. This work marks a significant advancement in quantum machine learning for entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>PHOENIX: Pauli-Based High-Level Optimization Engine for Instruction Execution on NISQ Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. PHOENIX employs the binary symplectic form (BSF) to formally describe Pauli strings and reformulates IR synthesis as reducing the column weights of BSF by appropriate Clifford transformations. It comes with a heuristic BSF simplification algorithm that searches for the most appropriate 2Q Clifford operators in sequence to maximally simplify the BSF at each step, until the BSF can be directly synthesized by basic 1Q and 2Q gates. PHOENIX further performs a global ordering strategy in a Tetris-like fashion for these simplified IR groups, carefully balancing optimization opportunities for gate cancellation, minimizing circuit depth, and managing qubit routing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in tabletop quantum sensor technology have enabled searches for nongravitational interactions of dark matter (DM). Traditional axion DM experiments rely on sharp resonance, resulting in extensive scanning time to cover a wide mass range. In this work, we present a broadband approach in an alkali-${}^{21}$Ne spin system. We identify two distinct hybrid spin-coupled regimes: a self-compensation (SC) regime at low frequencies and a hybrid spin resonance (HSR) regime at higher frequencies. By utilizing these two distinct regimes, we significantly enhance the bandwidth of ${}^{21}$Ne nuclear spin compared to conventional nuclear magnetic resonance, while maintaining competitive sensitivity. We present a comprehensive broadband search for axion-like dark matter, covering 5 orders of magnitude of Compton frequencies range within $[10^{-2}, \, 10^3]$ Hz. We set new constraints on the axion dark matter interactions with neutrons and protons, accounting for the effects of DM stochasticity. For the axion-neutron coupling, our results reach a low value of $|g_{ann}|\le 3\times 10^{-10}$ in the frequency range $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 4]$ Hz surpassing astrophysical limits and providing the strongest laboratory constraints in the $[10, \, 100]$ Hz range. For the axion-proton coupling, we offer the best terrestrial constraints for the frequency ranges $[2\times 10^{-2}, \, 5]$Hz and $[16, \, 7\times 10^{2}]$ Hz.</description>

Abstract: The fermionic von Neumann entropy, the fermionic entanglement entropy and the fermionic relative entropy are defined for causal fermion systems. Our definition makes use of entropy formulas for quasi-free fermionic states in terms of the reduced one-particle density operator. Our definitions are illustrated in various examples for Dirac spinors in two- and four-dimensional Minkowski space, in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry and for fermionic lattices. We review area laws for the two-dimensional diamond and a three-dimensional spatial region in Minkowski space. The connection is made to the computation of the relative entropy using modular theory.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of collective modes in a Bose-Einstein condensate: From single to double excitation periods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective modes are coherent excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), and their study provides insight into the macroscopic quantum phenomena that govern these systems. Collective mode frequencies can be used to probe the properties of BECs, such as the trap geometry, the interatomic interactions, and the presence of defects; hence, it is essential to develop methods for high-resolution determination of collective mode frequencies. A standard technique consists of a single pulse of an external oscillatory field, which we denote Rabi-like due to the analogy with the field of nuclear magnetic resonances. In this work, we propose a method to achieve a better resolution than the Rabi-like protocol, which consists of two oscillating fields separated in time, which we call Ramsey-like. We focus on BECs in harmonic traps, considering mainly the quadrupole and breathing modes for different trap anisotropy values and comparing the results using single and double excitation zones. First, we employ a variational approach with a Thomas-Fermi ansatz, which gives rise to dynamical equations that are numerically solved. Then, we modeled the problem as a three-level system, offering a concise and alternative description of the same dynamics, enabling the idea of coherent control of these collective modes. Both approaches show that the Ramsey-like protocol provides a better resolution than the Rabi-like. This offers the possibility of measuring collective mode frequencies with higher precision, which is important in experiments where they are used as indirect measurements of properties that are difficult to probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental control over the strength and angular dependence of interactions between atoms is a key capability for advancing quantum technologies. Here, we use microwave dressing to manipulate and enhance Rydberg-Rydberg interactions in an atomic ensemble. By varying the cloud length relative to the blockade radius and measuring the statistics of the light retrieved from the ensemble, we demonstrate a clear enhancement of the interaction strength due to microwave dressing. These results are successfully captured by a theoretical model that accounts for the excitation dynamics, atomic density distribution, and the phase-matched retrieval efficiency. Our approach offers a versatile platform for further engineering interactions by exploiting additional features of the microwave fields, such as polarization and detuning, opening pathways for new quantum control strategies.</description>

      <title>Measuring pair correlations in Bose and Fermi gases via atom-resolved microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate atom-resolved detection of itinerant bosonic $^{23}$Na and fermionic $^6$Li quantum gases, enabling the direct in situ measurement of interparticle correlations. In contrast to prior work on lattice-trapped gases, here we realize microscopy of quantum gases in the continuum. We reveal Bose-Einstein condensation with single-atom resolution, measure the enhancement of two-particle $g^{(2)}$ correlations of thermal bosons, and observe the suppression of $g^{(2)}$ for fermions; the Fermi or exchange hole. For strongly interacting Fermi gases confined to two dimensions, we directly observe non-local fermion pairs in the BEC-BCS crossover. We obtain the pairing gap, the pair size, and the short-range contact directly from the pair correlations. In situ thermometry is enabled via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our technique opens the door to the atom-resolved study of strongly correlated quantum gases of bosons, fermions, and their mixtures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.126601}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Random Matrix Theory in quantum chaotic systems: A Perspective from Observable Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study deviations from random matrix theory (RMT) in quantum chaotic systems from a perspective of observable properties. Specifically, we focus on the envelope function of the off-diagonal elements of few-body observables written in the eigenbasis of a quantum chaotic manybody system, as introduced in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz. Our objective is to understand the origin of the nontrivial structure of the envelope function in real systems and its connection to the distance of the system from a fully random system described by RMT. To this end, we introduce a method to systematically induce randomness into a real model, which eventually transitions into a random matrix model. Our numerical simulations of a defect Ising model show that the nontrivial structure of the envelope function of local spins becomes less pronounced as the randomness of the system increase, eventually disappearing when the system becomes fully random. Our results imply that the structure of the envelope function of few-body observables is closely related to the randomness of the system, which can be used to characterize the deviation from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States and Symmetry: A Group-Theoretic Approach to Gauge-Invariant Packaged Entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A packaged quantum state refers to a quantum state that includes an inseparable block of internal quantum numbers. These types of quantum states are the result of gauge invariance and superselection, and therefore have particular symmetric structures. Here we show that, in multiparticle quantum systems, any nontrivial representation of a finite or compact group inherently induces packaged entanglement that inseparably entangles every internal quantum number (IQN). 
In this theory, every single-particle excitation carries an inseparable IQN block controlled by the irreducible representation of the group. The local gauge constraints or superselection rules forbid the occurrence of any partial charges or partial IQN entanglement. We demonstrate this principle using various specific symmetries, such as gauge symmetries ($U(1)$, $SU(2)$, and $SU(3)$), discrete symmetries (charge conjugation $C$, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and their combinations), and $p$-form symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules ensure that the resulting quantum states cannot be factorized. We then used these ideas to explain phenomena like Bell-type structures, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations. The packaging principle connects concepts from gauge theory, topological classifications, and quantum information. These results may be useful for applications in exotic hadron spectroscopy, extended symmetries in quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which simplifies existing algorithms already for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining variational Monte Carlo, enabling efficient variational optimization for (2+1)D LGT ground states with gauge and matter fields. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate simulation of pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory, odd-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32\times 32$. Our work establishes gauge-invariant PEPS as a powerful approach to simulate (2+1)D Abelian LGTs.</description>

      <title>Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG with substantial circumference on cylindrical geometry for the first time in the literature. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Photon self-interaction through gravitons and axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to employ the concept of photon self-interaction for axion detection. In particular, we derive the interaction Hamiltonian for photons via axions in a ring cavity. We show that when the incoming photons are considered in plane-wave basis, the interaction vanishes. However, when the realistic case of photon wavepackets are assumed, a self-interaction whose strength is proportional to the size of the wavepacket and the cavity length exists. Under specific conditions, we find that the axion-mediated interaction dominates the gravitationally induced self-interaction. We discuss the implications of this setup for axion detection, focusing on the range of axion mass, $10^{-10}~\text{eV}&lt;m_a&lt;10^{-4}~\text{eV}$ for which the best accuracy of coupling constants is constrained in some cases to $g_{a\gamma \gamma}&gt; 9 \times 10^{-12}~ \text{GeV}^{-1}$.</description>
