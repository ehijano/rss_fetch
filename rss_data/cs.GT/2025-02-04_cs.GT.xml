      <title>Optimal Metric Distortion for Matching on the Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distortion of one-sided and two-sided matching problems on the line. In the one-sided case, $n$ agents need to be matched to $n$ items, and each agent's cost in a matching is their distance from the item they were matched to. We propose an algorithm that is provided only with ordinal information regarding the agents' preferences (each agent's ranking of the items from most- to least-preferred) and returns a matching aiming to minimize the social cost with respect to the agents' true (cardinal) costs. We prove that our algorithm simultaneously achieves the best-possible approximation of $3$ (known as distortion) with respect to a variety of social cost measures which include the utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. In the two-sided case, where the agents need be matched to $n$ other agents and both sides report their ordinal preferences over each other, we show that it is always possible to compute an optimal matching. In fact, we show that this optimal matching can be achieved using even less information, and we provide bounds regarding the sufficient number of queries.</description>

      <title>Fairshare Data Pricing for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training data is a pivotal resource for building large language models (LLMs), but unfair pricing in data markets poses a serious challenge for both data buyers (e.g., LLM builders) and sellers (e.g., human annotators), which discourages market participation, reducing data quantity and quality. In this paper, we propose a fairshare pricing framework that sets training data prices using data valuation methods to quantify their contribution to LLMs. In our framework, buyers make purchasing decisions using data valuation and sellers set prices to maximize their profits based on the anticipated buyer purchases. We theoretically show that pricing derived from our framework is tightly linked to data valuation and buyers' budget, optimal for both buyers and sellers. Through market simulations using current LLMs and datasets (math problems, medical diagnosis, and physical reasoning), we show that our framework is fairshare for buyers by ensuring their purchased data is reflective of model training value, leading to higher LLM task performances per-dollar spent on data, and fairshare for sellers by ensuring they sell their data at optimal prices. Our framework lays the foundation for future research on equitable and sustainable data markets for large-scale AI.</description>

      <title>Markovian Pandora's box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Markovian Pandora's Box Problem, where decisions are governed by both order constraints and Markovianly correlated rewards, structured within a shared directed acyclic graph. To the best of our knowledge, previous work has not incorporated Markovian dependencies in this setting. This framework is particularly relevant to applications such as data or computation driven algorithm design, where exploration of future models incurs cost.
  We present optimal fully adaptive strategies where the associated graph forms a forest. Under static transition, we introduce a strategy that achieves a near optimal expected payoff in multi line graphs and a 1/2 approximation in forest-structured graphs. Notably, this algorithm provides a significant speedup over the exact solution, with the improvement becoming more pronounced as the graph size increases. Our findings deepen the understanding of sequential exploration under Markovian correlations in graph-based decision-making.</description>

      <title>Strong Equilibria in Bayesian Games with Bounded Group Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the group strategic behaviors in Bayesian games. Equilibria in previous work do not consider group strategic behaviors with bounded sizes and are too ``strong'' to exist in many scenarios. We propose the ex-ante Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium and the Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium, where no group of at most $k$ agents can benefit from deviation. The two solution concepts differ in how agents calculate their utilities when contemplating whether a deviation is beneficial. Intuitively, agents are more conservative in the Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium than in the ex-ante Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium. With our solution concepts, we study collusion in the peer prediction mechanisms, as a representative of the Bayesian games with group strategic behaviors. We characterize the thresholds of the group size $k$ so that truthful reporting in the peer prediction mechanism is an equilibrium for each solution concept, respectively. Our solution concepts can serve as criteria to evaluate the robustness of a peer prediction mechanism against collusion. Besides the peer prediction problem, we also discuss two other potential applications of our new solution concepts, voting and Blotto games, where introducing bounded group sizes provides more fine-grained insights into the behavior of strategic agents.</description>

      <title>Distributive Fairness in Large Language Models: Evaluating Alignment with Human Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in employing large language models (LLMs) for decision-making in social and economic contexts has raised questions about their potential to function as agents in these domains. A significant number of societal problems involve the distribution of resources, where fairness, along with economic efficiency, play a critical role in the desirability of outcomes. In this paper, we examine whether LLM responses adhere to fundamental fairness concepts such as equitability, envy-freeness, and Rawlsian maximin, and investigate their alignment with human preferences. We evaluate the performance of several LLMs, providing a comparative benchmark of their ability to reflect these measures. Our results demonstrate a lack of alignment between current LLM responses and human distributional preferences. Moreover, LLMs are unable to utilize money as a transferable resource to mitigate inequality. Nonetheless, we demonstrate a stark contrast when (some) LLMs are tasked with selecting from a predefined menu of options rather than generating one. In addition, we analyze the robustness of LLM responses to variations in semantic factors (e.g. intentions or personas) or non-semantic prompting changes (e.g. templates or orderings). Finally, we highlight potential strategies aimed at enhancing the alignment of LLM behavior with well-established fairness concepts.</description>

      <title>Satisfactory Budget Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A divisible budget must be allocated to several projects, and agents are asked for their opinion on how much they would give to each project. We consider that an agent is satisfied by a division of the budget if, for at least a certain predefined number $\tau$ of projects, the part of the budget actually allocated to each project is at least as large as the amount the agent requested. The objective is to find a budget division that ``best satisfies'' the agents. In this context, different problems can be stated and we address the following ones. We study $(i)$ the largest proportion of agents that can be satisfied for any instance, $(ii)$ classes of instances admitting a budget division that satisfies all agents, $(iii)$ the complexity of deciding if, for a given instance, every agent can be satisfied, and finally $(iv)$ the question of finding, for a given instance, the smallest total budget to satisfy all agents. We provide answers to these complementary questions for several natural values of the parameter $\tau$, capturing scenarios where we seek to satisfy for each agent all; almost all; half; or at least one of her requests.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Solver for 2p0s Differential Games with One-Sided Payoff Information and Continuous Actions, States, and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing solvers for imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs) often struggle with scalability in terms of action and state space sizes and the number of time steps. However, many real-world games involve continuous action and state spaces and occur in continuous time, making them differential in nature. This paper addresses the scalability challenges for a representative class of two-player zero-sum (2p0s) differential games where the informed player knows the game type (payoff) while the uninformed one only has a prior belief over the set of possible types. Such games encompass a wide range of attack-defense scenarios, where the defender adapts based on their belief about the attacker's target. We make the following contributions: (1) We show that under the Isaacs' condition, the complexity of computing the Nash equilibrium for these games is not related to the action space size; and (2) we propose a multigrid approach to effectively reduce the cost of these games when many time steps are involved.

      <title>Networked Digital Public Goods Games with Heterogeneous Players and Convex Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital age, resources such as open-source software and publicly accessible databases form a crucial category of digital public goods, providing extensive benefits for Internet. This paper investigates networked public goods games involving heterogeneous players and convex costs, focusing on the characterization of Nash Equilibrium (NE). In these games, each player can choose her effort level, representing her contributions to public goods. Network structures are employed to model the interactions among participants. Each player's utility consists of a concave value component, influenced by the collective efforts of all players, and a convex cost component, determined solely by the individual's own effort. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the networked public goods game with convex costs.
  Our research begins by examining welfare solutions aimed at maximizing social welfare and ensuring the convergence of pseudo-gradient ascent dynamics. We establish the presence of NE in this model and provide an in-depth analysis of the conditions under which NE is unique. We also delve into comparative statics, an essential tool in economics, to evaluate how slight modifications in the model--interpreted as monetary redistribution--affect player utilities. In addition, we analyze a particular scenario with a predefined game structure, illustrating the practical relevance of our theoretical insights. Overall, our research enhances the broader understanding of strategic interactions and structural dynamics in networked public goods games, with significant implications for policy design in internet economic and social networks.</description>

      <title>The Battling Influencers Game: Nash Equilibria Structure of a Potential Game and Implications to Value Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When multiple influencers attempt to compete for a receiver's attention, their influencing strategies must account for the presence of one another. We introduce the Battling Influencers Game (BIG), a multi-player simultaneous-move general-sum game, to provide a game-theoretic characterization of this social phenomenon. We prove that BIG is a potential game, that it has either one or an infinite number of pure Nash equilibria (NEs), and these pure NEs can be found by convex optimization. Interestingly, we also prove that at any pure NE, all (except at most one) influencers must exaggerate their actions to the maximum extent. In other words, it is rational for the influencers to be non-truthful and extreme because they anticipate other influencers to cancel out part of their influence. We discuss the implications of BIG to value alignment.</description>

      <title>Can Reinforcement Learning Solve Asymmetric Combinatorial-Continuous Zero-Sum Games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been extensive studies on learning in zero-sum games, focusing on the analysis of the existence and algorithmic convergence of Nash equilibrium (NE). Existing studies mainly focus on symmetric games where the strategy spaces of the players are of the same type and size. For the few studies that do consider asymmetric games, they are mostly restricted to matrix games. In this paper, we define and study a new practical class of asymmetric games called two-player Asymmetric Combinatorial-Continuous zEro-Sum (ACCES) games, featuring a combinatorial action space for one player and an infinite compact space for the other. Such ACCES games have broad implications in the real world, particularly in combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) where one player optimizes a solution in a combinatorial space, and the opponent plays against it in an infinite (continuous) compact space (e.g., a nature player deciding epistemic parameters of the environmental model). Our first key contribution is to prove the existence of NE for two-player ACCES games, using the idea of essentially finite game approximation. Building on the theoretical insights and double oracle (DO)-based solutions to complex zero-sum games, our second contribution is to design the novel algorithm, Combinatorial Continuous DO (CCDO), to solve ACCES games, and prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Considering the NP-hardness of most COPs and recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL)-based solutions to COPs, our third contribution is to propose a practical algorithm to solve NE in the real world, CCDORL (based on CCDO), and provide the novel convergence analysis in the ACCES game. Experimental results across diverse instances of COPs demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our algorithms. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/wmd3i/CCDO-RL.</description>

      <title>Metric Distortion of Small-group Deliberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models for social choice where voters rank a set of choices (or alternatives) by deliberating in small groups of size at most $k$, and these outcomes are aggregated by a social choice rule to find the winning alternative. We ground these models in the metric distortion framework, where the voters and alternatives are embedded in a latent metric space, with closer alternative being more desirable for a voter. We posit that the outcome of a small-group interaction optimally uses the voters' collective knowledge of the metric, either deterministically or probabilistically.
  We characterize the distortion of our deliberation models for small $k$, showing that groups of size $k=3$ suffice to drive the distortion bound below the deterministic metric distortion lower bound of $3$, and groups of size $4$ suffice to break the randomized lower bound of $2.11$. We also show nearly tight asymptotic distortion bounds in the group size, showing that for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, achieving a distortion of $1+\epsilon$ needs group size that only depends on $1/\epsilon$, and not the number of alternatives. We obtain these results via formulating a basic optimization problem in small deviations of the sum of $i.i.d.$ random variables, which we solve to global optimality via non-convex optimization. The resulting bounds may be of independent interest in probability theory.</description>

      <title>Verbalized Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information design (ID) explores how a sender influence the optimal behavior of receivers to achieve specific objectives. While ID originates from everyday human communication, existing game-theoretic and machine learning methods often model information structures as numbers, which limits many applications to toy games. This work leverages LLMs and proposes a verbalized framework in Bayesian persuasion (BP), which extends classic BP to real-world games involving human dialogues for the first time. Specifically, we map the BP to a verbalized mediator-augmented extensive-form game, where LLMs instantiate the sender and receiver. To efficiently solve the verbalized game, we propose a generalized equilibrium-finding algorithm combining LLM and game solver. The algorithm is reinforced with techniques including verbalized commitment assumptions, verbalized obedience constraints, and information obfuscation. Numerical experiments in dialogue scenarios, such as recommendation letters, courtroom interactions, and law enforcement, validate that our framework can both reproduce theoretical results in classic BP and discover effective persuasion strategies in more complex natural language and multi-stage scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Optimal Bandit Learning in Stackelberg Games with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online learning in Stackelberg games with side information between a leader and a sequence of followers. In every round the leader observes contextual information and commits to a mixed strategy, after which the follower best-responds. We provide learning algorithms for the leader which achieve $O(T^{1/2})$ regret under bandit feedback, an improvement from the previously best-known rates of $O(T^{2/3})$. Our algorithms rely on a reduction to linear contextual bandits in the utility space: In each round, a linear contextual bandit algorithm recommends a utility vector, which our algorithm inverts to determine the leader's mixed strategy. We extend our algorithms to the setting in which the leader's utility function is unknown, and also apply it to the problems of bidding in second-price auctions with side information and online Bayesian persuasion with public and private states. Finally, we observe that our algorithms empirically outperform previous results on numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the assumptions of the ViSE model, we investigate the welfare and performance of a society consisting of one group (a ``party'') and individualists. In the case of Gaussian proposal generators, the expected capital gains can be expressed in standard functions. The relative effectiveness of individualistic and group strategies of agents, as well as the benefits of the entire society, depend on the level of cooperation, the voting threshold, and the favorability of the environment. We focus on the evolution of society in neutral environments caused by changing its structure and the voting rule in the interests of agents.</description>

      <title>Selective Response Strategies for GenAI</title>

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has significantly impacted human-based forums like Stack Overflow, which are essential for generating high-quality data. This creates a negative feedback loop, hindering the development of GenAI systems, which rely on such data to provide accurate responses. In this paper, we provide a possible remedy: A novel strategy we call selective response. Selective response implies that GenAI could strategically provide inaccurate (or conservative) responses to queries involving emerging topics and novel technologies, thereby driving users to use human-based forums like Stack Overflow. We show that selective response can potentially have a compounding effect on the data generation process, increasing both GenAI's revenue and user welfare in the long term. From an algorithmic perspective, we propose an approximately optimal approach to maximize GenAI's revenue under social welfare constraints. From a regulatory perspective, we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for selective response to improve welfare improvements.</description>

      <title>A Variational Inequality Approach to Independent Learning in Static Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competitive games involving thousands or even millions of players are prevalent in real-world contexts, such as transportation, communications, and computer networks. However, learning in these large-scale multi-agent environments presents a grand challenge, often referred to as the "curse of many agents". In this paper, we formalize and analyze the Static Mean-Field Game (SMFG) under both full and bandit feedback, offering a generic framework for modeling large population interactions while enabling independent learning.
  We first establish close connections between SMFG and variational inequality (VI), showing that SMFG can be framed as a VI problem in the infinite agent limit. Building on the VI perspective, we propose independent learning and exploration algorithms that efficiently converge to approximate Nash equilibria, when dealing with a finite number of agents. Theoretically, we provide explicit finite sample complexity guarantees for independent learning across various feedback models in repeated play scenarios, assuming (strongly-)monotone payoffs. Numerically, we validate our results through both simulations and real-world applications in city traffic and network access management.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Games With Finitely Many Players: Independent Learning and Subjectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Independent learners are agents that employ single-agent algorithms in multi-agent systems, intentionally ignoring the effect of other strategic agents. This paper studies mean-field games from a decentralized learning perspective, with two primary objectives: (i) to identify structure that can guide algorithm design, and (ii) to understand the emergent behaviour in systems of independent learners. We study a new model of partially observed mean-field games with finitely many players, local action observability, and a general observation channel for partial observations of the global state. Specific observation channels considered include (a) global observability, (b) local and mean-field observability, (c) local and compressed mean-field observability, and (d) only local observability. We establish conditions under which the control problem of a given agent is equivalent to a fully observed MDP, as well as conditions under which the control problem is equivalent only to a POMDP. Building on the connection to MDPs, we prove the existence of perfect equilibrium among memoryless stationary policies under mean-field observability. Leveraging the connection to POMDPs, we prove convergence of learning iterates obtained by independent learning agents under any of the aforementioned observation channels. We interpret the limiting values as subjective value functions, which an agent believes to be relevant to its control problem. These subjective value functions are then used to propose subjective Q-equilibrium, a new solution concept for partially observed n-player mean-field games, whose existence is proved under mean-field or global observability. We provide a decentralized learning algorithm for partially observed n-player mean-field games, and we show that it drives play to subjective Q-equilibrium by adapting the recently developed theory of satisficing paths to allow for subjectivity.</description>

      <title>Contract Design for V2G Smart Energy Trading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to a net zero energy system necessitates development in a number of directions including developing advanced electricity trading markets. Due to electricity markets being responsible for a large portion of carbon emissions, improving the electricity markets' method for determining energy transactions could have a significant impact on carbon reductions and thus facilitate this transition. V2X technology can be applied to regulate different energy markets, and thus reduce costs and carbon emissions by using the batteries in electric vehicles to store energy during off-peak hours and export it during peak hours.
  We develop a novel contract based on the VCG-mechanism, for exporting and importing electricity effectively, and show how this mechanism can raise efficiency, facilitate the development of a sustainable and efficient electricity market, and bring us nearer to our Net Zero Goal.</description>

      <title>Replication-proof Bandit Mechanism Design with Bayesian Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of designing replication-proof bandit mechanisms when agents strategically register or replicate their own arms to maximize their payoff. Specifically, we consider Bayesian agents who only know the distribution from which their own arms' mean rewards are sampled, unlike the original setting of by Shin et al. 2022. Interestingly, with Bayesian agents in stark contrast to the previous work, analyzing the replication-proofness of an algorithm becomes significantly complicated even in a single-agent setting. We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for an algorithm to be replication-proof in the single-agent setting, and present an algorithm that satisfies these properties. These results center around several analytical theorems that focus on \emph{comparing the expected regret of multiple bandit instances}, and therefore might be of independent interest since they have not been studied before to the best of our knowledge. We expand this result to the multi-agent setting, and provide a replication-proof algorithm for any problem instance. We finalize our result by proving its sublinear regret upper bound which matches that of Shin et al. 2022.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries of Service: Interdependence and Synchronicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On many dimensions, services can be seen to exist along spectra measuring the degree of interaction between customer and agent. For instance, every interaction features some number of contributions by each of those two sides, creating a spectrum of interdependence. Additionally, each interaction is further characterized by the relative pacing of these contributions, implying a spectrum of synchronicity. Where a service falls on such spectra can be a consequence of its design, but it can also be a function of its state. For instance, as broadly evidenced empirically, an agent with several concurrent interactions will be slowed in each individual interaction, altering the service's synchronicity. Here, we study a Hawkes cluster model of the service interaction, which we show captures the interdependence and synchronicity spectra and their resulting customer-agent (a)symmetries. We find insightful connections to behavioral operations, such as proving the occurrence of non-monotonic performance (e.g., inverted-U throughput) from concurrency-driven asynchrony. Hence, we can prescribe the agent's optimal concurrency level. Furthermore, we show how the service design dictates the efficacy of these operational improvements, proving that the concurrency-optimized throughput is itself non-monotonic as a function of the interdependence. Of possible independent interest methodologically, we establish an interpretable temporal decomposition for Hawkes clusters.</description>

      <title>Free-Rider and Conflict Aware Collaboration Formation for Cross-Silo Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple FL participants (FL-PTs) to collaborate on training models without sharing private data. Due to data heterogeneity, negative transfer may occur in the FL training process. This necessitates FL-PT selection based on their data complementarity. In cross-silo FL, organizations that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest, and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors. To this end, we propose an optimal FL collaboration formation strategy -- FedEgoists -- which ensures that: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from FL if and only if it benefits the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors or their supporters. It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgoists compared to nine state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.</description>

      <title>Prices, Bids, Values: One ML-Powered Combinatorial Auction to Rule Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs). The main challenge in this domain is that the bundle space grows exponentially in the number of items. To address this, recent work has proposed machine learning (ML)-based preference elicitation algorithms that aim to elicit only the most critical information from bidders to maximize efficiency. However, while the SOTA ML-based algorithms elicit bidders' preferences via value queries, ICAs that are used in practice elicit information via demand queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel ML algorithm that provably makes use of the full information from both value and demand queries, and we show via experiments that combining both query types results in significantly better learning performance in practice. Building on these insights, we present MLHCA, a new ML-powered auction that uses value and demand queries. MLHCA substantially outperforms the previous SOTA, reducing efficiency loss by up to a factor 10, with up to 58% fewer queries. Thus, MLHCA achieves large efficiency improvements while also reducing bidders' cognitive load, establishing a new benchmark for both practicability and efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the Tractability Landscape of the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the Conditional Approval Framework for elections involving multiple interdependent issues, specifically focusing on the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of this rule, demonstrating that no approach can significantly outperform the brute-force algorithm under common computational complexity assumptions and various natural input restrictions. In response, we propose two practical restrictions (the first in the literature) that make the problem computationally tractable and show that these restrictions are essentially tight. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the tractability landscape of the problem, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the complications introduced by conditional ballots and indicating that conditional approval voting can be applied in practice, albeit under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the content verification process is essential to maintaining the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for (rational) verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could incentivize lazy reporting and undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment renders it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly without additional layers of procedures, e.g., reputation systems or additional committee voting.
  In this paper, we initiate the research with the development of a Byzantine-robust peer prediction framework towards the design of one-phase Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification games among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. Furthermore, we optimize our mechanism to realize provable robustness against collusions and other malicious behavior from the verifiers, and also show its resilience to inaccurate priors and beliefs. With the theoretically guaranteed robust incentive properties of our mechanism, our study provides a framework of incentive design for decentralized verification protocols that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>

Abstract: We design mechanisms for maintaining public goods which require periodic in-kind contributions, motivated by incentives problems facing crowd-sourced recommender systems. Utilitarian welfare is maximized by redistributive policies which are infeasible when group members can leave or misreport their preferences. An optimal mechanism reduces contributions for group members with low benefit-cost ratios to encourage participation; and pairs reduced contributions with restricted access to the good to ensure truthful reporting. At most two membership tiers are offered at the optimum, indicating that ecommerce and digital content platforms may benefit substantially from offering simple user-adjustable recommendation settings.</description>

      <title>Thunderdome: Timelock-Free Rationally-Secure Virtual Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.
  At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately \$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about \$7 (0.004 ETH).</description>

Abstract: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. This would potentially transform search across human candidates, including for marriage and jobs -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun experimenting with training "AI clones" to represent users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones and their imperfect representation of humans. Individuals are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations. I compare two search regimes: an "in-person regime" -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an "AI representation regime" -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a higher expected match quality than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.</description>
