      <title>Accretion Flares from Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong tidal force in a supermassive black hole's (SMBH) vicinity, coupled with a higher stellar density at the center of a galaxy, make it an ideal location to study the interaction between stars and black holes. Two stars moving near the SMBH could collide at a very high speed, which can result in a high energy flare. The resulting debris can then accrete onto the SMBH, which could be observed as a separate event. We simulate the light curves resulting from the fallback accretion in the aftermath of a stellar collision near a SMBH. We investigate how it varies with physical parameters of the system. With all other physical parameters of the system held constant, the direction of the relative velocity vector at time of impact plays a large role in determining the overall form of the light curve. One distinctive light curve we notice is characterized by a sustained increase in the luminosity some time after accretion has started. We compare this form to the light curves of some candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs). Stellar collision accretion flares can take on unique appearances that would allow them to be easily distinguished, as well as elucidate underlying physical parameters of the system. There exist several ways to distinguish these events from TDEs, including the much wider range of SMBH masses stellar collisions may exist around.</description>

      <title>Cautionary tales on heating-rate prescriptions in kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major ingredient for kilonova lightcurves is the radioactive heating rate and its dependence on the electron fraction and velocity of the ejecta and, in principle, on the nuclear mass formula. Heating-rate formulae commonly used as the basis for kilonova models are, strictly speaking, incorrect for electron fractions other than $Y_{e} = 0.04$. Here, we introduce new semi-analytical models for kilonovae with better heating rate prescriptions valid for the full parameter space of kilonova velocities and electron fractions. This new prescription produces, on average, dimmer kilonovae at peak that decay more slowly as compared to previously used prescriptions for otherwise identical kilonova physics. We show the dangers of using inappropriate heating rate estimates by simulating realistic observations and inferring the kilonova parameters via a misspecified heating-rate prescription. While providing great fits to the photometry, an incorrect heating-rate prescription fails to recover the input ejecta masses at greater than $5\sigma$. This bias from an incorrect prescription has disastrous consequences for interpreting kilonovae, their use as additional components in gamma-ray burst afterglows, and understanding their role in cosmic chemical evolution or for multi-messenger constraints on the nuclear equation of state. Given the true heating-rate is uncertain, we estimate there is a $\approx 5$ and $\approx 10\%$ systematic uncertainty in the measured ejecta masses and velocities, respectively. For lanthanide-rich ejecta, the systematic uncertainty could be as high as $\approx 50\%$. This systematic uncertainty limits the precision of any measurements that rely on accurate estimates of kilonova ejecta properties.</description>

      <title>Proto-Neutron Star Convection and the Neutrino-Driven Wind: Implications for the $\nu$p-Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of the neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron stars have indicated that the wind is likely proton-rich for much of its lifetime, and the high flux of neutrinos can induce $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis allowing for the formation of heavy elements. It has also been shown that gravito-acoustic waves, generated by convection within the proto-neutron star, can significantly alter the dynamics and nucleosynthesis in the wind. Therefore, we present a study of the effects of convection-driven waves on the nucleosynthesis in proton-rich neutrino-driven winds, focusing on the $\nu$p-process. We find that wave effects can strongly impact $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis even at wave luminosities a factor of $10^{-5}$ smaller than the total neutrino luminosity. The momentum flux of the waves accelerates the wind, reducing the net neutrino heating and the persistent neutron abundance created by p($\bar{\nu}_e,e^+$), which impedes $\nu$p-process nucleosynthesis. However, this effect is generally counteracted by the effects of waves on seed nucleus formation, as the acceleration of the wind and the heating that occurs as these waves shock both favor a more $\alpha$-rich environment with very little heavy seed-nucleus formation. Overall, higher wave luminosities correlate (albeit non-monotonically) with heavier element $\nu$p-processing, up to $A\approx 200$ in some cases. At very high wave luminosities ($\gtrsim 10^{-3}L_\nu$), early shock heating by the waves disrupts $\alpha$ recombination, and drives a suppressed, fast-outflow r-process proceeding up to $A\approx 200$. This occurs despite an assumed neutrino spectrum that predicts a proton-rich wind with equilibrium $Y_e=0.6$.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Spectra from Particle-in-cell Simulations of Relativistic Jets containing an initial Toroidal Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of relativistic jets, their interaction with the environment, and their emission of radiation can be self-consistently studied by using particle-in-cell (PIC) numerical simulations. Using three-dimensional (3D), relativistic PIC simulations, we present the first self-consistently calculated synthetic spectra of head-on and off-axis emission from electrons accelerated in cylindrical, relativistic plasma jets containing an initial toroidal magnetic field. The jet particles are initially accelerated during the linear stage of growing plasma instabilities, which are the Weibel instability (WI), kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (kKHI), and mushroom instability (MI). In the nonlinear stage, these instabilities are dissipated and generate turbulent magnetic fields which accelerate particles further. We calculate the synthetic spectra by tracing a large number of jet electrons in the nonlinear stage, near the jet head where the magnetic fields are turbulent. Our results show the basic properties of jitter-like radiation emitted by relativistic electrons when they travel through a magnetized plasma with the plasma waves driven by kinetic instabilities (WI, kKHI, and MI) growing into the nonlinear regime. At low frequencies, the slope of the spectrum is ~ 0.94, which is similar to that of the jitter radiation. The results are relevant to active galactic nuclei/blazars and gamma-ray burst jet emission and set the ground for future studies on synthetic spectra from relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Stellar black holes can "stretch'' supermassive black hole accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar black holes (sBHs) are widely believed to exist in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Previous studies often focus on the transient emission produced by embedded sBHs. Here, we explore the possible observational consequences of an AGN accretion disk that contains a population of accreting sBHs. Embedded accreting sBHs change the effective temperature distribution of the AGN accretion disk by heating gas in the outer regions. Two possible observational consequences are presented. First, the spectral energy distribution has a turnover feature at $\sim 4700\ \textrm{\AA}$ when the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass is $\sim 10^8\ M_{\odot}$, which can help explain the observed shallow spectral shape at wavelengths $&gt;5000\ \textrm{\AA}$ for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar composite spectrum. Second, the half-light radius of a given relatively long wavelength is significantly larger than for an AGN disk without sBHs, which can be tested by microlensing observations. With appropriate sBH distributions, the model can be reconciled with quasar microlensing disk sizes. We propose that the half-light radius-wavelength relation can be utilized to investigate the distributions of embedded sBHs in AGN accretion disks.</description>

      <title>A Chandra Search for Periodic X-ray Sources in the Bulge of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for periodic X-ray sources in the bulge of M31, using ~ 2 Ms of archival Chandra observations spanning a temporal baseline of 16 years. Utilizing the Gregory-Loredo algorithm that is designed for photon-counting, phase-folded light curves, we detect seven periodic X-ray sources, among which five are newly discovered. Three of these sources are novae, the identified periods of which range between 1.3-2.0 hour and is most likely the orbital period. The other four sources are low-mass X-ray binaries, the identified periods of which range between 0.13-19.3 hour and are also likely orbital due to a clear eclipsing/dipping behavior in the light curve. We address implications on the X-ray binary population of the M31 bulge. Our study demonstrates the potential of using archival X-ray observations to systematically identify periodic X-ray sources in external galaxies, which would provide valuable information about the underlying exotic stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Supernova 1987A's keyhole: A long-lived jet-pair in the final explosion phase of core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I further study the manner by which a pair of opposite jets shape the `keyhole' morphological structure of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1997A, now the CCSN remnant (CCSNR) 1987A. By doing so, I strengthen the claim that the jittering-jet explosion mechanism (JJEM) accounts for most, likely all, CCSNe. The `keyhole' structure comprises a northern low-intensity zone closed with a bright rim on its front and an elongated low-intensity nozzle in the south. This rim-nozzle asymmetry is observed in some cooling flow clusters and planetary nebulae that are observed to be shaped by jets. I build a toy model that uses the planar jittering jets pattern, where consecutive pairs of jets tend to jitter in a common plane, implying that the accreted gas onto the newly born neutron star at the late explosion phase flows perpendicular to that plane. This allows for a long-lived jet-launching episode. This long-lasting jet-launching episode launches more mass into the jets that can inflate larger pairs of ears or bubbles, forming the main jets' axis of the CCSNR that is not necessarily related to a possible pre-collapse core rotation. I discuss the relation of the main jets' axis to the neutron star's natal kick velocity.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarimetric features of Gamma-ray Bursts across varied redshifts and hints for Axion-Like-Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric features during the prompt phase of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) have been essential for elucidating the debated emission mechanisms and gaining insight into the inner structure of GRBs. However, the potential impact of photon-Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) mixing in extragalactic magnetic fields, leading to significant modifications to the initial polarization state, has been overlooked in discussions concerning prompt phase constraints. In this work, we first examine the statistical characteristics of linear polarization degree ($\Pi_{L}$) in GRBs, by utilizing data from polarimetric missions focusing on sub-MeV emissions. Our analysis, conducted with a restricted sample of GRBs spanning various redshifts, reveals a diverse distribution of $\Pi_{L}$, which currently shows no correlation with the GRBs' spectral parameters or properties of candidate host galaxies. We then explore alternations to the initial $\Pi_{L}$ due to photon-ALP mixing within a domain-like structure of the intergalactic magnetic field (${\bf B}_{\rm IGM} $). With the existence of ALPs with $m_{a}$$~$$\lesssim$$~$$10^{-14}$$~$eV and $g_{a\gamma}~$$\simeq$$~0.5\times10^{-11}$, the mixing leads to a decrease in the polarization degree of initially fully linearly polarized photons, while it induces a certain degree of polarization to initially unpolarized photons. To ensure that the effect of mixing is small enough to be negligible, the mixing term $\Delta_{a\gamma} \equiv 1/2\ g_{a\gamma} {\bf B}_{\rm IGM}$ should be less than $1.5\times 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Currently, the number of GRBs with both sub-MeV polarization measurement and redshift confirmation remains very limited. Certification of redshift for GRBs with low $\Pi_{L}$ would further constrain the parameter space of ALPs or provide an independent means to determine the upper limit on ${\bf B}_{\rm IGM}$.</description>

      <title>A Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Survey of Radio-loud Broad Absorption Line Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A substantial fraction of quasars display broad absorption lines (BALs) in their rest-frame ultraviolet spectra. While the origin of BALs is thought to be related to the accretion disc wind, it remains unclear whether the observed ratio of BAL to non-BAL quasars is due to orientation. We conducted observations of 48 BAL quasars and the same number of non-BAL quasars at 322 MHz using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. Combined with previous flux measurements ranging from MHz to GHz frequencies, we compared continuum radio spectra between the two quasar groups. These data offer insights into low-frequency radio properties that have been difficult to investigate with previous observations only at GHz frequencies. Our results present that $73\pm13$ per cent of the BAL quasars exhibit steep or peaked spectra, a higher proportion than $44 \pm 14$ per cent observed in the non-BAL quasars. In contrast, there are no discernible differences between the two quasar groups in the radio luminosity, peak frequency, and spectral index distributions of sources with steep or peaked spectra and sources with flat or inverted spectra. Generally, as the jet axis and line of sight become closer to parallel, quasars exhibit flat or inverted spectra rather than steep or peaked ones. Therefore, these results suggest that BAL quasars are more frequently observed farther from the jet axis than non-BAL quasars. However, given that a certain proportion of BAL quasars exhibit flat or inverted spectra, more than the simple orientation scenario is required to elucidate the radio properties of BAL quasars.</description>

      <title>Supernova remnants of red supergiants: from barrels to Cygnus loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernova remnants are the nebular leftover of defunct massive stars which have died during a supernova explosion, mostly while undergoing the red supergiant phase of their evolution. The morphology and emission properties of those remnants are a function of the distribution of circumstellar material at the moment of the supernova, the intrisic properties of the explosion, as well as those of the ambient medium. By means of 2.5 dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we model the long term evolution of supernova remnants generated by runaway rotating massive stars moving into a magnetised interstellar medium. Radiative transfer calculations reveal that the projected non-thermal emission of the supernova remnants decreases with time, i.e. older remnants are fainter than younger ones. Older (80 kyr) supernova remnants whose progenitors were moving with space velocity corresponding to a Mach number M = 1 (v_star = 20 km/s ) in the Galactic plane of the ISM (nISM = 1/cm3 ) are brighter in synchrotron than when moving with a Mach number M = 2 (v_star = 40 km/s ). We show that runaway red supergiant progenitors first induce an asymmetric non thermal 1.4 GHz barrel like synchrotron supernova remnants (at the age of about 8 kyr), before further evolving to adopt a Cygnus loop like shape (at about 80 kyr). It is conjectured that a significative fraction of supernova remnants are currently in this bilateral-to-Cygnus-loop evolutionary sequence, and that this should be taken into account in the data interpretation of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) observatory.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of High-frequency Whistler Waves at Earth's Bow Shock: Further Support for Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We statistically investigate high-frequency whistler waves (with frequencies higher than $\sim 10$ % of the local elect ron cyclotron frequency) at Earth's bow shock using Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) spacecraft observations. We focus specifically on the wave power within the shock transition layer, where we expect electron acceleration via stochastic sh ock drift acceleration (SSDA) to occur associated with efficient pitch-angle scattering by whistler waves. We find that the wave power is positively correlated with both the Alfv\'en Mach number in the normal incidence frame $M_{\rm A}$ and in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame $M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn}$. The empirical relation with $M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn}$ is compared with the theory of SSDA that predicts a threshold wave power proportional to $(M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn})^{-2}$. The result suggests that the wave power exceeds the theoretical threshold for $M_{\rm A} / \cos \theta_{Bn} \gtrsim 30-60$, beyond which efficient electron acceleration is expected. This aligns very well with previous statistical analysis of electron acceleration at Earth's bow shock (M. Oka, G eophys.~Res.~Lett., 33, 5, 2006). Therefore, we consider that this study provides further support for SSDA as the mechanism of electron acceleration at Earth's bow shock. At higher-Mach-number astrophysical shocks, SSDA will be able to inject electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process for subsequent acceleration to cosmic-ray energies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN~1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>X-ray imaging and electron temperature evolution in laser-driven magnetic reconnection experiments at the National Ignition Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from X-ray imaging of high-aspect-ratio magnetic reconnection experiments driven at the National Ignition Facility. Two parallel, self-magnetized, elongated laser-driven plumes are produced by tiling 40 laser beams. A magnetic reconnection layer is formed by the collision of the plumes. A gated X-ray framing pinhole camera with micro-channel plate (MCP) detector produces multiple images through various filters of the formation and evolution of both the plumes and current sheet. As the diagnostic integrates plasma self-emission along the line of sight, 2-dimensional electron temperature maps $\langle T_e \rangle_Y$ are constructed by taking the ratio of intensity of these images obtained with different filters. The plumes have a characteristic temperature $\langle T_e \rangle_Y = 240 \pm 20$ eV at 2 ns after the initial laser irradiation and exhibit a slow cooling up to 4 ns. The reconnection layer forms at 3 ns with a temperature $\langle T_e \rangle_Y = 280 \pm 50$ eV as the result of the collision of the plumes. The error bars of the plumes and current sheet temperatures separate at $4$ ns, showing the heating of the current sheet from colder inflows. Using a semi-analytical model, we find that the observed heating of the current sheet is consistent with being produced by electron-ion drag, rather than the conversion of magnetic to kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Approaches to photon absorption in a Lorentz invariance violation scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Insights from PSR J0437-4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vector and isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars, while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic model that does not include a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of neutron-star properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.15$ km radius in the posterior of the neutron-star mass-radius relationship.</description>

      <title>The metallicity dependence and evolutionary times of merging binary black holes: Combined constraints from individual gravitational-wave detections and the stochastic background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy is now allowing for the study of compact binary merger demographics throughout the Universe. This information can be leveraged as tools for understanding massive stars, their environments, and their evolution. One active question is the nature of compact binary formation: the environmental and chemical conditions required for black hole birth and the time delays experienced by binaries before they merge. Gravitational-wave events detected today, however, primarily occur at low or moderate redshifts due to current interferometer sensitivity, therefore limiting our ability to probe the high redshift behavior of these quantities. In this work, we circumvent this limitation by using an additional source of information: observational limits on the gravitational-wave background from unresolved binaries in the distant Universe. Using current gravitational-wave data from the first three observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, we combine catalogs of directly detected binaries and limits on the stochastic background to constrain the time-delay distribution and metallicity dependence of binary black hole evolution. Looking to the future, we also explore how these constraints will be improved at the Advanced LIGO A+ sensitivity. We conclude that, although binary black hole formation cannot be strongly constrained with today's data, the future detection (or a non-detection) of the gravitational-wave background with Advanced LIGO A+ will carry strong implications for the evolution of binary black holes.</description>

      <title>XMM-Newton --NuSTAR monitoring campaign of the Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a joint {\it XMM-Newton} and {\it NuSTAR} campaign on the active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 4329A, consisting of 9 $\times$ 20 ks {\it XMM-Newton} observations, and 5 $\times$ 20 ks {\it NuSTAR} observations within nine days, performed in August 2021. Within each observation, the AGN is not very variable, with the fractional variability never exceeding 5%. Flux variations are observed between the different observations, on timescales of days, with a 30% ratio between the minimum and the maximum 2-10 keV flux. These variations follow the softer-when-brighter behavior typically observed in AGN. In all observations, a soft excess is clearly present. Consistently with previous observations, the X-ray spectra of the source exhibit a cut-off energy between 140 and 250 keV, constant within the error in the different observations. We detected a prominent component of the $6.4$\,keV Fe~K$\alpha$ line consistent with being constant during the monitoring, consisting of an unresolved narrow core and a broader component likely originating in the inner accredion disc. We find that the reflection component is weak ($R_{\rm max}=0.009\pm0.002$) and most likely originating in distant neutral medium. We also found the presence of a warm absorber component together with an ultra-fast outflow. Looking at their energetic, these outflows have enough mechanical power to exercise a significant feedback impact on the AGN surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way using binary neutron star merger observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether BNS mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here we demonstrate that a BNS population model informed by multimessenger neutron star observations predicts a merger rate and per-event r-process element yield consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints. If BNS mergers are to explain the r-process enrichment of stars in the Galaxy, we further show using a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model that they have to merge shortly after the formation of their progenitors, with a delay time distribution of power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90% confidence.Such short delay times are in tension with those predicted by standard BNS formation models and those observationally inferred from samples of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, we find that a two-channel enrichment scenario, where the second channel follows the star formation history, can account for both Galactic stellar and sGRB observations. Our results suggest that 45-90% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with significant delay times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a multi-frequency analysis of the gamma-ray bright blazar 1308+326 from February 2013 to March 2020, using the Korean VLBI Network at 22 and 43 GHz and gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our findings reveal spectral variations around the 2014 gamma-ray flare, aligning with the shock-in-jet model. A strong correlation is observed between gamma-ray and 43 GHz emissions, with a 27-day lag in the VLBI core light curve, indicating a 50-day delay from the beginning of a specific radio flare to the gamma-ray peak. This radio flare correlates with a new jet component, suggesting the 2014 gamma-ray flare resulted from its interaction with a stationary component. Our analysis indicates the 2014 gamma-ray flare originated 40-63 parsecs from the central engine, with seed photons for the gamma-ray emission unlikely from the broad-line region.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Distribution of Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superposition of many astrophysical gravitational wave (GW) signals below typical detection thresholds baths detectors in a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we present a Fourier space approach to compute the frequency-domain distribution of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by discrete sources. Expressions for the moment-generating function and the distribution of observed (discrete) Fourier modes are provided. The results are first applied to the signal originating from all the mergers of compact stellar remnants (black holes and neutron stars) in the Universe, which is found to exhibit a $-4$ power-law tail. This tail is verified in the signal-to-noise ratio distribution of GWTC events. The extent to which the subtraction of bright (loud) mergers gaussianizes the resulting confusion noise of unresolved sources is then illustrated. The power-law asymptotic tail for the unsubtracted signal, and an exponentially decaying tail in the case of the SGWB, are also derived analytically. Our results generalize to any background of gravitational waves emanating from discrete, individually coherent, sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady spherically symmetric accretion in the combined potential of a central black hole and a dark matter halo. For the halo, we consider a Hernquist and an NFW potential and calculate the critical points of the flow. We find that the trans-sonic solution to the centre is not possible without a black hole, whereas two types of trans-sonic solutions are possible in its presence. We also derive the mass accretion rate for a black hole at the centre of a dark matter halo. Our results indicate two phases of accretion. The first is an initial phase with a low accretion rate that depends on the black hole mass, followed by a second phase with a high accretion rate that depends on the halo mass. In the second phase, the black hole mass increases rapidly to supermassive scales, which explains the existence of quasars at redshift $z\ge 6$ and also the recently detected supermassive black holes (SMBHs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Further, we calculate the evolution of the Eddington ratio for growing black holes. The accretion is mostly sub-Eddington except for a short super-Eddington episode when the mass accretion rate transitions from low to high. However, during that episode, the black hole mass is likely inadequate to hinder accretion through radiative feedback.</description>

      <title>Characterization and performance of an upgraded front-end-board for NectarCAM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the updated version of the Front-End Board (FEB) for the NectarCAM camera, developed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The FEB is a critical component responsible for reading and converting signals from the camera's photo-multiplier tubes into digital data and generating module-level trigger signals. This study provides an overview of the design and performance of the new FEB version, including the use of an improved NECTAr3 chip with advanced features. The NECTAr3 chip contains a switched capacitor array for sampling signals at 1 GHz and a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for digitization upon receiving a trigger signal. The integration of the new NECTAr3 chip results in a significant reduction of NectarCAM's deadtime by an order of magnitude compared to the previous version. The paper also presents the results of laboratory testing, including measurements of timing performance, linearity, dynamic range, and deadtime, to characterize the new FEB's performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics beyond General Relativity can modify image features of black holes and horizonless spacetimes and increase the separation between photon rings. This motivates us to explore synthetic images consisting of two thin rings. Our synthetic images are parameterized by the separation as well as the relative flux density of the two rings. We perform fits to the visibility amplitude and analyze closure quantities. The current Event Horizon Telescope array cannot detect the presence of a second ring in the region of parameters motivated by particular new-physics cases. We show that this can be improved in three ways: first, if the array is upgraded with Earth-based telescopes with sufficiently high sensitivity, second, if the array is upgraded with a space-based station and third, if super-resolution techniques are used for the data obtained by the array.</description>

      <title>Time-lapse Very Long Baseline Interferometry Imaging of the Close Active Binary HR 1099</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report multiepoch astrometric very long baseline interferometry observations of the chromospherically active binary HR 1099 (V711 Tau, HD 22468) at six epochs over 63 days using the Very Long Baseline Array at 22.2 GHz. We determined hourly radio positions at each epoch with a positional uncertainty significantly smaller than the component separation. The aggregate radio positions at all epochs define an ellipse in the comoving reference frame with an inclination = $39.5^{+3.6}_{-3.5}\deg$ and longitude of ascending node $\Omega = 212\deg \pm 22\deg$. The ellipse center is offset from the Third Gaia Celestial Reference Frame position by $\Delta \alpha = -0.81^{+0.37}_{-0.25}$, $\Delta \delta = 0.45^{+0.25}_{-0.23}$ mas. All radio centroids are well displaced from the binary center of mass at all epochs, ruling out emission from the interbinary region. We examined the motion of the radio centroids within each epoch by comparing hourly positions over several hours. The measured speeds were not statistically significant for five of the six epochs, with $2\sigma$ upper limits in the range 200-1000 km/sec. However, for one flaring epoch, there was a $3\sigma$ detection $v_{\perp} = 228 \pm 85$ km/sec. This speed is comparable to the mean speed of observed coronal mass ejections on the Sun.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Hole Winds in X-rays -- SUBWAYS. III. A population study on ultra-fast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of blue-shifted absorption lines likely associated with ionized Iron K-shell transitions in the X-ray spectra of many Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) suggests the presence of a highly ionized gas outflowing with mildly relativistic velocities (0.03c-0.6c), named Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO). Within the SUBWAYS project we characterized these winds starting from a sample of 22 radio-quiet quasars at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.4, and compared the results with similar studies in the literature on samples of 42 local radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies and 14 high redshift radio-quiet quasars. The scope of our work is a statistical study of UFO parameters and incidence, considering key physical properties of the sources, e.g. supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rates and Spectral Energy Distribution, with the aim of gaining new insights into the UFO launching mechanisms. We find indications that highly luminous AGN with steeper X-ray/UV ratio, are more likely to host UFO. The presence of UFO is not significantly related to any other AGN property in our sample. These findings suggest that the UFO phenomenon may be transient. Focusing on AGN with UFO, other important results are: (1) faster UFO have larger ionization parameters and column densities; (2) X-ray radiation plays a more crucial role in driving highly ionized winds compared to UV; (3) the correlation between outflow velocity and luminosity is significantly flatter than what expected for radiatively driven winds; (4) more massive BH experience higher wind mass-losses, suppressing accretion of matter onto the BH; (5) the UFO launching radius is positively correlated with the Eddington ratio. Furthermore, our analysis suggest the involvement of multiple launching mechanisms, including radiation pressure and magneto-hydrodynamic processes, rather than pointing to a single, universally applicable mechanism.</description>
