      <title>Jordan-Segmentable Masks: A Topology-Aware definition for characterizing Binary Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\beta_0 = \beta_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.</description>

      <title>Higher Lie theory in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to develop integration theory for absolute partition $L_\infty$-algebras, which are point-set models for the (spectral) partition Lie algebras of Brantner-Mathew where infinite sums of operations are well-defined by definition. We construct a Quillen adjunction between absolute partition $L_\infty$-algebras and simplicial sets, and show that the right adjoint is a well-behaved integration functor. Points in this simplicial set are given by solutions to a Maurer-Cartan equation, and we give explicit formulas for gauge equivalences between them. We construct the analogue of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in this setting and show it produces an isomorphic group to the classical one over a characteristic zero field.
  We apply these constructions to show that absolute partition $L_\infty$-algebras encode the $p$-adic homotopy types of pointed connected finite nilpotent spaces, up to certain equivalences which we describe by explicit formulas. In particular, these formulas also allow us to give a combinatorial description of the homotopy groups of the $p$-completed spheres as solutions to a certain equation in a given degree, up to an equivalence relation imposed by elements one degree above. Finally, we construct absolute partition $L_\infty$ models for $p$-adic mapping spaces, which combined with the description of the homotopy groups gives an algebraic description of the homotopy type of these $p$-adic mapping spaces parallel to the unstable Adams spectral sequence.</description>

      <title>The cohomology of $BPU(p^m)$ and invariant polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. For a compact Lie group $G$ and an elementary abelian $p$-group $A$ of $G$, one may define the Weyl group $W_A$ of $A$ in a similar fashion as defining the Weyl group of a maximal torus, such that $W_A$ acts on $H^*(BA;R)$ for any coefficient ring $R$, and the image of the restriction $H^*(BG;R)\to H^*(BA;R)$ lies in $H^*(BA;R)^{W_A}$, the sub-algebra of $H^*(BA:R)$ of $W_A$-invariant elements.
  In this paper, we consider the projective unitary group $PU(p^m)$ and one of its maximal elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $A_m$, of which the Weyl group is isomorphic to $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Then the theory of $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$-invariant polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ may be applied to study the cohomology of $BPU(p^m)$, the classifying space of $PU(p^m)$. Following a theorem by Quillen, we deduce several theorems on $H^*(BPU(p^m);\mathbb{F}_p)$ modulo the nilradical from results on invariant polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit methods of proof of the Adams Conjecture in order to correct and supplement earlier efforts to prove analogous conjectures in the stable homotopy category. We utilize simplicial schemes over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and a rigid version of Artin-Mazur \'etale homotopy theory. Consideration of special $\mathcal F$-spaces and together with Bousfield-Kan $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completion enables us to employ an "\'etale functor" which commutes up to homotopy with products of simplicial schemes. In order to prove the Stable Adams Conjecture, we construct the universal $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibrations for various pointed simplicial sets $X$. Thus, two maps from a given $\mathcal F$-space $\underline{\mathcal B}$ to the base $\mathcal F$-space of the universal $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibration $\pi_{X,\ell}: \underline {\mathcal B} (G_\ell(X),X_\ell) \to \underline {\mathcal B} G_\ell(X)$ determine homotopy equivalent maps of spectra if and only they correspond via pull-back of $\pi_{X,\ell}$ to fiber homotopy equivalent $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibrations over $\underline {\mathcal B}$. For the proof of the Stable Adams Conjecture, we consider maps of $\mathcal F$-spaces $\underline {\mathcal B }\to \underline {\mathcal B} G_\ell(S^2)$ where $\underline {\mathcal B}$ is an $\mathcal F$-space model of connective $\ell$-completed connective $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology via Ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in topological data analysis. An initial step in its use involves constructing a nested sequence of simplicial complexes. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with \v{C}ech, Rips, alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a novel type of geometrically informed simplicial complex, called a Rips-type ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points, as used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present an algorithm for computing Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on Rips-type ellipsoid complexes. Additionally, we show that the ellipsoid barcodes depend continuously on the input data so that small perturbations of a k-generic point cloud lead to proportionally small changes in the resulting ellipsoid barcodes. This provides a theoretical guarantee analogous, if somewhat weaker, to the classical stability results for Rips and \v{C}ech filtrations. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that Rips-type ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating the homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to ground-truth topological features are longer compared to those obtained using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that Rips-type ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>The rational homotopy groups of virtual spheres for rank 1 compact Lie groups</title>

Abstract: We calculate the rational representation-ring-graded stable stems for rank 1 groups, SU(2), SO(3), Pin (2), O(2), Spin(2) and
  SO(2), in the same spirit as the calculations for finite groups in arXiv:2205.02382 with J.D.Quigley. This illustrates the effectiveness
  of the algebraic models for these categories of G-spectra, and the way tom Dieck splitting fails for desuspensions.

      <title>Steenrod Lengths and a Problem of Vakil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit combinatorial description of the function $f(n)$ governing the Steenrod length of real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$. This function arises in stable homotopy theory through the action of Steenrod squares on mod-$2$ cohomology and is closely related to the ghost length, which measures the minimal number of spheres required to construct a space up to homotopy. Building on the directed graphs $T_n$ introduced by Vakil to encode degree constraints for Steenrod operations, we interpret $f(n)$ as the length of the longest directed path starting at $n$. Using this framework, we resolve a question posed by Vakil by deriving concrete combinatorial formulas for $f(n)$ in terms of binary classes and a distinguished family of integers, which we call Vakil numbers.</description>

      <title>Directed univalence in simplicial homotopy type theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory with a directed path type which internalizes the notion of a homomorphism within a type. This concept has significant applications both within mathematics -- where it allows for synthetic (higher) category theory -- and programming languages -- where it leads to a directed version of the structure identity principle. In this work, we construct the first types in simplicial type theory with non-trivial homomorphisms. We extend simplicial type theory with modalities and new reasoning principles to obtain triangulated type theory in order to construct the universe of discrete types $\mathcal{S}$. We prove that homomorphisms in this type correspond to ordinary functions of types i.e., that $\mathcal{S}$ is directed univalent. The construction of $\mathcal{S}$ is foundational for both of the aforementioned applications of simplicial type theory. We are able to define several crucial examples of categories and to recover important results from category theory. Using $\mathcal{S}$, we are also able to define various types whose usage is guaranteed to be functorial. These provide the first complete examples of the proposed directed structure identity principle.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative categories is equivalent to that of monoidal $\infty$-categories, and likewise in the symmetric monoidal setting. As an application, we give a concise and complete proof of the fact that every presentably monoidal or presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category is presented by a monoidal or symmetric monoidal model category, which, in the monoidal case, was sketched by Lurie, and in the symmetric monoidal case, was proved by Nikolaus--Sagave.</description>

      <title>Morse sequences on stacks and flooding sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the framework of \emph{Morse sequences}, a simple and effective approach to discrete Morse theory. A Morse sequence on a simplicial complex consists of a sequence of nested subcomplexes generated by expansions and fillings-two operations originally introduced by Whitehead. Expansions preserve homotopy, while fillings introduce critical simplexes that capture essential topological features. We extend the notion of Morse sequences to \emph{stacks}, which are monotonic functions defined on simplicial complexes, and define \emph{Morse sequences on stacks} as those whose expansions preserve the homotopy of all sublevel sets. This extension leads to a generalization of the fundamental collapse theorem to weighted simplicial complexes. Within this framework, we focus on a refined class of sequences called \emph{flooding sequences}, which exhibit an ordering behavior similar to that of classical watershed algorithms. Although not every Morse sequence on a stack is a flooding sequence, we show that the gradient vector field associated with any Morse sequence can be recovered through a flooding sequence. Finally, we present algorithmic schemes for computing flooding sequences using cosimplicial complexes.</description>
