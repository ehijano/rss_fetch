      <title>Efficient construction of effective Hamiltonians with a hybrid machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective Hamiltonian method is a powerful tool for simulating large-scale systems across a wide range of temperatures. However, previous methods for constructing effective Hamiltonian models suffer from key limitations: some require to manually predefine interaction terms limited flexibility in capturing complex systems, while others lack efficiency in selecting optimal interactions. In this work, we introduce the Lasso-GA Hybrid Method (LGHM), a novel approach that combines Lasso regression and genetic algorithms to rapidly construct effective Hamiltonian models. Such method is broadly applicable to both magnetic systems (e.g., spin Hamiltonians) and atomic displacement models. To verify the reliability and usefulness of LGHM, we take monolayer CrI_3 and Fe_3 GaTe_2 as examples. In both cases, LGHM not only successfully identifies key interaction terms with high fitting accuracy, but also reproduces experimental magnetic ground states and Curie temperatures with further Monte Carlo simulations. Notable, our analysis of monolayer Fe_3 GaTe_2 reveals that the single-ion anisotropy and Heisenberg interaction lead to an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, while the fourth-order interactions contribute significantly to the high Curie temperature. Our method is general so it can be applied to construct other effective Hamiltonian models.</description>

      <title>Structure determination from single-molecule X-ray scattering images using stochastic gradient ascent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering experiments using ultrashort X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) pulses have opened a new path for structure determination of a wide variety of specimens, including nano-crystals and entire viruses, approaching atomistic spatial and femtoseconds time resolution. However, random and unknown sample orientations as well as low signal to noise ratios have so far prevented a successful application to smaller specimens like single biomolecules. We here present resolution-annealed stochastic gradient ascent (RASTA), a new approach for direct atomistic electron density determination, which utilizes our recently developed rigorous Bayesian treatment of single-particle X-ray scattering. We demonstrate electron density determination at 2\r{A} resolution of various small proteins from synthetic scattering images with as low as 15 photons per image.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BraWl, a Fortran package implementing a range of conventional and enhanced sampling algorithms for exploration of the phase space of the Bragg-Williams model, facilitating study of diffusional solid-solid transformations in binary and multicomponent alloys. These sampling algorithms include Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo, Wang-Landau sampling, and Nested Sampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of the package by applying it to some prototypical binary and multicomponent alloys, including high-entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory: a generalised dividing-surface approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing an accurate approximation to nonadiabatic rate theory which is valid for arbitrary values of the electronic coupling has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical chemistry. Ring-polymer instanton theories offer a very promising approach to solve this problem, since they can be rigorously derived using semiclassical approximations and can capture nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling and zero-point energy at a cost similar to that of a classical calculation. A successful instanton rate theory already exists within the Born--Oppenheimer approximation, for which the optimal tunnelling pathway is located on a single adiabatic surface. A related instanton theory has also been developed for nonadiabatic reactions using two weakly-coupled diabatic surfaces within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. However, many chemical reactions do not satisfy the conditions of either limit. By employing a tunable dividing surface which measures the flux both along nuclear coordinates as well as between electronic states, we develop a generalised nonadiabatic instanton rate theory that bridges between these two limits. The resulting theory approximates the quantum-mechanically exact rates well for the systems studied and, in addition, offers a novel mechanistic perspective on nonadiabatic reactions.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass quantum phase transition in amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experiments performed with neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezers and coherently coupled to the Rydberg state allow quantum simulations of paradigmatic Hamiltonians for quantum magnetism. Previous studies have focused mainly on periodic arrangements of the optical tweezers, which host various spatially ordered magnetic phases. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the ground state of quantum Ising models for amorphous arrays of Rydberg atoms. These models are designed to feature well-controlled local structural properties in the absence of long-range order. Notably, by determining the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, we find evidence of a quantum phase transition from a paramagnetic to a spin-glass phase. The magnetic structure factor indicates short-range isotropic antiferromagnetic correlations. For the feasible sizes, the spin-overlap distribution features a nontrivial structure with two broad peaks and a sizable weight at zero overlap. The comparison against results for the clean kagome lattice, which features local structural properties similar to those of our amorphous arrays, highlights the important role of the absence of long-range structural order of the underlying array. Our findings indicate a route to experimentally implement the details of a Hamiltonian which hosts a quantum spin-glass phase.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enabled atomistic insights into phase boundary engineering of solid-solution ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic control of phase boundaries is crucial for optimizing the functional properties of solid-solution ferroelectrics, yet their microstructural mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we harness machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics to resolve the phase boundary behavior in the KNbO3-KTaO3 (KNTO) system. Our simulations reveal that chemical composition and ordering enable precise modulation of polymorphic phase boundaries (PPBs), offering a versatile pathway for materials engineering. Diffused PPBs and polar nano regions, predicted by our model, highly match with experiments, underscoring the fidelity of the machine-learning atomistic simulation. Crucially, we identify elastic and electrostatic mismatches between ferroelectric KNbO3 and paraelectric KTaO3 as the driving forces behind complex microstructural evolution. This work not only resolves the longstanding microstructural debate but also establishes a generalizable framework for phase boundary engineering toward next-generation high-performance ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm for computing hydrodynamic forces on particles in Euler-Lagrange point-particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the hydrodynamic forces on particles is central to the fidelity of Euler-Lagrange (EL) simulations of particle-laden flows. Traditional EL methods typically rely on determining the hydrodynamic forces at the positions of the individual particles from the interpolated fluid velocity field, and feed these hydrodynamic forces back to the location of the particles. This approach can introduce significant errors in two-way coupled simulations, especially when the particle diameter is not much smaller than the computational grid spacing. In this study, we propose a novel force correlation framework that circumvents the need for undisturbed velocity estimation by leveraging volume-filtered quantities available directly from EL simulations. Through a rigorous analytical derivation in the Stokes regime and extensive particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) at finite Reynolds numbers, we formulate force correlations that depend solely on the volume-filtered fluid velocity and local volume fraction, parametrized by the filter width. These correlations are shown to recover known drag laws in the appropriate asymptotic limits and exhibit a good agreement with analytical and high-fidelity numerical benchmarks for single particle cases, and, compared to existing correlations, an improved agreement for the drag force on particles in particle assemblies. The proposed framework significantly enhances the accuracy of hydrodynamic force predictions for both isolated particles and dense suspensions, without incurring the prohibitive computational costs associated with reconstructing undisturbed flow fields. This advancement lays the foundation for robust, scalable, and high-fidelity EL simulations of complex particulate flows across a wide range of industrial and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Optical Properties of the Recently Synthesized 2D Vivianites (Vivianenes): Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vivianite (Fe$_3$(PO$_4$)$_2$8H$_2$O) is a naturally occurring layered material with significant environmental and technological relevance. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, Vivianene, focusing on its structural, electronic, and optical properties. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, we evaluate its thermodynamic stability, band structure, density of states, and optical response. Our results confirm that Vivianene retains the main structural features of bulk Vivianite while exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic stability at room temperature. The electronic structure analysis reveals an indirect bandgap of 3.03 eV for Vivianene, which is slightly lower than the 3.21 eV observed for bulk Vivianite, deviating from the expected quantum confinement trend in 2D materials. The projected density of states (PDOS) analysis indicates that Fe d orbitals predominantly contribute to the valence and conduction bands. Optical calculations demonstrate that Vivianene exhibits a higher optical band gap (3.6 eV) than bulk Vivianite (3.2 eV), with significant absorption in the ultraviolet region. The refractive index and reflectivity analyses suggest that most of the incident light is absorbed rather than reflected, reinforcing its potential for optoelectronic applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental properties of Vivianene and highlight its potential for advanced applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and energy-related technologies.</description>

      <title>Machine learning model for efficient nonthermal tuning of the charge density wave in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the charge density wave (CDW) phase diagram of transition metal dichalcogenides is a long-studied problem in condensed matter physics. However, due to complex involvement of electron and lattice degrees of freedom and pronounced anharmonicity, theoretical simulations of the CDW phase diagram at the density-functional-theory level are often numerically demanding. To reduce the computational cost of first principles modelling by orders of magnitude, we have developed an electronic free energy machine learning model for monolayer NbSe$_2$ that allows changing both electronic and ionic temperatures independently. Our approach relies on a machine learning model of the electronic density of states and zero-temperature interatomic potential. This allows us to explore the CDW phase diagram of monolayer NbSe$_2$ both under thermal and laser-induced nonthermal conditions. Our study provides an accurate estimate of the CDW transition temperature at low cost and can disentangle the role of hot electrons and phonons in nonthermal ultrafast melting process of the CDW phase in NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an inviscid Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach for the rapid aerodynamic assessment of Flettner rotor systems on ships. The method relies on the Eulerian flow equations, approximated utilizing a state-of-the-art Finite Volume Method with a dynamic momentum source term to enforce rotor circulation. The method offers substantial computational savings by avoiding near-wall refinement and easing time step constraints, making it ideal for early design phases such as design space exploration. Validation against potential flow theory and viscous reference simulations confirms that the method reliably predicts lift-induced forces despite its limitations in capturing parasitic drag. Three-dimensional simulations, including idealized wind tunnel setups and full-scale ship applications at high Reynolds numbers (up to ReL=1E08), demonstrate that results based on low-order convection featuring a solid numerical viscosity yield deviations with respect to viscous reference data of around O(10%). Accepting this reasonable loss of predictive accuracy provides a simulation framework with response times in the order of minutes compared to hours or even days.</description>

      <title>Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Asymptotic Preserving Discrete Velocity Methods into the Simulation Code PICLas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model of the Boltzmann equation allows for efficient flow simulations, especially in the transition regime between continuum and high rarefaction. However, ensuring efficient performances for multiscale flows, in which the Knudsen number varies by several orders of magnitude, is never straightforward. Discrete velocity methods as well as particle-based solvers can each reveal advantageous in different conditions, but not without compromises in specific regimes. This article presents a second-order asymptotic preserving discrete velocity method to solve the BGK equation, with the particularity of maintaining positivity when operations are conducted with the cell-local distribution function. With this procedure based on exponential differencing, it is therefore also possible to construct an adapted version of this second-order method using the stochastic particle approach, as previously presented. The deterministic variant and its implementation are detailed here and its performances are evaluated on several test cases. Combined to the probabilistic solver and with the possibility of a future coupling, our exponential differencing discrete velocity method provides a robust toolbox, useful for efficiently simulating multiscale gas phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the computational aspects of detecting topological order in a quantum many-body system. We contrast the widely used topological entanglement entropy with a recently introduced operational definition for topological order based on error correction properties, finding exponential scaling with the system size for the former and polynomial scaling for the latter. We exemplify our approach for a variant of the paradigmatic toric code model with mobile particles, finding that the error correction method allows to treat substantially larger system sizes. In particular, the phase diagram of the model can be successfully computed using error correction, while the topological entanglement entropy is too severely limited by finite size effects to obtain conclusive results. While we mainly focus on one-dimensional systems whose ground states can be expressed in terms of matrix product states, our strategy can be readily generalized to higher dimensions and systems out of equilibrium, even allowing for an efficient detection of topological order in current quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning stochastic dynamics from snapshots through regularized unbalanced optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</description>

      <title>In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI</title>

Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</description>

      <title>Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials are Ready for Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an ongoing race for the past several years to develop the best universal machinelearning interatomic potential. This progress has led to increasingly accurate models for predictingenergy, forces, and stresses, combining innovative architectures with big data. Here, we benchmarkthese models on their ability to predict harmonic phonon properties, which are critical for under-standing the vibrational and thermal behavior of materials. Using around 10 000 ab initio phononcalculations, we evaluate model performance across various phonon-related parameters to test theuniversal applicability of these models. The results reveal that some models achieve high accuracyin predicting harmonic phonon properties. However, others still exhibit substantial inaccuracies,even if they excel in the prediction of the energy and the forces for materials close to dynamicalequilibrium. These findings highlight the importance of considering phonon-related properties inthe development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381</link>

Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>A Unified Simulation Framework for Correlated Driven-Dissipative Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy provides a unique and direct way to explore the real-time nonequilibrium dynamics of electrons and holes. The formal theory of the spectral function evolution requires inclusion of electronic correlations and dissipation, which are challenging due to the associated long simulation timescales which translate to a high computational cost. Recent methodological developments, namely the Real-Time Dyson Expansion, as well as theoretical developments of many-body perturbation theory for dissipative systems, have allowed for the study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems. In this work, we implement the hitherto unrealized study of driven-dissipative interacting quantum systems which includes driven dynamical correlations and utilizes these new methods and perturbative expansions. We illustrate the combined formalism on a prototypical two-band semiconductor model with long-range density-density Coulomb interactions. We show that the intraband thermalization of conduction band electrons induces nontrivial time-dependent changes in the system's bandstructure and a time-evolving band-gap renormalization (with a reduction by up to 10\%). We show that the qualitative features are preserved for a variety of parameters, discuss the corresponding spectral dynamics, and provide an outlook on the newly introduced simulation framework, which enables treating electron-electron scattering and dissipation effects on equal footing.</description>

      <title>Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity and are hoped to provide the dynamics of loop quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. The well-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for testing analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a data-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the vertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep learning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in particular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain, while the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is trained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.</description>
