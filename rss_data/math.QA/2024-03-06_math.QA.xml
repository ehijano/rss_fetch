      <title>Constructing Modular Tensor Categories with Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modular tensor category is a non-degenerate ribbon finite tensor category. And a ribbon factorizable Hopf algebra is exactly the Hopf algebra whose finite-dimensional representations form a modular tensor category. The goal of this paper is to construct both semisimple and non-semisimple modular categories with Hopf algebras. In particular, we study central extensions of Hopf algebras and characterize some conditions for a quotient Hopf algebra to be a factorizable one. Then we give a special way to obtain ribbon elements. As a result, we apply to some finite dimensional pointed Hopf algebras introduced by Andruskiewitsch etc and obtain two families of ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras. With little restrictions to their parameters, we prove that their representation categories are prime modular tensor categories which are not tensor equivalent to representation categories of small quantum groups. Lastly, we construct a family of semisimple ribbon factorizable Hopf algebas A(p,q), where p,q are prime numbers satisfying some conditions. And we decompose Rep(A(p,q)) into prime modular tensor categories and prove that A(p,q) can't be obtained by some obvious ways, i.e. it's not tensor product of trivial Hopf algebras (group algebras or their dual) and Drinfeld doubles.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig Correspondence for Vertex Operator Superalgebras from Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig correspondence for a class of vertex operator superalgebras which, via the work of Costello-Gaiotto, arise as boundary VOAs of topological B twist of 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ abelian gauge theories. This means that we show equivalences of braided tensor categories of modules of certain affine vertex superalgebras and corresponding quantum supergroups.
  We build on the work of Creutzig-Lentner-Rupert to this large class of VOAs and extend it since in our case the categories don't have projective objectives and objects can have arbitrary Jordan H\"older length.
  Our correspondence significantly improves the understanding of the braided tensor category of line defects associated to this class of TQFT, by realizing line defects as modules of a Hopf algebra. In the process, we prove a case of the conjecture of Semikhatov-Tipunin, relating logarithmic CFTs to Nichols algebras of screening operators.</description>

      <title>Binomial Coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson Coefficients for Interpolation Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous versions of Jack and Macdonald polynomials, called interpolation polynomials, have been introduced by Knop--Sahi (type $A$) and Okounkov (type $BC$). In this paper, we study binomial coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson (LR) coefficients for these interpolation polynomials. We extend to type $BC$ the weighted sum formula for binomial coefficients due to the second author in type $A$, and obtain a new weighted sum formula for LR coefficients for both types $A$ and $BC$. We prove that binomial coefficients are positive and monotone using the weighted sum formula and the combinatorial formulas due to Okounkov. As an application, we show that the containment partial order can be characterized in terms of Schur positivity or Jack positivity. This result is in parallel with the work of Cuttler--Greene--Skandera, Sra and Khare--Tao, which characterize two other partial orders, majorization and weak majorization, in terms of evaluation positivity of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>Higher form symmetries and orbifolds of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

      <title>Classification of modular data of integral modular fusion categories up to rank 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01613v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a classification of all integral modular fusion categories' modular data and, more broadly, all integral half-Frobenius fusion rings, up to rank 12. We get that each perfect integral modular fusion category, as well as every perfect integral half-Frobenius fusion ring, up to rank 12, is trivial. Furthermore, we establish that every integral modular fusion category of rank 13 is pointed, up to 2 types in progress. We have also refined the categorifiable non-pointed odd-dimensional modular data at ranks below 25 to three possible items, all of rank 17, FPdim 225, and type [[1,3],[3,8],[5,6]], filling literature potential gaps. For rank 25, we have narrowed down the perfect case to 21 types.
  Our initial key insight is that the Egyptian fractions, which are typically employed to list possible types, can be chosen with squared denominators. We then develop several type criteria as initial filters. Particularly, we establish that the number of distinct basic FPdims in a non-trivial perfect fusion ring must be at least 4. To obtain the fusion rings, we solve the dimension and associativity equations using an updated version of Normaliz designed specifically for this purpose. The S-matrices (if they exist) are obtained by self-transposing the character table, while the T-matrices are derived by solving the Anderson-Moore-Vafa equations. Finally, we verify the extended axioms of modular data.</description>

      <title>Geometric Positivity of the Fusion Products of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebra Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unitary and strongly rational vertex operator algebra (VOA) $V$ is called strongly unitary if all irreducible $V$-modules are unitarizable. A strongly unitary VOA $V$ is called completely unitary if for each unitary $V$-modules $W_1$, $W_2$ the canonical nondegenerate Hermitian form on the fusion product $W_1\boxtimes W_2$ is positive. It is known that if $V$ is completely unitary, then the modular category of unitary $V$-modules is unitary [Gui19b], and all simple VOA extensions of V are automatically unitary and moreover completely unitary [Gui22, CGGH23].
  In this paper, we give a geometric characterization of the positivity of the Hermitian product on $W_1$ and $W_2$, which helps us prove that the positivity is always true when the fusion product $W_1\boxtimes W_2$ is an irreducible and unitarizable $V$-module. We give several applications: (1) We show that if $V$ is a unitary (strongly rational) holomorphic VOA with a finite cyclic unitary automorphism group $G$, and if $V^G$ is strongly unitary, then $V^G$ is completely unitary. This result applies to the cyclic permutation orbifolds of unitary holomophic VOAs. (2) We show that if $V$ is unitary and strongly rational, and if $U$ is a simple current extension which is unitarizable as a $V$-module, then $U$ is a unitary VOA.</description>
