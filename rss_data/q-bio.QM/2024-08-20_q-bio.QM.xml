      <title>Long-term tracking of social structure in groups of rats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rodents serve as an important model for examining both individual and collective behavior. Dominance within rodent social structures can determine access to critical resources, such as food and mating opportunities. Yet, many aspects of the intricate interplay between individual behaviors and the resulting group social hierarchy, especially its evolution over time, remain unexplored. In this study, we utilized an automated tracking system that continuously monitored groups of male rats for over 250 days to enable an in-depth analysis of individual behavior and the overarching group dynamic. We describe the evolution of social structures within a group and additionally investigate how past behaviors influence the emergence of new social hierarchies when group composition and experimental area changes. Notably, we find that conventional individual and pairwise tests exhibit a weak correlation with group behavior, highlighting their limited accuracy in predicting behavioral outcomes in a collective context. These results emphasize the context-dependence of social behavior as an emergent property of interactions within a group and highlight the need to measure and quantify social behavior in more naturalistic environments.</description>

      <title>mRNA2vec: mRNA Embedding with Language Model in the 5'UTR-CDS for mRNA Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines are accelerating the discovery of new drugs and revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry. However, selecting particular mRNA sequences for vaccines and therapeutics from extensive mRNA libraries is costly. Effective mRNA therapeutics require carefully designed sequences with optimized expression levels and stability. This paper proposes a novel contextual language model (LM)-based embedding method: mRNA2vec. In contrast to existing mRNA embedding approaches, our method is based on the self-supervised teacher-student learning framework of data2vec. We jointly use the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) region as the input sequences. We adapt our LM-based approach specifically to mRNA by 1) considering the importance of location on the mRNA sequence with probabilistic masking, 2) using Minimum Free Energy (MFE) prediction and Secondary Structure (SS) classification as additional pretext tasks. mRNA2vec demonstrates significant improvements in translation efficiency (TE) and expression level (EL) prediction tasks in UTR compared to SOTA methods such as UTR-LM. It also gives a competitive performance in mRNA stability and protein production level tasks in CDS such as CodonBERT.</description>

      <title>Screen Them All: High-Throughput Pan-Cancer Genetic and Phenotypic Biomarker Screening from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09554v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many molecular alterations serve as clinically prognostic or therapy-predictive biomarkers, typically detected using single or multi-gene molecular assays. However, these assays are expensive, tissue destructive and often take weeks to complete. Using AI on routine H&amp;E WSIs offers a fast and economical approach to screen for multiple molecular biomarkers. We present a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2, a foundation model pre-trained on 3 million slides, to interrogate genomic features previously determined by an next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, using 47,960 scanned hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) whole slide images (WSIs) from 38,984 cancer patients. Unlike traditional methods that train individual models for each biomarker or cancer type, our system employs a unified model to simultaneously predict a wide range of clinically relevant molecular biomarkers across cancer types. By training the network to replicate the MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel of 505 genes, it identified 80 high performing biomarkers with a mean AU-ROC of 0.89 in 15 most common cancer types. In addition, 40 biomarkers demonstrated strong associations with specific cancer histologic subtypes. Furthermore, 58 biomarkers were associated with targets frequently assayed clinically for therapy selection and response prediction. The model can also predict the activity of five canonical signaling pathways, identify defects in DNA repair mechanisms, and predict genomic instability measured by tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability (MSI), and chromosomal instability (CIN). The proposed model can offer potential to guide therapy selection, improve treatment efficacy, accelerate patient screening for clinical trials and provoke the interrogation of new therapeutic targets.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as ``cells'' that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences. We provide several numerical examples and conclude that the method associated with the ``Split Coupling'' provides the most efficient algorithm. This finding is in line with the conclusions from the work related to sensitivity analysis of standard stochastic reaction networks. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>

      <title>Probing leukemia cells behavior under starvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of a cancer cell population to achieve heterogeneity in their phenotype distributions offers advantages in tumor invasiveness and drug resistance. Studying the mechanisms behind such observed heterogeneity in mammalian cells presents challenges due for instance to the prolonged proliferation times compared to widely studied unicellular organisms like bacteria and yeast. Here, we studied the response of leukemia cell populations to serum starvation via a protocol, we recently developed, that makes use of live cell fluorescence and flow cytometry in combination with a quantitative analytical model to follow the population proliferation while monitoring the dynamics of its phenotype distributions. We found that upon switching between a serum-rich to a serum-poor media, leukemia cells (i) maintain a memory of the previous environment up to one generation even in the presence of severe medium-depletion, before (ii) adapting their growth and division rates to the novel environment while preserving a sizer-like division strategy. Finally, looking at the mitochondria content of the proliferating vs non-proliferating cells, we found that the latter is characterized by a higher number of older mitochondria, suggesting a possible functional role of the observed asymmetric partitioning of (aged) mitochondria in leukemia cells.</description>

      <title>Improving Genomic Prediction using High-dimensional Secondary Phenotypes: the Genetic Latent Factor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decreasing costs and new technologies have led to an increase in the amount of data available to plant breeding programs. High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms routinely generate high-dimensional datasets of secondary features that may be used to improve genomic prediction accuracy. However, integration of this data comes with challenges such as multicollinearity, parameter estimation in $p &gt; n$ settings, and the computational complexity of many standard approaches. Several methods have emerged to analyze such data, but interpretation of model parameters often remains challenging.
  We propose genetic factor best linear unbiased prediction (gfBLUP), a seven-step prediction pipeline that reduces the dimensionality of the original secondary HTP data using generative factor analysis. In short, gfBLUP uses redundancy filtered and regularized genetic and residual correlation matrices to fit a maximum likelihood factor model and estimate genetic latent factor scores. These latent factors are subsequently used in multi-trait genomic prediction. Our approach performs on par or better than alternatives in extensive simulations and a real-world application, while producing easily interpretable and biologically relevant parameters. We discuss several possible extensions and highlight gfBLUP as the basis for a flexible and modular multi-trait genomic prediction framework.</description>

      <title>PhaGO: Protein function annotation for bacteriophages by integrating the genomic context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteriophages are viruses that target bacteria, playing a crucial role in microbial ecology. Phage proteins are important in understanding phage biology, such as virus infection, replication, and evolution. Although a large number of new phages have been identified via metagenomic sequencing, many of them have limited protein function annotation. Accurate function annotation of phage proteins presents several challenges, including their inherent diversity and the scarcity of annotated ones. Existing tools have yet to fully leverage the unique properties of phages in annotating protein functions. In this work, we propose a new protein function annotation tool for phages by leveraging the modular genomic structure of phage genomes. By employing embeddings from the latest protein foundation models and Transformer to capture contextual information between proteins in phage genomes, PhaGO surpasses state-of-the-art methods in annotating diverged proteins and proteins with uncommon functions by 6.78% and 13.05% improvement, respectively. PhaGO can annotate proteins lacking homology search results, which is critical for characterizing the rapidly accumulating phage genomes. We demonstrate the utility of PhaGO by identifying 688 potential holins in phages, which exhibit high structural conservation with known holins. The results show the potential of PhaGO to extend our understanding of newly discovered phages.</description>

      <title>GCondNet: A Novel Method for Improving Neural Networks on Small High-Dimensional Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks often struggle with high-dimensional but small sample-size tabular datasets. One reason is that current weight initialisation methods assume independence between weights, which can be problematic when there are insufficient samples to estimate the model's parameters accurately. In such small data scenarios, leveraging additional structures can improve the model's performance and training stability. To address this, we propose GCondNet, a general approach to enhance neural networks by leveraging implicit structures present in tabular data. We create a graph between samples for each data dimension, and utilise Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract this implicit structure, and for conditioning the parameters of the first layer of an underlying predictor network. By creating many small graphs, GCondNet exploits the data's high-dimensionality, and thus improves the performance of an underlying predictor network. We demonstrate GCondNet's effectiveness on 12 real-world datasets, where it outperforms 14 standard and state-of-the-art methods. The results show that GCondNet is a versatile framework for injecting graph-regularisation into various types of neural networks, including MLPs and tabular Transformers.

      <title>Generic consistency and nondegeneracy of vertically parametrized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the generic consistency, dimension and nondegeneracy of the zero locus over $\mathbb{C}^*$, $\mathbb{R}^*$ and $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ of vertically parametrized systems: parametric polynomial systems consisting of linear combinations of monomials scaled by free parameters. These systems generalize sparse systems with fixed monomial support and freely varying parametric coefficients. As our main result, we establish the equivalence among three key properties: the existence of nondegenerate zeros, the zero set having generically the expected dimension, and the system being generically consistent. Importantly, we prove that checking whether a vertically parametrized system has these properties amounts to an easily computed matrix rank condition.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <title>On the importance of assessing topological convergence in Bayesian phylogenetic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern phylogenetics research is often performed within a Bayesian framework, using sampling algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior distribution. These algorithms require careful evaluation of the quality of the generated samples. Within the field of phylogenetics, one frequently adopted diagnostic approach is to evaluate the effective sample size (ESS) and to investigate trace graphs of the sampled parameters. A major limitation of these approaches is that they are developed for continuous parameters and therefore incompatible with a crucial parameter in these inferences: the tree topology. Several recent advancements have aimed at extending these diagnostics to topological space. In this reflection paper, we present two case studies - one on Ebola virus and one on HIV - illustrating how these topological diagnostics can contain information not found in standard diagnostics, and how decisions regarding which of these diagnostics to compute can impact inferences regarding MCMC convergence and mixing. Our results show the importance of running multiple replicate analyses and of carefully assessing topological convergence using the output of these replicate analyses. To this end, we illustrate different ways of assessing and visualizing the topological convergence of these replicates. Given the major importance of detecting convergence and mixing issues in Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, the lack of a unified approach to this problem warrants further action, especially now that additional tools are becoming available to researchers.</description>

      <title>Inferring directed spectral information flow between mixed-frequency time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying directed spectral information flow between multivariate time series is important for many applications in finance, climate, geophysics and neuroscience. Spectral Granger causality (SGC) is a prediction-based measure characterizing directed information flow at specific oscillatory frequencies. However, traditional vector autoregressive (VAR) approaches are insufficient to assess SGC when time series have mixed frequencies (MF) or are coupled by nonlinearity. Here we propose a time-frequency canonical correlation analysis approach ("MF-TFCCA") to assess the strength and driving frequency of spectral information flow. We validate the approach with intensive computer simulations on MF time series under various interaction conditions and assess statistical significance of the estimate with surrogate data. We further apply MF-TFCCA to real-life finance, climate and neuroscience data. Our analysis framework provides an exploratory and computationally efficient approach to quantify directed information flow between MF time series in the presence of complex and nonlinear interactions.</description>
