      <title>Directed Hypercube Routing, a Generalized Lehman-Ron Theorem, and Monotonicity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to monotonicity testing, Lehman and Ron (JCTA, 2001) proved the existence of a collection of vertex disjoint paths between comparable sub-level sets in the directed hypercube. The main technical contribution of this paper is a new proof method that yields a generalization to their theorem: we prove the existence of two edge-disjoint collections of vertex disjoint paths. Our main conceptual contribution are conjectures on directed hypercube flows with simultaneous vertex and edge capacities of which our generalized Lehman-Ron theorem is a special case. We show that these conjectures imply directed isoperimetric theorems, and in particular, the robust directed Talagrand inequality due to Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SIAM J. on Comp, 2018). These isoperimetric inequalities, that relate the directed surface area (of a set in the hypercube) to its distance to monotonicity, have been crucial in obtaining the best monotonicity testers for Boolean functions. We believe our conjectures pave the way towards combinatorial proofs of these directed isoperimetry theorems.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap percolation on rhombus tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2-boostrap percolation on a graph is a diffusion process where a vertex gets infected whenever it has at least 2 infected neighbours, and then stays infected forever. It has been much studied on the infinite grid for random Bernoulli initial configurations, starting from the seminal result of van Enter that establishes that the entire grid gets almost surely entirely infected for any non-trivial initial probability of infection. In this paper, we generalize this result to any adjacency graph of any rhombus tiling of the plane, including aperiodic ones like Penrose tilings. We actually show almost sure infection of the entire graph for a larger class of measure than non-trivial Bernoulli ones. Our proof strategy combines a geometry toolkit for infected clusters based on chain-convexity, and uniform probabilistic bounds on particular geometric patterns that play the role of 0-1 laws or ergodicity, which are not available in our settings due to the lack of symmetry of the graph considered.</description>

      <title>On Oriented Diameter of Power Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the oriented diameter of power graphs of groups. We show that a $2$-edge connected power graph of a finite group has oriented diameter at most $4$. We prove that the power graph of a cyclic group of order $n$ has oriented diameter $2$ for all $n\neq 2,4,6$. Until our work, to the best of our knowledge, no infinite family of graphs with oriented diameter 2 had been identified except for subclasses of complete graphs. Finally, we give a complete characterization of the oriented diameter of the power graphs of nilpotent groups. This, in turn, gives an algorithm for computing the oriented diameter of the power graph of a given nilpotent group that runs in time polynomial in the size of the group.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Circular-arc Graphs: III. Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs, thereby resolving one of ``the main open problems'' concerning the structures of circular-arc graphs as posed by Dur{\'{a}}n, Grippo, and Safe in 2011. The problem had been attempted even earlier, and previous efforts have yielded partial results, particularly for claw-free graphs and graphs with an independence number of at most four. The answers turn out to have very simple structures: all the nontrivial ones belong to a single family. Our findings are based on a structural study of McConnell's flipping, which transforms circular-arc graphs into interval graphs with certain representation patterns.</description>

      <title>Capacitated Network Bargaining Games: Stability and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Capacitated network bargaining games are popular combinatorial games that involve the structure of matchings in graphs. We show that it is always possible to stabilize unit-weight instances of this problem (that is, ensure that they admit a stable outcome) via capacity-reduction and edge-removal operations, without decreasing the total value that the players can get.
  Furthermore, for general weighted instances, we show that computing a minimum amount of vertex-capacity to reduce to make an instance stable is a polynomial-time solvable problem. We then exploit this to give approximation results for the NP-hard problem of stabilizing a graph via edge-removal operations.
  Our work extends and generalizes previous results in the literature that dealt with a unit-capacity version of the problem, using several new arguments. In particular, while previous results mainly used combinatorial techniques, we here rely on polyhedral arguments and, more specifically, on the notion of circuits of a polytope.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Treewidth of Outer $k$-Planar Graphs via Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The treewidth is a structural parameter that measures the tree-likeness of a graph. Many algorithmic and combinatorial results are expressed in terms of the treewidth. In this paper, we study the treewidth of outer $k$-planar graphs, that is, graphs that admit a straight-line drawing where all the vertices lie on a circle, and every edge is crossed by at most $k$ other edges.
  Wood and Telle [New York J. Math., 2007] showed that every outer $k$-planar graph has treewidth at most $3k + 11$ using so-called planar decompositions, and later, Auer et al. [Algorithmica, 2016] proved that the treewidth of outer $1$-planar graphs is at most $3$, which is tight.
  In this paper, we improve the general upper bound to $1.5k + 2$ and give a tight bound of $4$ for $k = 2$. We also establish a lower bound: we show that, for every even $k$, there is an outer $k$-planar graph with treewidth $k+2$. Our new bound immediately implies a better bound on the cop number, which answers an open question of Durocher et al. [GD 2023] in the affirmative.
  Our treewidth bound relies on a new and simple triangulation method for outer $k$-planar graphs that yields few crossings with graph edges per edge of the triangulation. Our method also enables us to obtain a tight upper bound of $k + 2$ for the separation number of outer $k$-planar graphs, improving an upper bound of $2k + 3$ by Chaplick et al. [GD 2017]. We also consider outer min-$k$-planar graphs, a generalization of outer $k$-planar graphs, where we achieve smaller improvements.</description>

      <title>Maximal Cliques in Scale-Free Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the number of maximal cliques, i.e., cliques that are not contained in any larger clique, in three network models: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, inhomogeneous random graphs (also called Chung-Lu graphs), and geometric inhomogeneous random graphs. For sparse and not-too-dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we give linear and polynomial upper bounds on the number of maximal cliques. For the dense regime, we give super-polynomial and even exponential lower bounds. Although (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs are sparse, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for these models. This comes from the fact that these graphs have a power-law degree distribution, which leads to a dense subgraph in which we find many maximal cliques. These lower bounds seem to contradict previous empirical evidence that (geometric) inhomogeneous random graphs have only few maximal cliques. We resolve this contradiction by providing experiments indicating that, even for large networks, the linear lower-order terms dominate, before the super-polynomial asymptotic behavior kicks in only for networks of extreme size.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Balanced Cluster Edge Modification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study {\sc Cluster Edge Modification} problems with constraints on the size of the clusters. A graph $G$ is a cluster graph if every connected component of $G$ is a clique. In a typical {\sc Cluster Edge Modification} problem such as the widely studied {\sc Cluster Editing}, we are given a graph $G$ and a non-negative integer $k$ as input, and we have to decide if we can turn $G$ into a cluster graph by way of at most $k$ edge modifications -- that is, by adding or deleting edges. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity of such problems, but with an additional constraint: The size difference between any two connected components of the resulting cluster graph should not exceed a given threshold. Depending on which modifications are permissible -- only adding edges, only deleting edges, both adding and deleting edges -- we have three different computational problems. We show that all three problems, when parameterized by $k$, admit single-exponential time FPT algorithms and polynomial kernels. Our problems may be thought of as the size-constrained or balanced counterparts of the typical {\sc Cluster Edge Modification} problems, similar to the well-studied size-constrained or balanced counterparts of other clustering problems such as {\sc $k$-Means Clustering}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present algorithms for generating small random samples without replacement. We consider two cases. We present an algorithm for sampling a pair of distinct integers, and an algorithm for sampling a triple of distinct integers. The worst-case runtime of both algorithms is constant, while the worst-case runtimes of common algorithms for the general case of sampling $k$ elements from a set of $n$ increase with $n$. Java implementations of both algorithms are included in the open source library $\rho\mu$.</description>

      <title>Crossing Numbers of Beyond Planar Graphs Re-revisited: A Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond planarity concepts (prominent examples include k-planarity or fan-planarity) apply certain restrictions on the allowed patterns of crossings in drawings. It is natural to ask, how much the number of crossings may increase over the traditional (unrestricted) crossing number. Previous approaches to bound such ratios, e.g. [arXiv:1908.03153, arXiv:2105.12452], require very specialized constructions and arguments for each considered beyond planarity concept, and mostly only yield asymptotically non-tight bounds. We propose a very general proof framework that allows us to obtain asymptotically tight bounds, and where the concept-specific parts of the proof typically boil down to a couple of lines. We show the strength of our approach by giving improved or first bounds for several beyond planarity concepts.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Histograms in All Privacy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency estimation, a.k.a. histograms, is a workhorse of data analysis, and as such has been thoroughly studied under differentially privacy. In particular, computing histograms in the \emph{local} model of privacy has been the focus of a fruitful recent line of work, and various algorithms have been proposed, achieving the order-optimal $\ell_\infty$ error in the high-privacy (small $\varepsilon$) regime while balancing other considerations such as time- and communication-efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, the picture is much less clear when it comes to the medium- or low-privacy regime (large $\varepsilon$), despite its increased relevance in practice. In this paper, we investigate locally private histograms, and the very related distribution learning task, in this medium-to-low privacy regime, and establish near-tight (and somewhat unexpected) bounds on the $\ell_\infty$ error achievable. As a direct corollary of our results, we obtain a protocol for histograms in the \emph{shuffle} model of differential privacy, with accuracy matching previous algorithms but significantly better message and communication complexity.
  Our theoretical findings emerge from a novel analysis, which appears to improve bounds across the board for the locally private histogram problem. We back our theoretical findings by an empirical comparison of existing algorithms in all privacy regimes, to assess their typical performance and behaviour beyond the worst-case setting.</description>

Abstract: The burnt pancake graph, denoted by $\mathbb{BP}_n$, is formed by connecting signed permutations via prefix reversals. Here, we discuss some spectral properties of $\mathbb{BP}_n$. More precisely, we prove that the adjacency spectrum of $\mathbb{BP}_n$ contains all integer values in the set $\{0, 1, \ldots, n\}\setminus\{\left\lfloor n/2 \right\rfloor\}$.</description>
