      <title>Efficient algorithms for optimal homology problems and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiscale simplicial flat norm (MSFN) of a d-cycle is a family of optimal homology problems indexed by a scale parameter {\lambda} &gt;= 0. Each instance (mSFN) optimizes the total weight of a homologous d-cycle and a bounded (d + 1)-chain, with one of the components being scaled by {\lambda}.We propose a min-cost flow formulation for solving instances of mSFN at a given scale {\lambda} in polynomial time in the case of (d + 1)-dimensional simplicial complexes embedded in {R^(d + 1)} and homology over Z. Furthermore, we establish the weak and strong dualities for mSFN, as well as the complementary slackness conditions. Additionally, we prove optimality conditions for directed flow formulations with cohomology over Z+.
  Next, we propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA. Our approach can be extended to validate synthetic networks created for multiple infrastructures such as transportation, communication, water, and gas networks.</description>

      <title>Strictly Self-Assembling Discrete Self-Similar Fractals Using Quines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abstract Tile-Assembly Model (aTAM) was initially introduced as a simple model for DNA-based self-assembly, where synthetic strands of DNA are used not as an information storage medium, but rather a material for nano-scale construction. Since then, it has been shown that the aTAM, and variant models thereof, exhibit rich computational dynamics, Turing completeness, and intrinsic universality, a geometric notion of simulation wherein one aTAM system is able to simulate every other aTAM system not just symbolically, but also geometrically. An intrinsically universal system is able to simulate all other systems within some class so that $m\times m$ blocks of tiles behave in all ways like individual tiles in the system to be simulated. In this paper, we explore the notion of a quine in the aTAM with respect to intrinsic universality. Typically a quine refers to a program which does nothing but print its own description with respect to a Turing universal machine which may interpret that description. In this context, we replace the notion of machine with that of an aTAM system and the notion of Turing universality with that of intrinsic universality. Curiously, we find that doing so results in a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture in the theory of tile-assembly, namely that discrete self-similar fractals (DSSFs), fractal shapes generated via substitution tiling, cannot be strictly self-assembled. We find that by growing an aTAM quine, a tile system which intrinsically simulates itself, DSSF structure is naturally exhibited. This paper describes the construction of such a quine and even shows that essentially any desired fractal dimension between 1 and 2 may be achieved.</description>

      <title>Fully-Adaptive Dynamic Connectivity of Square Intersection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical problem in computational geometry and graph algorithms is: given a dynamic set S of geometric shapes in the plane, efficiently maintain the connectivity of the intersection graph of S. Previous papers studied the setting where, before the updates, the data structure receives some parameter P. Then, updates could insert and delete disks as long as at all times the disks have a diameter that lies in a fixed range [1/P, 1]. The state-of-the-art for storing disks in a dynamic connectivity data structure is a data structure that uses O(Pn) space and that has amortized O(P log^4 n) expected amortized update time. Connectivity queries between disks are supported in O( log n / loglog n) time. The state-of-the-art for Euclidean disks immediately implies a data structure for connectivity between axis-aligned squares that have their diameter in the fixed range [1/P, 1], with an improved update time of O(P log^4 n) amortized time.
  We restrict our attention to axis-aligned squares, and study fully-dynamic square intersection graph connectivity. Our result is fully-adaptive to the aspect ratio, spending time proportional to the current aspect ratio {\psi}, as opposed to some previously given maximum P. Our focus on squares allows us to simplify and streamline the connectivity pipeline from previous work. When $n$ is the number of squares and {\psi} is the aspect ratio after insertion (or before deletion), our data structure answers connectivity queries in O(log n / loglog n) time. We can update connectivity information in O({\psi} log^4 n + log^6 n) amortized time. We also improve space usage from O(P n log n) to O(n log^3 n log {\psi}) -- while generalizing to a fully-adaptive aspect ratio -- which yields a space usage that is near-linear in n for any polynomially bounded {\psi}.</description>

      <title>Efficient Path Planning with Soft Homology Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of path planning with soft homology constraints on a surface topologically equivalent to a disk with punctures. Specifically, we propose an algorithm, named $\Hstar$, for the efficient computation of a path homologous to a user-provided reference path. We show that the algorithm can generate a suite of paths in distinct homology classes, from the overall shortest path to the shortest path homologous to the reference path, ordered both by path length and similarity to the reference path. Rollout is shown to improve the results produced by the algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that $\Hstar$ can be an efficient alternative to optimal methods, especially for configuration spaces with many obstacles.</description>

      <title>Geometric Thickness of Multigraphs is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We say that a (multi)graph $G = (V,E)$ has geometric thickness $t$ if there exists a straight-line drawing $\varphi : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ and a $t$-coloring of its edges where no two edges sharing a point in their relative interior have the same color. The \textsc{Geometric Thickness} problem asks whether a given multigraph has geometric thickness at most $t$. This problem was shown to be NP-hard for $t=2$ [Durocher, Gethner, and Mondal, CG 2016]. In this paper, we settle the computational complexity of \textsc{Geometric Thickness} by showing that it is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete already for thickness $30$. Moreover, our reduction shows that the problem is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete for $4392$-planar graphs, where a graph is $k$-planar if it admits a topological drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge. In the course of our paper, we answer previous questions on geometric thickness and on other related problems, in particular that simultaneous graph embeddings of $31$ edge-disjoint graphs and pseudo-segment stretchability with chromatic number $30$ are $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Robust Classification of Dynamic Bichromatic point Sets in R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R \cup B$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and let $k \in 1..n$. Our goal is to compute a line that "best" separates the "red" points $R$ from the "blue" points $B$ with at most $k$ outliers. We present an efficient semi-online dynamic data structure that can maintain whether such a separator exists. Furthermore, we present efficient exact and approximation algorithms that compute a linear separator that is guaranteed to misclassify at most $k$, points and minimizes the distance to the farthest outlier. Our exact algorithm runs in $O(nk + n \log n)$ time, and our $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm runs in $O(\varepsilon^{-1/2}((n + k^2) \log n))$ time. Based on our $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm we then also obtain a semi-online data structure to maintain such a separator efficiently.</description>
