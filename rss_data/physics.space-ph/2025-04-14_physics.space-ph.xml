      <title>Sunward Flows in the Magnetosheath Associated with Magnetic Pressure Gradient and Magnetosheath Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A density structure within the magnetic cloud of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection impacted Earth and caused significant perturbations in plasma boundaries. We describe the effects of this structure on the magnetosheath plasma downstream of the bow shock using spacecraft observations. During this event, the bow shock breathing motion is evident due to the changes in the upstream dynamic pressure. A magnetic enhancement forms in the inner magnetosheath and ahead of a plasma compression region. The structure has the characteristics of a fast magnetosonic shock wave, propagating earthward and perpendicular to the background magnetic field further accelerating the already heated magnetosheath plasma. Following these events, a sunward motion of the magnetosheath plasma is observed. Ion distributions show that both the high density core population as well as the high energy tail of the distribution have a sunward directed flow indicating that the sunward flows are caused by magnetic field line expansion in the very low $\beta$ magnetosheath plasma. Rarefaction effects and enhancement of the magnetic pressure in the magnetosheath result in magnetic pressure gradient forcing that drives the expansion of magnetosheath magnetic field lines. This picture is supported by a reasonable agreement between the estimated plasma accelerations and the magnetic pressure gradient force.</description>

      <title>Multi-MeV electrons observed by CRRES during solar cycle 22</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) observed the response of the Van Allen radiation belts to peak solar activity within solar cycle 22. This study analyses the occurrence and loss timescales of relativistic electrons within the CRRES High Energy Electron Fluxometer (HEEF) dataset, including during several large geomagnetic storms that flooded the slot region with multi-MeV electrons and which allow the first definitive multi-MeV lifetimes to be calculated in this region. The HEEF loss timescales are otherwise broadly in agreement with those from later solar cycles but differences include longer-lasting sub-MeV electrons near the inner region of the outer belt and faster decaying multi-MeV electrons near geosynchronous orbit. These differences are associated with higher levels of geomagnetic activity, a phenomenon that enables the spread in the results to be parameterised accordingly. The timescales generally appear well-bounded by Kp-dependent theoretical predictions but the variability within the spread is however not always well-ordered by geomagnetic activity. This reveals the limits of pitch-angle diffusion in accounting for the decay of elevated electron fluxes following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Chromospheric Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales is a fundamental driver of energy release and plasma dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere. We present observations of a brightening in an active region, captured in high-resolution data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) using the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The event exhibits Ellerman bomb-like morphology in the H$\beta$ filter, associated with flux cancellation between a small negative polarity patch adjacent to opposite-polarity plage. Additionally, it displays enhanced emissions in Ca II K, hot elongated features containing Alfv\'enic plasma flows, and cooler blue-shifted structures. We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the stratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere. Furthermore, we use the photospheric vector magnetogram inferred from the ViSP spectra as a boundary condition for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of squashing factors. We find significant enhancements in temperature, velocity, and microturbulence confined to the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. Our findings provide observational evidence of low-altitude magnetic reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers in a compact fan-spine-type configuration, highlighting the complex interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma flows.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection &amp; motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.</description>
