      <title>Golden-Retriever: High-Fidelity Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Industrial Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Golden-Retriever, designed to efficiently navigate vast industrial knowledge bases, overcoming challenges in traditional LLM fine-tuning and RAG frameworks with domain-specific jargon and context interpretation. Golden-Retriever incorporates a reflection-based question augmentation step before document retrieval, which involves identifying jargon, clarifying its meaning based on context, and augmenting the question accordingly. Specifically, our method extracts and lists all jargon and abbreviations in the input question, determines the context against a pre-defined list, and queries a jargon dictionary for extended definitions and descriptions. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Evaluations using three open-source LLMs on a domain-specific question-answer dataset demonstrate Golden-Retriever's superior performance, providing a robust solution for efficiently integrating and querying industrial knowledge bases.</description>

      <title>Deep Uncertainty-based explore For Index Construction and Retrieval in Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, the relevance and novelty of the final results are selected through a cascade system of Matching -&gt; Ranking -&gt; Strategy. The matching model serves as the starting point of the pipeline and determines the upper bound of the subsequent stages. Balancing the relevance and novelty of matching results is a crucial step in the design and optimization of recommendation systems, contributing significantly to improving recommendation quality. However, the typical matching algorithms have not simultaneously addressed the relevance and novelty perfectly. One main reason is that deep matching algorithms exhibit significant uncertainty when estimating items in the long tail (e.g., due to insufficient training samples) items.The uncertainty not only affects the training of the models but also influences the confidence in the index construction and beam search retrieval process of these models. This paper proposes the UICR (Uncertainty-based explore for Index Construction and Retrieval) algorithm, which introduces the concept of uncertainty modeling in the matching stage and achieves multi-task modeling of model uncertainty and index uncertainty. The final matching results are obtained by combining the relevance score and uncertainty score infered by the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the UICR improves novelty without sacrificing relevance on realworld industrial productive environments and multiple open-source datasets. Remarkably, online A/B test results of display advertising in Shopee demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Chatbot-Based Ontology Interaction Using Large Language Models and Domain-Specific Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following contribution introduces a concept that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) and a chatbot interface to enhance SPARQL query generation for ontologies, thereby facilitating intuitive access to formalized knowledge. Utilizing natural language inputs, the system converts user inquiries into accurate SPARQL queries that strictly query the factual content of the ontology, effectively preventing misinformation or fabrication by the LLM. To enhance the quality and precision of outcomes, additional textual information from established domain-specific standards is integrated into the ontology for precise descriptions of its concepts and relationships. An experimental study assesses the accuracy of generated SPARQL queries, revealing significant benefits of using LLMs for querying ontologies and highlighting areas for future research.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Field-Weighted Factorization Machines for Low Latency Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factorization machine (FM) variants are widely used in recommendation systems that operate under strict throughput and latency requirements, such as online advertising systems. FMs are known both due to their ability to model pairwise feature interactions while being resilient to data sparsity, and their computational graphs that facilitate fast inference and training. Moreover, when items are ranked as a part of a query for each incoming user, these graphs facilitate computing the portion stemming from the user and context fields only once per query. Consequently, in terms of inference cost, the number of user or context fields is practically unlimited. More advanced FM variants, such as FwFM, provide better accuracy by learning a representation of field-wise interactions, but require computing all pairwise interaction terms explicitly. The computational cost during inference is proportional to the square of the number of fields, including user, context, and item. When the number of fields is large, this is prohibitive in systems with strict latency constraints. To mitigate this caveat, heuristic pruning of low intensity field interactions is commonly used to accelerate inference. In this work we propose an alternative to the pruning heuristic in FwFMs using a diagonal plus symmetric low-rank decomposition. Our technique reduces the computational cost of inference, by allowing it to be proportional to the number of item fields only. Using a set of experiments on real-world datasets, we show that aggressive rank reduction outperforms similarly aggressive pruning, both in terms of accuracy and item recommendation speed. We corroborate our claim of faster inference experimentally, both via a synthetic test, and by having deployed our solution to a major online advertising system. The code to reproduce our experimental results is at https://github.com/michaelviderman/pytorch-fm/tree/dev.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLM Reasoning Enhances Personalized Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have showcased the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in executing reasoning tasks, particularly facilitated by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. While tasks like arithmetic reasoning involve clear, definitive answers and logical chains of thought, the application of LLM reasoning in recommendation systems (RecSys) presents a distinct challenge. RecSys tasks revolve around subjectivity and personalized preferences, an under-explored domain in utilizing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our study explores several aspects to better understand reasoning for RecSys and demonstrate how task quality improves by utilizing LLM reasoning in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Additionally, we propose RecSAVER (Recommender Systems Automatic Verification and Evaluation of Reasoning) to automatically assess the quality of LLM reasoning responses without the requirement of curated gold references or human raters. We show that our framework aligns with real human judgment on the coherence and faithfulness of reasoning responses. Overall, our work shows that incorporating reasoning into RecSys can improve personalized tasks, paving the way for further advancements in recommender system methodologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Aspect Reviewed-Item Retrieval via LLM Query Decomposition and Aspect Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While user-generated product reviews often contain large quantities of information, their utility in addressing natural language product queries has been limited, with a key challenge being the need to aggregate information from multiple low-level sources (reviews) to a higher item level during retrieval. Existing methods for reviewed-item retrieval (RIR) typically take a late fusion (LF) approach which computes query-item scores by simply averaging the top-K query-review similarity scores for an item. However, we demonstrate that for multi-aspect queries and multi-aspect items, LF is highly sensitive to the distribution of aspects covered by reviews in terms of aspect frequency and the degree of aspect separation across reviews. To address these LF failures, we propose several novel aspect fusion (AF) strategies which include Large Language Model (LLM) query extraction and generative reranking. Our experiments show that for imbalanced review corpora, AF can improve over LF by a MAP@10 increase from 0.36 to 0.52, while achieving equivalent performance for balanced review corpora.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Knowledge Graph Embedding for Effective Conversational Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender system (CRS), which combines the techniques of dialogue system and recommender system, has obtained increasing interest recently. In contrast to traditional recommender system, it learns the user preference better through interactions (i.e. conversations), and then further boosts the recommendation performance. However, existing studies on CRS ignore to address the relationship among attributes, users, and items effectively, which might lead to inappropriate questions and inaccurate recommendations. In this view, we propose a knowledge graph based conversational recommender system (referred as KG-CRS). Specifically, we first integrate the user-item graph and item-attribute graph into a dynamic graph, i.e., dynamically changing during the dialogue process by removing negative items or attributes. We then learn informative embedding of users, items, and attributes by also considering propagation through neighbors on the graph. Extensive experiments on three real datasets validate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both the recommendation and conversation tasks.</description>

      <title>Toward Automatic Relevance Judgment using Vision--Language Models for Image--Text Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated success across diverse applications, yet their potential to assist in relevance judgments remains uncertain. This paper assesses the relevance estimation capabilities of VLMs, including CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, within a large-scale \textit{ad hoc} retrieval task tailored for multimedia content creation in a zero-shot fashion. Preliminary experiments reveal the following: (1) Both LLaVA and GPT-4V, encompassing open-source and closed-source visual-instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), achieve notable Kendall's $\tau \sim 0.4$ when compared to human relevance judgments, surpassing the CLIPScore metric. (2) While CLIPScore is strongly preferred, LLMs are less biased towards CLIP-based retrieval systems. (3) GPT-4V's score distribution aligns more closely with human judgments than other models, achieving a Cohen's $\kappa$ value of around 0.08, which outperforms CLIPScore at approximately -0.096. These findings underscore the potential of LLM-powered VLMs in enhancing relevance judgments.</description>

      <title>LICM: Effective and Efficient Long Interest Chain Modeling for News Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately recommending personalized candidate news articles to users has always been the core challenge of news recommendation system. News recommendations often require modeling of user interests to match candidate news. Recent efforts have primarily focused on extract local subgraph information, the lack of a comprehensive global news graph extraction has hindered the ability to utilize global news information collaboratively among similar users. To overcome these limitations, we propose an effective and efficient Long Interest Chain Modeling for News Recommendation(LICM), which combines neighbor interest with long-chain interest distilled from a global news click graph based on the collaborative of similar users to enhance news recommendation. For a global news graph based on the click history of all users, long chain interest generated from it can better utilize the high-dimensional information within it, enhancing the effectiveness of collaborative recommendations. We therefore design a comprehensive selection mechanism and interest encoder to obtain long-chain interest from the global graph. Finally, we use a gated network to integrate long-chain information with neighbor information to achieve the final user representation. Experiment results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model to improve the performance of news recommendation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nuances of a user's extensive interaction history is key to building accurate and personalized natural language systems that can adapt to evolving user preferences. To address this, we introduce PERSOMA, Personalized Soft Prompt Adapter architecture. Unlike previous personalized prompting methods for large language models, PERSOMA offers a novel approach to efficiently capture user history. It achieves this by resampling and compressing interactions as free form text into expressive soft prompt embeddings, building upon recent research utilizing embedding representations as input for LLMs. We rigorously validate our approach by evaluating various adapter architectures, first-stage sampling strategies, parameter-efficient tuning techniques like LoRA, and other personalization methods. Our results demonstrate PERSOMA's superior ability to handle large and complex user histories compared to existing embedding-based and text-prompt-based techniques.</description>

      <title>An Encoding--Searching Separation Perspective on Bi-Encoder Neural Search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews, analyzes, and proposes a new perspective on the bi-encoder architecture for neural search. While the bi-encoder architecture is widely used due to its simplicity and scalability at test time, it has some notable issues such as low performance on seen datasets and weak zero-shot performance on new datasets. In this paper, we analyze these issues and summarize two main critiques: the encoding information bottleneck problem and limitations of the basic assumption of embedding search. We then construct a thought experiment to logically analyze the encoding and searching operations and challenge the basic assumption of embedding search. Building on these observations, we propose a new perspective on the bi-encoder architecture called the \textit{encoding--searching separation} perspective, which conceptually and practically separates the encoding and searching operations. This new perspective is applied to explain the root cause of the identified issues and discuss ways to mitigate the problems. Finally, we discuss the implications of the ideas underlying the new perspective, the design surface that it exposes and the potential research directions arising from it.</description>

      <title>BioRAG: A RAG-LLM Framework for Biological Question Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question-answering system for Life science research, which is characterized by the rapid pace of discovery, evolving insights, and complex interactions among knowledge entities, presents unique challenges in maintaining a comprehensive knowledge warehouse and accurate information retrieval. To address these issues, we introduce BioRAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the Large Language Models (LLMs) framework. Our approach starts with parsing, indexing, and segmenting an extensive collection of 22 million scientific papers as the basic knowledge, followed by training a specialized embedding model tailored to this domain. Additionally, we enhance the vector retrieval process by incorporating a domain-specific knowledge hierarchy, which aids in modeling the intricate interrelationships among each query and context. For queries requiring the most current information, BioRAG deconstructs the question and employs an iterative retrieval process incorporated with the search engine for step-by-step reasoning. Rigorous experiments have demonstrated that our model outperforms fine-tuned LLM, LLM with search engines, and other scientific RAG frameworks across multiple life science question-answering tasks.</description>

      <title>Nested Music Transformer: Sequentially Decoding Compound Tokens in Symbolic Music and Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing symbolic music with compound tokens, where each token consists of several different sub-tokens representing a distinct musical feature or attribute, offers the advantage of reducing sequence length. While previous research has validated the efficacy of compound tokens in music sequence modeling, predicting all sub-tokens simultaneously can lead to suboptimal results as it may not fully capture the interdependencies between them. We introduce the Nested Music Transformer (NMT), an architecture tailored for decoding compound tokens autoregressively, similar to processing flattened tokens, but with low memory usage. The NMT consists of two transformers: the main decoder that models a sequence of compound tokens and the sub-decoder for modeling sub-tokens of each compound token. The experiment results showed that applying the NMT to compound tokens can enhance the performance in terms of better perplexity in processing various symbolic music datasets and discrete audio tokens from the MAESTRO dataset.</description>

      <title>RAGEval: Scenario Specific RAG Evaluation Dataset Generation Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated their advantages in alleviating the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing RAG benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating whether LLMs can correctly answer the general knowledge. However, they are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of the RAG system in dealing with the data from different vertical domains. This paper introduces RAGEval, a framework for automatically generating evaluation datasets to evaluate the knowledge usage ability of different LLMs in different scenarios. Specifically, RAGEval summarizes a schema from seed documents, applies the configurations to generate diverse documents, and constructs question-answering pairs according to both articles and configurations. We propose three novel metrics, Completeness, Hallucination, and Irrelevance, to carefully evaluate the responses generated by LLMs. By benchmarking RAG models in vertical domains, RAGEval has the ability to better evaluate the knowledge usage ability of LLMs, which avoids the confusion regarding the source of knowledge in answering question in existing QA datasets--whether it comes from parameterized memory or retrieval.</description>

      <title>PC$^2$: Pseudo-Classification Based Pseudo-Captioning for Noisy Correspondence Learning in Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of cross-modal retrieval, seamlessly integrating diverse modalities within multimedia remains a formidable challenge, especially given the complexities introduced by noisy correspondence learning (NCL). Such noise often stems from mismatched data pairs, which is a significant obstacle distinct from traditional noisy labels. This paper introduces Pseudo-Classification based Pseudo-Captioning (PC$^2$) framework to address this challenge. PC$^2$ offers a threefold strategy: firstly, it establishes an auxiliary "pseudo-classification" task that interprets captions as categorical labels, steering the model to learn image-text semantic similarity through a non-contrastive mechanism. Secondly, unlike prevailing margin-based techniques, capitalizing on PC$^2$'s pseudo-classification capability, we generate pseudo-captions to provide more informative and tangible supervision for each mismatched pair. Thirdly, the oscillation of pseudo-classification is borrowed to assistant the correction of correspondence. In addition to technical contributions, we develop a realistic NCL dataset called Noise of Web (NoW), which could be a new powerful NCL benchmark where noise exists naturally. Empirical evaluations of PC$^2$ showcase marked improvements over existing state-of-the-art robust cross-modal retrieval techniques on both simulated and realistic datasets with various NCL settings. The contributed dataset and source code are released at https://github.com/alipay/PC2-NoiseofWeb.</description>

Abstract: An increasingly important aspect of designing recommender systems involves considering how recommendations will influence consumer choices. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a method for collecting user beliefs about un-experienced items - a critical predictor of choice behavior. We implemented this method on the MovieLens platform, resulting in a rich dataset that combines user ratings, beliefs, and observed recommendations. We document challenges to such data collection, including selection bias in response and limited coverage of the product space. This unique resource empowers researchers to delve deeper into user behavior and analyze user choices absent recommendations, measure the effectiveness of recommendations, and prototype algorithms that leverage user belief data, ultimately leading to more impactful recommender systems. The dataset can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml_belief_2024/.</description>
