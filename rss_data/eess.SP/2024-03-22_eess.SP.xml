      <title>Maximum Likelihood Alternating Summation for Multistatic Angle-based Multitarget Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Wi-Fi sensing have sparked interest in exploiting OFDM modulated communication signals for target detection and tracking. In this study, we address the angle-based localization of multiple targets using a multistatic OFDM radar. While the maximum likelihood approach optimally merges data from each radar pair comprised by the system, it entails a complex multi-dimensional search process. Leveraging pre-estimation of the targets' parameters obtained via the MUSIC algorithm, our method decouples this multi-dimensional search into a single two-dimensional estimator per target. The proposed alternating summation method allows the computation of a combined likelihood map aggregating contributions from each radar pair, enabling target detection via peak selection. Besides reducing computational complexity, the method effectively captures target interactions and accommodates varying radar pair localization abilities. Also, it requires transmitting only the estimated channel covariance matrices of each radar pair to the central processor. Numerical simulations demonstrate superior performance over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Sub-Nyquist Sampling OFDM Radar With a Time-Frequency Phase-Coded Waveform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a time-frequency phase-coded sub-Nyquist sampling orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (PC-SNS-OFDM) radar system to reduce the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling rate without any additional hardware or signal processing. The proposed radar divides the transmitted OFDM signal into multiple sub-bands along the frequency axis and provides orthogonality to these sub-bands by multiplying phase codes in both the time and frequency domains. Although the sampling rate is reduced by the factor of the number of sub-bands, the sub-bands above the sampling rate are folded into the lowest one due to aliasing. In the process of restoring the signals in folded sub-bands to those in full signal bands, the proposed PC-SNS-OFDM radar effectively eliminates symbol-mismatch noise while introducing trade-offs in the range and Doppler ambiguities. The utilization of phase codes in both the frequency and time domains provides flexible control of the range and Doppler ambiguities. It also improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detected targets compared to an earlier sub-Nyquist sampling OFDM radar system. This is validated with simulations and experiments under various sub-Nyquist sampling rates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Target Detection for FDA-MIMO Radar with Training Data in Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of detecting a moving target embedded in Gaussian noise with an unknown covariance matrix for frequency diverse array multiple-input multiple-output (FDA-MIMO) radar. To end it, assume that obtaining a set of training data is available. Moreover, we propose three adaptive detectors in accordance with the one-step generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), two-step GLRT, and Rao criteria, namely OGLRT, TGLRT, and Rao. The LH adaptive matched filter (LHAMF) detector is also introduced when decomposing the Rao test. Next, all provided detectors have constant false alarm rate (CFAR) properties against the covariance matrix. Besides, the closed-form expressions for false alarm probability (PFA) and detection probability (PD) are derived. Finally, this paper substantiates the correctness of the aforementioned algorithms through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A LiDAR-Aided Channel Model for Vehicular Intelligent Sensing-Communication Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel channel modeling approach, named light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-aided geometry-based stochastic modeling (LA-GBSM), is developed. Based on the developed LA-GBSM approach, a new millimeter wave (mmWave) channel model for sixth-generation (6G) vehicular intelligent sensing-communication integration is proposed, which can support the design of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). The proposed LA-GBSM is accurately parameterized under high, medium, and low vehicular traffic density (VTD) conditions via a sensing-communication simulation dataset with LiDAR point clouds and scatterer information for the first time. Specifically, by detecting dynamic vehicles and static building/tress through LiDAR point clouds via machine learning, scatterers are divided into static and dynamic scatterers. Furthermore, statistical distributions of parameters, e.g., distance, angle, number, and power, related to static and dynamic scatterers are quantified under high, medium, and low VTD conditions. To mimic channel non-stationarity and consistency, based on the quantified statistical distributions, a new visibility region (VR)-based algorithm in consideration of newly generated static/dynamic scatterers is developed. Key channel statistics are derived and simulated. By comparing simulation results and ray-tracing (RT)-based results, the utility of the proposed LA-GBSM is verified.</description>

      <title>Learning-to-Learn the Wave Angle Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise incident wave angle estimation in aerial communication is a key enabler in sixth-generation wireless communication network. With this goal, a generic 3-dimensional (3D) channel model is analyzed for air-to-air (A2A) networks under antenna misalignment, radio frequency impairments and polarization loss. The unique aspects of each aerial node are highlighted and the few-shot learning as a model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) classifier is proposed for learning-to-learn (L2L) incident wave angle estimation by utilizing the received signal strength (RSS). Additionally, a more computationally efficient technique, first order model agnostic meta-learning (FOMAML) is implemented. It has been observed that the proposed approach reaches up to 85% training accuracy and 75.4% evaluation accuracy with MAML. Regarding this, a convergence rate and accuracy trade-off have been established for several cases of MAML and FOMAML. For different L2L models trained with limited data, heuristic accuracy performance is determined by an upper bound of the probability of confidence.</description>

      <title>Modem Optimization of High-Mobility Scenarios: A Deep-Learning-Inspired Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation wireless communication networks are required to support high-mobility scenarios, such as reliable data transmission for high-speed railways. Nevertheless, widely utilized multi-carrier modulation, the orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM), cannot deal with the severe Doppler spread brought by high mobility. To address this problem, some new modulation schemes, e.g. orthogonal time frequency space and affine frequency division multiplexing, have been proposed with different design criteria from OFDM, which promote reliability with the cost of extremely high implementation complexity. On the other hand, end-to-end systems achieve excellent gains by exploiting neural networks to replace traditional transmitters and receivers, but have to retrain and update continually with channel varying. In this paper, we propose the Modem Network (ModNet) to design a novel modem scheme. Compared with end-to-end systems, channels are directly fed into the network and we can directly get a modem scheme through ModNet. Then, the Tri-Phase training strategy is proposed, which mainly utilizes the siamese structure to unify the learned modem scheme without retraining frequently faced up with time-varying channels. Simulation results show the proposed modem scheme outperforms OFDM systems under different highmobility channel statistics.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Rate Splitting Precoding Approach in Multi-User MISO FDD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an efficient precoding strategy for a multi-user multiple-input-single output (MU MISO) system operating in frequency-division-duplex (FDD) mode, where rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is implemented. To this end, we consider one-layer RS and show its significant impact on the system performance, specifically in the case where the channel state information (CSI) is incomplete at the transmitter. Based on a lower bound on the achievable rate that takes into account the CSI errors, we establish an augmented weighted average mean squared error (AWAMSE) algorithm for the RS setup denoted by AWAMSE-RS, where even the updates for the common and the private precoders are computed via analytical expressions, hence circumventing the need for interior-point methods. Simulation results validate the efficiency of our approach in terms of computational time and its competitiveness in terms of the achievable system throughput compared to state-of-the-art methods and non-RS setups.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Doppler Frequency Estimation with Asynchronous Moving Devices for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present for the first time a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target with clock asynchronous and mobile Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) devices. Existing approaches have separately tackled the presence of phase offsets due to clock asynchrony or the additional Doppler shift due to device movement. However, in real ISAC scenarios, these two sources of phase nuisance are concurrently present, making the estimation of the target's Doppler frequency particularly challenging. Our method solves the problem using the sole wireless signal at the receiver, by computing Channel Impulse Response (CIR) phase differences across different multipath components and subsequent time instants. In this way, we cancel out phase offsets. Then, we construct a system of equations that allows disentangling the target's Doppler frequency from that of the moving device. The proposed method is validated via simulation, exploring the impact of different system parameters. Numerical results show that our approach is a viable way of estimating Doppler frequency in bistatic asynchronous ISAC scenarios with mobile devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamentals of MIMO communications and MIMO sensing are firstly analyzed with regard to channel and sensing capacities. It is shown that the different objectives of communications and sensing lead to different signaling waveforms required for achieving their capacities. Hence, the optimization of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is relied on a trade-off expected between the performance of communications and that of sensing. Following this observation, the design and resource optimization in general MIMO ISAC systems are discussed along with the analysis of some existing ISAC schemes. Furthermore, the design of ISAC in mmWave communications is addressed. Specifically, the principle of sensing in mmWave systems is established, and a range of optimization alternatives for ISAC design in mmWave systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Path Planning in UAV-aided Wireless Networks based on Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel self-supervised path-planning method for UAV-aided networks. First, we employed an optimizer to solve training examples offline and then used the resulting solutions as demonstrations from which the UAV can learn the world model to understand the environment and implicitly discover the optimizer's policy. UAV equipped with the world model can make real-time autonomous decisions and engage in online planning using active inference. During planning, UAV can score different policies based on the expected surprise, allowing it to choose among alternative futures. Additionally, UAV can anticipate the outcomes of its actions using the world model and assess the expected surprise in a self-supervised manner. Our method enables quicker adaptation to new situations and better performance than traditional RL, leading to broader generalizability.</description>

      <title>Advancing IIoT with Over-the-Air Federated Learning: The Role of Iterative Magnitude Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) under Industry 4.0 heralds an era of interconnected smart devices where data-driven insights and machine learning (ML) fuse to revolutionize manufacturing. A noteworthy development in IIoT is the integration of federated learning (FL), which addresses data privacy and security among devices. FL enables edge sensors, also known as peripheral intelligence units (PIUs) to learn and adapt using their data locally, without explicit sharing of confidential data, to facilitate a collaborative yet confidential learning process. However, the lower memory footprint and computational power of PIUs inherently require deep neural network (DNN) models that have a very compact size. Model compression techniques such as pruning can be used to reduce the size of DNN models by removing unnecessary connections that have little impact on the model's performance, thus making the models more suitable for the limited resources of PIUs. Targeting the notion of compact yet robust DNN models, we propose the integration of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) of the DNN model being trained in an over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) environment for IIoT. We provide a tutorial overview and also present a case study of the effectiveness of IMP in OTA-FL for an IIoT environment. Finally, we present future directions for enhancing and optimizing these deep compression techniques further, aiming to push the boundaries of IIoT capabilities in acquiring compact yet robust and high-performing DNN models.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Delay-Doppler Communications: Practical Implementation and Extensions to OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, which is a typical Delay-Doppler (DD) communication scheme, has attracted significant attention thanks to its appealing performance over doubly-selective channels. In this paper, we present the fundamentals of general DD communications from the viewpoint of the Zak transform. We start our study by constructing DD domain basis functions aligning with the time-frequency (TF)-consistency condition, which are globally quasi-periodic and locally twisted-shifted. We unveil that these features are translated to unique signal structures in both time and frequency, which are beneficial for communication purposes. Then, we focus on the practical implementations of DD Nyquist communications, where we show that rectangular windows achieve perfect DD orthogonality, while truncated periodic signals can obtain sufficient DD orthogonality. Particularly, smoothed rectangular window with excess bandwidth can result in a slightly worse orthogonality but better pulse localization in the DD domain. Furthermore, we present a practical pulse shaping framework for general DD communications and derive the corresponding input-output relation under various shaping pulses. Our numerical results agree with our derivations and also demonstrate advantages of DD communications over conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM).</description>

      <title>Time-Synchronized Full System State Estimation Considering Practical Implementation Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem involves a cost-benefit trade-off, more PMUs get placed on the higher voltage buses. However, this causes many of the lower voltage levels of the bulk power system to not be observed by PMUs. This lack of visibility then makes time-synchronized state estimation of the full system a challenging problem. We propose a Deep Neural network-based State Estimator (DeNSE) to overcome this problem. The DeNSE employs a Bayesian framework to indirectly combine inferences drawn from slow timescale but widespread supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data with fast timescale but select PMU data to attain sub-second situational awareness of the entire system. The practical utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by considering topology changes, non-Gaussian measurement noise, and bad data detection and correction. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system show the superiority of the DeNSE over a purely SCADA state estimator and a PMU-only linear state estimator from a techno-economic viability perspective. Lastly, scalability of the DeNSE is proven by estimating the states of a large and realistic 2000-bus Synthetic Texas system.</description>

      <title>Event Encryption: Rethinking Privacy Exposure for Neuromorphic Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bio-inspired neuromorphic cameras sense illumination changes on a per-pixel basis and generate spatiotemporal streaming events within microseconds in response, offering visual information with high temporal resolution over a high dynamic range. Such devices often serve in surveillance systems due to their applicability and robustness in environments with high dynamics and harsh lighting, where they can still supply clearer recordings than traditional imaging. In other words, when it comes to privacy-relevant cases, neuromorphic cameras also expose more sensitive data and pose serious security threats. Therefore, asynchronous event streams necessitate careful encryption before transmission and usage. This work discusses several potential attack scenarios and approaches event encryption from the perspective of neuromorphic noise removal, in which we inversely introduce well-crafted noise into raw events until they are obfuscated. Our evaluations show that the encrypted events can effectively protect information from attacks of low-level visual reconstruction and high-level neuromorphic reasoning, and thus feature dependable privacy-preserving competence. The proposed solution gives impetus to the security of event data and paves the way to a highly encrypted technique for privacy-protective neuromorphic imaging.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hybrid Active-Passive RIS-Aided MEC Systems: From the Mode-Switching Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technique to support latencysensitivity and computation-intensive serves. However, the low offloading rate caused by the random channel fading characteristic becomes a major bottleneck in restricting the performance of the MEC. Fortunately, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can alleviate this problem since it can boost both the spectrum- and energy- efficiency. Different from the existing works adopting either fully active or fully passive RIS, we propose a novel hybrid RIS in which reflecting units can flexibly switch between active and passive modes. To achieve a tradeoff between the latency and energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated by minimizing the total cost. In light of the intractability of the problem, we develop an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm by combining the successive convex approximation method, the variable substitution, and the singular value decomposition (SVD) to obtain sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, in order to gain more insight into the problem, we consider two special cases involving a latency minimization problem and an energy consumption minimization problem, and respectively analyze the tradeoff between the number of active and passive units. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve flexible mode switching and significantly outperforms existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Real-time Graph Building on FPGAs for Machine Learning Trigger Applications in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a design methodology that enables the semi-automatic generation of a hardware-accelerated graph building architectures for locally constrained graphs based on formally described detector definitions. In addition, we define a similarity measure in order to compare our locally constrained graph building approaches with commonly used k-nearest neighbour building approaches. To demonstrate the feasibility of our solution for particle physics applications, we implemented a real-time graph building approach in a case study for the Belle~II central drift chamber using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays~(FPGAs). Our presented solution adheres to all throughput and latency constraints currently present in the hardware-based trigger of the Belle~II experiment. We achieve constant time complexity at the expense of linear space complexity and thus prove that our automated methodology generates online graph building designs suitable for a wide range of particle physics applications. By enabling an hardware-accelerated pre-processing of graphs, we enable the deployment of novel Graph Neural Networks~(GNNs) in first level triggers of particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Constellation Shaping under Phase Noise Impairment for Sub-THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large untapped spectrum in the sub-THz allows for ultra-high throughput communication to realize many seemingly impossible applications in 6G. One of the challenges in radio communications in sub-THz is the hardware impairments. Specifically, phase noise is one key hardware impairment, which is accentuated as we increase the frequency and bandwidth. Furthermore, the moderate output power of the sub-THz power amplifier demands limits on peak to average power ratio (PAPR) signal design. Single carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) has been identified as a suitable candidate for sub-THz, although some challenges such as phase noise and PAPR still remain to be tackled. In this work, we design a phase noise robust, modest PAPR SC waveform by geometrically shaping the constellation under practical conditions. We formulate the waveform optimization problem in its augmented Lagrangian form and use a back-propagation-inspired technique to obtain a constellation design that is numerically robust to phase noise, while maintaining a relatively low PAPR compared to the conventional waveforms.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Causal Inference for Analyzing Wearable, Sensor, and Distributional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern causal questions ask how treatments affect complex outcomes that are measured using wearable devices and sensors. Current analysis approaches require summarizing these data into scalar statistics (e.g., the mean), but these summaries can be misleading. For example, disparate distributions can have the same means, variances, and other statistics. Researchers can overcome the loss of information by instead representing the data as distributions. We develop an interpretable method for distributional data analysis that ensures trustworthy and robust decision-making: Analyzing Distributional Data via Matching After Learning to Stretch (ADD MALTS). We (i) provide analytical guarantees of the correctness of our estimation strategy, (ii) demonstrate via simulation that ADD MALTS outperforms other distributional data analysis methods at estimating treatment effects, and (iii) illustrate ADD MALTS' ability to verify whether there is enough cohesion between treatment and control units within subpopulations to trustworthily estimate treatment effects. We demonstrate ADD MALTS' utility by studying the effectiveness of continuous glucose monitors in mitigating diabetes risks.</description>

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a new, more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging point prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions and heralding a new era in object counting technology.</description>
