      <title>Sufficiently many projections in archimedean vector lattices with weak order unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The property of a vector lattice of sufficiently many projections (SMP) is informed by restricting attention to archimedean $A$ with a distinguished weak order unit $u$ (the class, or category, $\bf{W}$), where the Yosida representation $A \leq D(Y(A,u))$ is available. Here, $A$ SMP is equivalent to $Y(A,u)$ having a $\pi$-base of clopen sets of a certain type called ``local". If the unit is strong, all clopen sets are local and $A$ is SMP if and only if $Y(A,u)$ has clopen $\pi$-base, a property we call $\pi$-zero-dimensional ($\pi$ZD). The paper is in two parts: the first explicates the similarities of SMP and $\pi$ZD; the second consists of examples, including $\pi$ZD but not SMP, and constructions of many SMP's which seem scarce in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Few Projective Classes of (Non-Hausdorff) Topological Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of topological spaces is projective (resp., $\omega$-projective) if and only if projective systems of spaces (resp., with a countable cofinal subset of indices) in the class are still in the class. A certain number of classes of Hausdorff spaces are known to be, or not to be, ($\omega$-) projective. We examine classes of spaces that are not necessarily Hausdorff. Sober and compact sober spaces form projective classes, but most classes of locally compact spaces are not even $\omega$-projective. Guided by the fact that the stably compact spaces are exactly the locally compact, strongly sober spaces, and that the strongly sober spaces are exactly the sober, coherent, compact, weakly Hausdorff (in the sense of Keimel and Lawson) spaces, we examine which classes defined by combinations of those properties are projective. Notably, we find that coherent sober spaces, compact coherent sober spaces, as well as (locally) strongly sober spaces, form projective classes.</description>

      <title>Canonical extensions via fitted sublocales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on a recent result stating that the frame $\mathsf{SE}(L)$ of strongly exact filters for a frame $L$ is anti-isomorphic to the coframe $\mathsf{S}_o(L)$ of fitted sublocales. The collection $\mathsf{E}(L)$ of exact filters of $L$ is known to be a sublocale of this frame. We consider several other subcollections of $\mathsf{SE}(L)$: the collections $\mathcal{J}(\mathsf{CP}(L))$ and $\mathcal{J}(\mathsf{SO}(L))$ of intersections of completely prime and Scott-open filters, respectively, and the collection $\mathsf{R}(L)$ of regular elements of the frame of filters. We show that all of these are sublocales of $\mathsf{SE}(L)$, and as such they correspond to subcolocales of $\mathsf{S}_o(L)$, which all turn out to have a concise description. By using the theory of polarities of Birkhoff, one can show that all of the structures mentioned above enjoy universal properties which are variations of that of the canonical extension. We also show how some of these subcollections can be described as polarities and give three new equivalent definitions of subfitness in terms of the lattice of filters.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of the projection bands and some order properties of the lattices of continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for an ideal $H$ in an Archimedean vector lattice $F$ the following conditions are equivalent:
  $\bullet$ $H$ is a projection band;
  $\bullet$ Any collection of mutually disjoint vectors in $H$, which is order bounded in $F$, is order bounded in $H$;
  $\bullet$ $H$ is an infinite meet-distributive element of the lattice $\mathcal{I}_{F}$ of all ideals in $F$ in the sense that $\bigcap\limits_{J\in \mathcal{J}}\left(H+ J\right)=H+ \bigcap \mathcal{J}$, for any $\mathcal{J}\subset \mathcal{I}_{F}$.
  Additionally, we show that if $F$ is uniformly complete and $H$ is a uniformly closed principal ideal, then $H$ is a projection band. In the process we investigate some order properties of lattices of continuous functions on Tychonoff topological spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the consistency of the existence of a $Q$-set whose square is not a $\Delta$-set and that if there is a $\Delta$-set, then there exists a $\Delta$-set whose all finite powers are $\Delta$-sets.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of open and semi-open maps of compact Hausdorff spaces by induced maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f\colon X\rightarrow Y$ be a continuous surjection of compact Hausdorff spaces. By $$f_*\colon\mathfrak{M}(X)\rightarrow\mathfrak{M}(Y),\ \mu\mapsto \mu\circ f^{-1} \quad{\rm and}\quad 2^f\colon2^X\rightarrow2^Y,\ A\mapsto f[A]$$ we denote the induced continuous surjections on the probability measure spaces and hyperspaces, respectively. In this paper we mainly show the following facts:
  (1) If $f_*$ is semi-open, then $f$ is semi-open.
  (2) If $f$ is semi-open densely open, then $f_*$ is semi-open densely open.
  (3) $f$ is open iff $2^f$ is open.
  (4) $f$ is semi-open iff $2^f$ is semi-open.
  (5) $f$ is irreducible iff $2^f$ is irreducible.</description>
