      <title>The Epoch of Giant Planet Migration Planet Search Program. III. The Occurrence Rate of Young Giant Planets Inside the Water Ice Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present statistical results from the Epoch of Giant Planet Migration RV planet search program. This survey was designed to measure the occurrence rate of giant planets interior to the water ice line of young Sun-like stars, compare this to the prevalence of giant planets at older ages, and provide constraints on the timescale and dominant inward migration mechanism of giant planets. Our final sample amounts to 85 single young (20-200 Myr) G and K dwarfs which we target across a 4-year time baseline with the near-infrared Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope. As part of this survey, we discovered the young hot Jupiter HS Psc b. We characterize survey detection completeness with realistic injection-recovery tests and measure an occurrence rate of $1.9^{+2.6}_{-1.4}$% for intermediate-age giant planets ($0.3 &lt; m \; sin \; i &lt; 13$ $M_\mathrm{Jup}$) within 2.5 AU. This is lower than the field age occurrence rate for the same planet masses and separations and favors an increase in the prevalence of giant planets over time from $\sim$100 Myr to several Gyr, although our results cannot rule out a constant rate. A decaying planet occurrence rate is, however, strongly excluded. This suggests that giant planets located inside the water ice line originate from a combination of in situ formation or early migration coupled with longer-term inward scattering. The completeness-corrected prevalence of young hot Jupiters in our sample is $1.5^{+2.2}_{-1.1}$%--similar to the rate for field stars--and the 95% upper limit for young brown dwarfs within 5000 d is $&lt;$3.6%.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal Scattering Efficiency of Cold Giant Planet Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of many exoplanets has revealed an incredible diversity of orbital architectures. These orbital configurations are intrinsically linked to the potential for habitable environments within the system, since the gravitational influence of the planets governs the angular momentum distribution within the system. This angular momentum distribution, in turn, alters the planetary orbits and rotational obliquities. In the case of giant planets, their gravitational influence can also produce significant redistribution of volatiles, particularly those that lie beyond the snow line. Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations that investigate the role of cold giant planets in scattering material to inner terrestrial planets. We highlight 10 exoplanetary systems with 2 or more known giant planets beyond the snow line, and adopt a solar system analog template that investigates the scattering of material within the range 3-8~AU. We show that increasing the eccentricity of a Jupiter analog from its present, near-circular, value to a moderate range (0.2-0.3) results in an order of magnitude increase in scattered material to the inner part of the system. The inclusion of a Saturn analog to the dynamical model produces a similar increase, highlighting the importance of multiple giant planets beyond the snow line. However, the addition of analogs to Uranus and Neptune can have a minor negative effect on scattering efficiency through the transfer of angular momentum from the inner giant planets.</description>

      <title>Constraining Ongoing Volcanic Outgassing Rates and Interior Compositions of Extrasolar Planets with Mass Measurements of Plasma Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method of constraining volcanic activity on extrasolar terrestrial worlds via characterization of circumstellar plasma tori. Our work generalizes the physics of the Io plasma torus to propose a hypothetical circumstellar plasma torus generated by exoplanetary volcanism. The quasi-steady torus mass is determined by a balance between material injection and ejection rates from volcanic activity and corotating magnetospheric convection, respectively. By estimating the Alfv\'en surfaces of planet-hosting stars, we calculate the torus mass-removal timescale for a number of exoplanets with properties amenable to plasma torus construction. Assuming a uniform toroidal geometry comparable to Io's "warm" torus, we calculate quasi-steady torus masses inferable from the optical depth of atomic spectral features in torus-contaminated stellar spectra. The calculated quasi-steady masses can be used to constrain the volcanic outgassing rates of each species detected in the torus, providing quantitative estimates of bulk volcanic activity and interior composition with minimal assumptions. Such insight into the interior state of an exoplanet is otherwise accessible only after destruction via tidal forces. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method by showcasing known exoplanets which are susceptible to tidal heating and could generate readily-detectable tori with realistic outgassing rates of order 1 ton s$^{-1}$, comparable to the Io plasma torus mass injection rate. This methodology may be applied to stellar spectra measured with ultraviolet instruments with sufficient resolution to detect atomic lines and sensitivity to recover the ultraviolet continuum of GKM dwarf stars. This further motivates the need for ultraviolet instrumentation above Earth's atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Species Atmospheric Escape Model with Excited Hydrogen and Helium: Application to HD209458b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape shapes exoplanet evolution and star-planet interactions, with He I 10830 \AA\ absorption serving as a key tracer of mass loss in hot gas giants. However, transit depths vary significantly across observed systems for reasons that remain poorly understood. HD209458b, the archetypal hot-Jupiter, exhibits relatively weak He I 10830 \AA\ and H$\alpha$ absorption, which has been interpreted as evidence for a high H/He ratio (98/2), possibly due to diffusive separation. To investigate this possibility and other processes that control these transit depths, we reassess excitation and de-excitation rates for metastable helium and explore the impact of diffusion processes, stellar activity, and tidal forces on the upper atmosphere and transit depths using a model framework spanning the whole atmosphere. Our model reproduces the observed He I transit depth and H$\alpha$ upper limit, showing strong diffusive separation. We match the observations assuming a photoelectron efficiency of 20-40\%, depending on the composition of the atmosphere, corresponding to mass-loss rates of $1.9-3\times10^{10}$ g/s. We find that the He I 10830 \AA\ transit depth is sensitive to both stellar activity and diffusion processes, while H$\alpha$ is largely unaffected due to its strong dependence on Lyman-$\alpha$ excitation. These differences may help explain the system-to-system scatter seen in population-level studies of the He I line. While He I data alone may not tightly constrain mass-loss rates or temperatures, they do confirm atmospheric escape and help narrow the viable parameter space when interpreted with physically motivated models. Simultaneous observations of He I, H$\alpha$, and stellar activity indicators provide powerful constraints on upper atmosphere dynamics and composition, even in the absence of full transmission spectra.</description>

      <title>Impact chronology of leftover planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the formation of the Moon the terrestrial planets were pummelled by impacts from planetesimals left over from terrestrial planet formation. This work attempts to reproduce the impact rates set by modern crater chronologies using leftover planetesimals from three different dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation. I ran dynamical simulations for 1 billion years using leftover planetesimals from the Grand Tack, Depleted Disc and Implantation models of terrestrial planet formation with the GENGA N-body integrator. I fit the cumulative impacts on the Earth and Mars using a function that is a sum of exponentials with different weighing factors and e-folding times. Most fits require three or four terms. The fitted timescales cluster around t1=10 Myr, t2=35 Myr, t3=100 Myr and t4&gt;200 Myr. I attribute them to dynamical losses of planetesimals through different mechanisms: high-eccentricity Earth crossers and the nu6 secular resonance, Earth crossers, Mars crossers, and objects leaking on to Mars crossing orbits from beyond Mars. I place a constraint on the initial population using the known Archean terrestrial spherule beds, and I conclude that the Archean impacts were mostly created by leftover planetesimals. The inferred mass in leftover planetesimals at the time of the Moon's formation was about 0.015 Earth masses. The third time constant is comparable to that of modern crater chronologies. As such, the crater chronologies are indicative of impacts by an ancient population of Mars crossers. The initial perihelion distribution of the leftovers is a major factor in setting the rate of decline: to reproduce the current crater chronologies the number of Earth crossers at the time of the Moon's formation had to be at most half of the Mars crossers. These results together place constraints on dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Visual Binary TOI-6883AB and its dynamical implications for the planetary companion TOI-6883Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that TOI-6883 is a physically bound visual binary system composed of two solar-type stars, TOI-6883A (TIC 393818343) and TOI-6883B (TIC 393818340), initially regarded as a single star hosting the exoplanet TOI-6883b. Gaia DR3 astrometry shows that both stars have nearly identical parallaxes 10.6 mas, consistent proper motions, and a projected separation of 616 AU, confirming their binary nature. Using astrometric and photometric data, we estimate the stellar masses, physical separation, and an orbital period of 15,000 years. The system is energetically bound. We revise the planet designation to TOI-6883Ab to reflect stellar multiplicity. We evaluate the impact of the binary companion on planetary stability and find the planet's orbit to be long-term stable, although Kozai-Lidov perturbations remain possible. Further astrometric and photometric follow-up will be essential to better constrain the binary orbit and assess potential dynamical influences on the planetary architecture.</description>

      <title>AstroQ: Automated Scheduling of Cadenced Astronomical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomy relies heavily on time domain observations. To maximize the scientific yield of such observations, astronomers must carefully match the observational cadence to the phenomena of interest. This presents significant scheduling challenges for observatories with multiple large programs, each with different cadence needs. To address this challenge, we developed AstroQ, an automated framework for scheduling cadenced observations. We tested this on a suite of Doppler exoplanet programs at Keck Observatory, where the algorithm powers the KPF-Community Cadence project. As a point of reference, AstroQ can determine the provably optimal ordering of 3680 observations of 200 targets -- each with its own cadence needs and accessibility constraints -- over a six month period to five minute time resolution. Schedules of this size may be constructed in ~120 seconds on modern workstation, enabling dynamic rescheduling due to weather changes, target-of-opportunity interrupts, and other needs. A key advantage of AstroQ over manual scheduling is realistic projections of program completion, savings in human effort, and elimination of human bias in balancing many programs. AstroQ is open source and may be applied to other scheduling needs, both in astronomy and beyond.</description>

      <title>SPECULOOS: five years hunting terrestrial planets around ultra-cool dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) project aims to detect temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby ultracool dwarfs, including late M-dwarf stars and brown dwarfs, which are well-suited for atmospheric characterization using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and upcoming giant telescopes like the European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Led by the University of Li\`ege, SPECULOOS is conducted in partnership with the University of Cambridge, the University of Birmingham, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Bern, and ETH Zurich. The project operates a network of robotic telescopes at two main observatories: SPECULOOS-South in Chile, with four telescopes, and SPECULOOS-North in Tenerife, currently with one telescope (soon to be two). This network is complemented by the SAINT-EX telescope located in San Pedro M\'artir, Mexico. In this paper, we review the status of our facilities after five years of operations, the current challenges and development plans, and our latest scientific results.</description>

      <title>A New Spectral Class of Brown Dwarfs at the Bottom of the IMF in IC 348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an estimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon, which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\sim2$ $M_{\rm Jup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new members ($\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by the presence of the 3.4 $\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.</description>

      <title>From Colors to Spectra and Back Again: First Near-IR Spectroscopic Survey of Neptunian Trojans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present 0.7-5.0 {\mu}m spectra of eight Neptunian Trojans (NTs) as observed by the JWST's NIRSpec instrument. The reddest NT, 2013 VX30, exhibits a unique spectrum with strong absorption features between 3 - 4 {\mu}m, while the bluest NT, 2006 RJ103, shows negligible water absorption. A principal component analysis comparing these spectra with those of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and Centaurs reveals that most NTs belong to the "Bowl-type" spectral group, while 2013 VX30 is categorized as "Cliff-type" in the Pinilla-Alonso et al. (2025) taxonomy. For the bluest NT in our sample, 2006 RJ103 shows some evidence that it may be related to carbonaceous asteroids. For the red object 2011 SO277, we find no close TNO spectral counterpart. Except for the true outlier 2011 SO277, NTs have better spectral analogs among Plutinos and distant Centaurs, suggesting that spectral variation within major groups may arise from current temperature and location, rather than solely from formation regions. Finally, we highlight optical slope (S') and near-IR slope (SIR1) as effective indicators for distinguishing spectral groups and identifying outliers. These findings enable the use of broad-band photometry to explore NT and TNO surface compositions, especially for faint objects, which will be directly applicable to large photometric surveys like the Dark Energy Survey and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST.</description>

      <title>A transiting giant planet in orbit around a 0.2-solar-mass host star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet formation models suggest that the formation of giant planets is significantly harder around low-mass stars, due to the scaling of protoplanetary disc masses with stellar mass. The discovery of giant planets orbiting such low-mass stars thus imposes strong constraints on giant planet formation processes. Here, we report the discovery of a transiting giant planet orbiting a $0.207 \pm 0.011 M_{\odot}$ star. The planet, TOI-6894 b, has a mass and radius of $M_P = 0.168 \pm 0.022 M_J (53.4 \pm 7.1 M_{\oplus})$ and $R_P = 0.855 \pm 0.022 R_J$, and likely includes $12 \pm 2 M_{\oplus}$ of metals. The discovery of TOI-6894 b highlights the need for a better understanding of giant planet formation mechanisms and the protoplanetary disc environments in which they occur. The extremely deep transits (17% depth) make TOI-6894 b one of the most accessible exoplanetary giants for atmospheric characterisation observations, which will be key for fully interpreting the formation history of this remarkable system and for the study of atmospheric methane chemistry.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Electric Dipole Moment of AlCl by Stark Level Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the electric dipole moment of aluminum monochloride (AlCl) using a cryogenic buffer-gas beam source. Using Stark shift spectroscopy, we derive values for the dipole moments in the body-fixed frame of the two lowest vibrational states for the $X^1\Sigma^+$ electronic state, $\mu_X(v''=0) = -1.679$ D and $\mu_X(v'' = 1) = -1.761$ D, and for the $A^1\Pi$ state, $\mu_A(v' = 0) = -1.030$ D and $\mu_A(v' = 1) = -1.052$ D. We also show that the ab initio calculations of the dipole moment and $T_e$ energy of AlCl are sensitive to the level of treatment of the spin-orbit orbit coupling. We further lay out the implications of these results for astrophysical models of stellar and planetary evolution that have used a substitute value for the dipole moment of AlCl until now.</description>
