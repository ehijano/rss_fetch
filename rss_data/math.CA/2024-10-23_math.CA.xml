      <title>Twisted bilinear spherical maximal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain $L^p-$estimates for the full and lacunary maximal functions associated to the twisted bilinear spherical averages given by \[\mathfrak{A}_t(f_1,f_2)(x,y)=\int_{\mathbb S^{2d-1}}f_1(x+tz_1,y)f_2(x,y+tz_2)\;d\sigma(z_1,z_2),\;t&gt;0,\] for all dimensions $d\geq1$. We show that the estimates for such operators in dimensions $d\geq2$ essentially relies on the method of slicing. The bounds for the lacunary maximal function in dimension one is more delicate and requires a trilinear smoothing inequality which is based on an appropriate sublevel set estimate in this context.</description>

      <title>A partial converse to the Riemann--Lebesgue lemma for Bessel--Fourier series of order zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Bessel--Fourier coefficients $f_m$ of a function $f$ such that $\sqrt{x}f(x)$ is integrable over $[0,1]$ satisfy $f_m/\sqrt{m}\to 0$. We show a partial converse, namely that for $0\leq \alpha&lt;1/2$ and any non-negative $a_m\to 0$, there is a function $f$ such that $x^{\alpha+1}f(x)$ is integrable and its Bessel--Fourier coefficients $f_m$ satisfy $m^{-\alpha}f_m\geq a_m$ and $m^{-\alpha}f_m\to 0$. We conjecture that the same should be true when $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$, and discuss some consequences of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Finite bivariate biorthogonal $N$-Konhauser polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new set of finite 2D biorthogonal polynomials is defined using the finite orthogonal polynomials $N_{n}^{(p)}(w)$ and the Konhauser polynomials. We present a connection between this finite 2D biorthogonal set and the generalized Laguerre-Konhauser polynomials. Also, we introduce several applications of finite bivariate biorthogonal $N$-Konhauser polynomials.</description>

      <title>The identification of diffusions from imperfect observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification of an $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued diffusion $X$ when a running function of it, say $h(X_t)$, is observed. A point-wise observation of the process (in other words, observing $h(X_t)$ in isolation) cannot identify $X_t$ unless the $h$ is injective. However observing $h(X_s)$ on a small interval $[t,t+\varepsilon]$ can be enough to determine $X_t$ exactly. The paper contain results that expand on this idea; in particular, a property of `fine total asymmetry' of twice continuously differentiable $h$ is introduced that depends on the fine topology of potential theory and that is both necessary and sufficient for $X$ to be adapted to a natural right-continuous filtration generated by the observations. This particular filtration, though augmented with null sets, does not depend on the distribution of $X_0$. For real-analytic $h$ the property reduces to simple asymmetry; that is, there is no nontrivial affine isometry $\kappa$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $h = h \circ \kappa$. A second result concerns the case where $X_0$ is given and $h$ is merely Borel; then $X$ is adapted to an augmented filtration generated by the observation process $(h(X_t))_{t\geq 0}$ if $h$ is `locally invertible' on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$ dense in the fine topology on $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval in Fock space and perturbation of Liouville sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00385v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the determination of functions in Fock space from samples of their absolute value, known as the phase retrieval problem in Fock space. An important finding in this research field asserts that phaseless sampling on lattices of arbitrary density renders the problem unsolvable. The present study establishes solvability when using irregular sampling sets of the form $A \cup B \cup C$, where $A, B,$ and $C$ constitute perturbations of a Liouville set, i.e., a set with the property that all functions in Fock space bounded on the set are constant. The sets $A, B,$ and $C$ adhere to specific geometrical conditions of closeness and noncollinearity. We show that these conditions are sufficiently generic so as to allow the perturbations to be chosen also at random. By proving that Liouville sets occupy an intermediate position between sets of stable sampling and sets of uniqueness, we obtain the first construction of uniqueness sets for the phase retrieval problem in Fock space having a finite density. The established results apply to the Gabor phase retrieval problem in subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, where we derive additional reductions of the size of uniqueness sets: for the class of real-valued functions, uniqueness is achieved from two perturbed lattices; for the class of even real-valued functions, a single perturbation suffices, resulting in a separated set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine scaling properties of sets satisfying various weak forms of invariance. For general attractors of possibly overlapping bi-Lipschitz iterated function systems, we establish that the Assouad dimension is given by the Hausdorff dimension of a tangent at some point in the attractor. Under the additional assumption of self-conformality, we moreover prove that this property holds for a subset of full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>On a degenerate second order traffic model: existence of discrete evolutions, deterministic many-particle limit and first order approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a new microscopic second order Follow-the-Leader type scheme to describe traffic flows. The main novelty of this model consists in multiplying the second order term by a nonlinear function of the global density, with the intent of considering the attentiveness of the drivers in dependence of the amount of congestion. Such term makes the system highly degenerate; indeed, coherently with the modellistic viewpoint, we allow for the nonlinearity to vanish as soon as consecutive vehicles are very close to each other. We first show existence of solutions to the degenerate discrete system. We then perform a rigorous discrete-to-continuum limit, as the number of vehicles grows larger and larger, by making use of suitable piece-wise constant approximations of the relevant macroscopic variables. The resulting continuum system turns out to be described by a degenerate pressure-less Euler-type equation, and we discuss how this could be considered an alternative to the groundbreaking Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model. Finally, we study the singular limit to first order dynamics in the spirit of a vanishing-inertia argument. This eventually validates the use of first order macroscopic models with nonlinear mobility to describe a congested traffic stream.</description>

      <title>Restriction of Fractional Derivatives of the Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we showed that for suitable $(\beta,p, s,\ell)$ the $\beta$-order fractional derivative with respect to the last coordinate of the Fourier transform of an $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function is in $H^{-s}$ after restricting to a graph of a function with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature provided that the restriction of the Fourier transform of such function to the surface is in $H^{\ell}$. This is a generalization of the result in \cite{GoldStol}*{Theorem 1.12}.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation results for neural networks with non-polynomial activation function over non-compact domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks beyond the classical formulation over compact domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we derive universal approximation results for neural networks within function spaces over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, e.g., weighted spaces, $L^p$-spaces, and (weighted) Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains, where the latter includes the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Furthermore, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.</description>
