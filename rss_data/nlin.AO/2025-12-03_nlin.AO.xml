      <title>Convergence to stationary points in the Weisbuch-Kirman-Herreiner model for buyers' preferences in fish markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a paper published in The Economic Journal in 2000, Weisbuch et al.\ introduce a model for buyers' preferences to the various sellers in over-the-counter (OTC) fish markets. While this model has become an archetype of economic conceptualization that combines bounded rationality and myopic reasoning, the literature on its asymptotic behaviours has remained scarce. In this paper, we proceed to a mathematical analysis of the dynamics and its full characterization in the simplest case of homogeneous buyer populations. By using elements of the theory of cooperative dynamical systems, we prove that, independently of the number of sellers and parameters, for almost every initial condition, the subsequent trajectory must asymptotically approach a stationary state. Moreover, for simple enough distributions of the sellers' attractiveness, we determine all stationary states and their parameter-dependent stability. This analysis shows that in most cases, the asymptotic preferences are ordered as the attractiveness are. However, depending on the parameters, there also exist robust functioning modes in which those sellers with highest preference are not the ones that provide highest profit.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in Dirac electron tunneling transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.</description>

      <title>Stability of Synchronized Motion in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2297</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.2297v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a succinct and self-contained description of the synchronized motion on networks of mutually coupled oscillators. Usually, the stability criterion for the stability of synchronized motion is obtained in terms of Lyapunov exponents. We consider the fully diffusive case which is amenable to treatment in terms of uniform contractions. This approach provides a rigorous, yet clear and concise, way to the important results.</description>
