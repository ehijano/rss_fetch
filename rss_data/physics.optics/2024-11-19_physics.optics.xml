      <title>Solitons in composite linear-nonlinear moir\'{e} lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce families of two-dimensional gap solitons (GSs) maintained by moir\'{e} lattices (MLs) composed of linear and nonlinear sublattices, with the defocusing sign of the nonlinearity. Depending on the angle between the sublattices, the ML may be quasiperiodic or periodic, composed of mutually incommensurate or commensurate sublattices, respectively (in the latter case, the inter-lattice angle corresponds to Pythagorean triples). The GSs include fundamental, quadrupole, and octupole solitons, as well as quadrupoles and octupoles carrying unitary vorticity. Stability segments of the GS families are identified by means of the linearized equation for small perturbations, and confirmed by direct simulations of perturbed evolution.</description>

      <title>Towards 250-m gigabits-per-second underwater wireless optical communication using a low-complexity ANN equalizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakthroughs of communication distance and data rate have been eagerly anticipated by scientists in the area of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC), which is seriously limited by the obvious aquatic attenuation in underwater channel. High-power laser source and ultra-sensitive photodetector are straightforward to extend the UWOC distance. However, nonlinear impairments caused by bandwidth-limited high-power transmitter and sensitive receiver severely degrade the data rate of long-distance UWOC. In this paper, we develop a UWOC system using a high-power transmitter by beam combining of 8-channel cascaded laser diodes (LD) and a sensitive receiver by a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM). The combined linear equalizer and low-complexity Artificial Neural Network (ANN) equalizer are used to achieve 1-Gbps data transmission over a 250-m UWOC system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Gbps-level UWOC experimental demonstration in &gt;250-meter underwater transmission that has ever been reported. To lower the complexity of the ANN equalizer, a linear equalizer is applied first in order to prune the input size of the ANN equalizer. The optimal input size of the ANN equalizer is identified as 9. And the ANN architecture consists of two hidden layers, with 10 neurons in the first layer and a single neuron in the second layer. The performance of the proposed ANN-based system is compared with that of systems employing Volterra and linear equalizers. The bit error rate (BER) at data rate of 1 Gbps over a 250-m UWOC is reduced to with the combined linear and ANN equalizer, which is below the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) limit. In contrast, the linear and Volterra equalizer-based systems achieve data rates of 500 Mbps and 750 Mbps, respectively.</description>

      <title>High-gain optical parametric amplification with continuous-wave pump using domain-engineered thin film lithium niobate waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While thin film lithium niobate (TFLN) is known for efficient signal generation, on-chip signal amplification remains challenging from fully integrated optical communication circuits. Here we demonstrate the first continuous-wave-pump optical parametric amplification (OPA) using an x-cut domain-engineered TFLN waveguide, with high gain over the telecom band up to 13.9 dB, and test it for high signal-to-noise ratio signal amplification using a commercial optical communication module pair. Fabricated in wafer scale using common process as devices including modulators, this OPA device marks an important step in TFLN photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Optimal structured light waves generation in 3D volumes using communication mode optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of light intensity in 3D volumes is highly in demand in many applications in optics. Various wavefront shaping techniques have been utilized to reconstruct a target amplitude profile within a 3D space. However, these techniques are intrinsically limited by cross-talk and often rely on optimization methods to improve the reconstruction quality. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new wavefront shaping method based on interfering the optimum orthogonal communication modes connecting a source plane and a receiving volume. These optimum modes are computed from the singular value decomposition of a coupling operator that connects each point at the source plane to another one in the receiving volume. The modes comprise a pair of source and receiving eigenfunctions, each one forming a complete orthogonal basis for their respective spaces. We utilize these modes to construct arbitrarily chosen 2D and 3D structured light waves within the output receiving volume and optically generate these waves using a spatial light modulator. Our generated intensity profiles exhibit low cross-talk, high fidelity, and high contrast. We envision our work to inspire new directions in any domain that requires controlling light intensity in 3D with high precision such as in holography, microscopy, metrology, light-matter interactions, and optical sensing.</description>

      <title>First Integrals of Homogeneous Vector Fields and the Eigenmirror Problem of Geometric Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenmirror problem asks: ``When does the reflection of a surface in a curved mirror appear undistorted to an observer?'' We call such a surface an {\em eigensurface} and the corresponding mirror an {\em eigenmirror}. The data for an eigenmirror problem consists of a homogeneous transformation ${\bf H}:\mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ that encodes what it means for two observers to see a surface in the ``same way.''
  A solution to this problem is a differentiable 2-manifold that (1) satisfies a first-order partial differential equation called the {\bf anti-eikonal equation}, and (2) satisfies certain side inequalities that ensure that a ray reflecting off the mirror behaves in a physically meaningful way. Although these side inequalities initially seem like an ad hoc global restriction, we show that under reasonable conditions, an integral curve of the characteristic flow of the anti-eikonal equation may not intersect the boundary of an eigenmirror. Thus, in those cases, the eigenmirror is invariant under the characteristic flow. We give several examples exhibiting our results.</description>

      <title>Picocavity-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of physisorbed H2 and D2 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at a cryogenic temperature (10 K). The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at sub-nanometer gap distances of the junction formed by a Ag tip and Ag(111) surface. We clarify that the predominant contribution of the electromagnetic field enhancement of the picocavity to the detection of a single hydrogen molecule. The gap-distance dependent TERS reveals not only the evolution of the picocavity field, but also the interaction between the molecule and tip/surface, which exhibit nontrivial isotope effects. A significant red-shift and peak broadening of the H-H stretching as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretching mode is unaffected. A combination of density functional theory and reduced-dimension models reveals that a distinct anharmonicity in the mode potential of H2 is one cause of the anomalous red-shift, whereas D2 has less anharmonicity due to the geometric isotope effect.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers operating in the 1550 nm telecom band with wavelength-scale mode volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-integrated, multi-wavelength nanoscale lasers with ultra-low power consumption and ultra-compact footprints are essential for energy-efficient, fast and high-throughput data processing. Currently, on-chip multi-wavelength lasers predominantly rely on arrays of discrete large-scale conventional semiconductor lasers that are susceptible to the fabrication imperfections. Topological rainbow nanolasers, which spatially confine and emit specific topologically protected light frequencies, offer a prospective approach for achieving ultra-compact integrated multi-wavelength light sources with enhanced robustness against perturbations and defects. However, it remains a significant challenge to achieve highly localized topological rainbow trapping in nanocavities for laser emission with both high quality factors and ultra-small mode volumes. Here, we experimentally report ultra-compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers operating in the 1550 nm telecom band. Specifically, we present rainbow-like emission with uniform wavelength spacing and wavelength-scale mode volume $\sim 0.7 \left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^3$ in a one-dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust lasing operation across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of approximately 70 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate an ultra-compact two-dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser in an exceptionally compact footprint of nearly 0.002 $\text{mm}^2$, featuring a broad rainbow spectra with 64 continuously tuned lasing peaks. Our work provides a promising method for realizing robust and nanoscale multi-wavelength tunable laser sources, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra-compact photonic chips.</description>

      <title>Scalable fabrication of erbium-doped high-Q silica microtoroid resonators via sol-gel coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores sol-gel methods for fabricating erbium-doped silica microtoroid resonators, addressing the limitations of conventional doping techniques and enhancing device scalability. We develop a reproducible sol-gel process that yields defect-free films for photonic applications, and detail common defects and troubleshooting strategies. Two fabrication methods are compared: traditional film deposition on substrates and the direct coating of prefabricated resonators. The latter enables the fabrication of larger resonator diameters (up to 450 {\mu}m) without buckling, while achieving a high-Q factor and a low lasing threshold of 350 {\mu}W. These erbium-doped resonators exhibit multi-mode laser oscillations at 1550 nm, revealing the sol-gel method's potential for realizing scalable, gain-doped photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Second Harmonic Generation and Nonlinear Frequency Conversion in Photonic Time-Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear process of second harmonic generation in photonic time-crystals, materials with refractive index that varies abruptly and periodically in time, and obtain the phase matching condition for this process. We find conditions for which the second harmonic generation is highly enhanced even in the absence of phase matching, governed by the exponential growth of the modes residing in the momentum gap of the photonic time crystal. Additionally, under these conditions, a cascade of higher order harmonics is generated at growing exponential rates. The process is robust, with no requirement for phase-matching, the presence of a resonance or a threshold, drawing energy from the modulation.</description>

      <title>Optical Tweezers with AC Dielectric Levitation: A Powerful Approach to Microparticle Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers, with their high precision, dynamic control, and non-invasiveness, are increasingly important in scientific research and applications at the micro and nano scales. However, manipulation by optical tweezers is challenged by adsorption forces, including van der Waals forces, capillary forces, and electrostatic forces, which are present between micro- and nano-objects. Due to the inherent limitations of optical forces imposed by laser power, these adsorption forces are difficult to overcome. Inspired by maglev trains, we propose a multiphysics coupling method that combines dielectrophoretic and optical gradient forces to achieve broad applicability and low-damage micro-nanoscale particle manipulation. We developed a device that introduces electric fields to detach objects from hard substrates using alternating current (AC) dielectric levitation before manipulation with optical tweezers. We utilized micron-sized polystyrene (PS) microspheres as objects and elucidated the levitation mechanism through finite element simulation. For larger particles, such as a 100 {\mu}m PS microparticle and a 200 {\mu}m micro-gear, AC dielectric levitation enabled manipulation by optical tweezers. Also, the better viability of three kinds of cells displayed the low bio-damage of the proposed method. Given its broad applicability and biocompatibility, AC dielectric levitation technology significantly expands the capabilities of optical tweezers, allowing for the manipulation of larger particles and cells. This advancement addresses the limitations of optical tweezers in handling large-scale particles and enhances their versatility in various applications.</description>

      <title>4H-SiC microring opto-mechanical oscillator with a self-injection locked pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge, self-injection locking of a distributed feedback (DFB) diode laser to a multimode 4H-silicon carbide (4H-SiC) microring resonator, and observed resonant opto-mechanical oscillation in the cavity modes. While the fundamental transverse-electric mode family of the silicon carbide microring was optically pumped, Stokes light was generated in the adjacent fundamental transverse-magnetic resonant mode. The threshold of the process did not exceed 5~mW of light entering the cavity characterized with a loaded optical quality factor of $\smash{2\times10^6}$. These results mark a significant milestone in unlocking the potential of 4H-SiC through turnkey soliton microcomb generation and empowering future advancements in areas such as cavity optomechanics using this versatile and quantum-friendly material platform.</description>

      <title>Multi-topological phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of topological phases of matter and topological boundary states had tremendous impact on condensed matter physics and photonics, where topological phases are defined via energy bands, giving rise to topological band theory. However, topological systems that cannot be described by band topology but still support non-trivial boundary states are little-known and largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a new kind of topological phase of matter named "multi-topological phase" (MTP) that features multiple sets of boundary states, where each set is associated with one distinct topological invariant. Unlike conventional topological phase transitions, the MTP transitions can occur without band-gap closing. We present typical examples of MTPs in a one-dimensional topological insulator and a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator, where the systems are otherwise trivial according to band topology. Furthermore, MTPs can exist also in indirectly gapped Chern insulators, beyond the regime where the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary states. Experimentally, we demonstrate the first two examples of MTPs in laser-written photonic lattices. Our findings constitute a fundamental advance in topological physics and provide a route for designing novel topological materials.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable coherent pulse generation in semiconductor lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a laser, the control of its spectral emission depends on the physical dimensions of the optical resonator, limiting it to a set of discrete cavity modes at specific frequencies. Here, we overcome this fundamental limit by demonstrating a monolithic semiconductor laser with a continuously tunable repetition rate from 4 up to 16 GHz, by employing a microwave driving signal that induces a spatiotemporal gain modulation along the entire laser cavity, generating intracavity mode-locked pulses with a continuously tunable group velocity. At the output, frequency combs with continuously tunable mode spacings are generated in the frequency domain, and coherent pulse trains with continuously tunable repetition rates are generated in the time domain. Our results pave the way for fully tunable chip-scale lasers and frequency combs, advantageous for use in a diverse variety of fields, from fundamental studies to applications such as high-resolution and dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Experimental probe of band structures of bilayer valley photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on two-dimensional van der Waals materials has demonstrated that the layer degree of freedom can significantly alter the physical properties of materials due to the substantial modification of bulk bands. Inspired by this concept, layered photonic systems have been proposed and realized, revealing novel phenomena absent in their monolayer counterparts. In this work, we experimentally investigate the band structures of bilayer valley photonic crystals. Two typical structures with different stacking configurations are experimentally imaged via the near-field scanning technology, exhibiting distinct bulk band structures. Furthermore, different topological edge modes induced by distinct topology are observed, revealing that the layer degree of freedom can be regarded as a pseudospin and offer further capabilities for controlling the flow of light. Our work not only elucidates the evolution of band structures from monolayer to bilayer topological systems but also provides an experimental platform for the further exploration of bilayer topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: The use of machine learning to predict wave dynamics is a topic of growing interest, but commonly-used deep learning approaches suffer from a lack of interpretability of the trained models. Here we present an interpretable machine learning framework for analyzing the nonlinear evolution dynamics of optical wavepackets in complex wave media. We use sparse regression to reduce microscopic discrete lattice models to simpler effective continuum models which can accurately describe the dynamics of the wavepacket envelope. We apply our approach to valley-Hall domain walls in honeycomb photonic lattices of laser-written waveguides with Kerr-type nonlinearity and different boundary shapes. The reconstructed equations accurately reproduce the linear dispersion and nonlinear effects including self-steepening and self-focusing. This scheme is proven free of the a priori limitations imposed by the underlying hierarchy of scales traditionally employed in asymptotic analytical methods. It represents a powerful interpretable machine learning technique of interest for advancing design capabilities in photonics and framing the complex interaction-driven dynamics in various topological materials.</description>

      <title>Strong nanophotonic quantum squeezing exceeding 3.5 dB in a foundry-compatible Kerr microresonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light, with its quantum noise reduction capabilities, has emerged as a powerful resource in quantum information processing and precision metrology. To reach noise reduction levels such that a quantum advantage is achieved, off-chip squeezers are typically used. The development of on-chip squeezed light sources, particularly in nanophotonic platforms, has been challenging. We report 3.7 $\pm$ 0.2 dB of directly detected nanophotonic quantum squeezing using foundry-fabricated silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microrings with an inferred squeezing level of 10.7 dB on-chip. The squeezing level is robust across multiple devices and pump detunings, and is consistent with the overcoupling degree without noticeable degradation from excess classical noise. We also offer insights to mitigate thermally-induced excess noise, that typically degrades squeezing, by using small-radius rings with a larger free spectral range (450 GHz) and consequently lower parametric oscillation thresholds. Our results demonstrate that Si$_3$N$_4$ is a viable platform for strong quantum noise reduction in a CMOS-compatible, scalable architecture.</description>

      <title>Coherence effects in LIPSS formation on silicon wafers upon picosecond laser pulse irradiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using different laser irradiation patterns to modify of silicon surface, it has been demonstrated that, at rather small overlapping between irradiation spots, highly regular laser-induced periodic surface structures (LIPSS) can be produced already starting from the second laser pulse, provided that polarization direction coincides with the scanning direction. If the laser irradiation spot is shifted from the previous one perpendicular to light polarization, LIPSS are not formed even after many pulses. This coherence effect is explained by a three-wave interference, - surface electromagnetic waves (SEWs) generated within the irradiated spot, SEWs scattered from the crater edge formed by the previous laser pulse, and the incoming laser pulse, - providing conditions for amplification of the periodic light-absorption pattern. To study possible consequences of SEW scattering from the laser-modified regions, where the refractive index can change due to material melting, amorphization, and the residual stress formed by previous laser pulses, hydrodynamic modelling and simulations have been performed within the melting regime. The simulations show that stress and vertical displacement could be amplified upon laser scanning. Both mechanisms, three-wave interference and stress accumulation, could enable an additional degree of controlling surface structuring.</description>

      <title>Consensus Statement on Brillouin Light Scattering Microscopy of Biological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) spectroscopy is a non-invasive, non-contact, label-free optical technique that can provide information on the mechanical properties of a material on the sub-micron scale. Over the last decade it has seen increased applications in the life sciences, driven by the observed significance of mechanical properties in biological processes, the realization of more sensitive BLS spectrometers and its extension to an imaging modality. As with other spectroscopic techniques, BLS measurements not only detect signals characteristic of the investigated sample, but also of the experimental apparatus, and can be significantly affected by measurement conditions. The aim of this consensus statement is to improve the comparability of BLS studies by providing reporting recommendations for the measured parameters and detailing common artifacts. Given that most BLS studies of biological matter are still at proof-of-concept stages and use different--often self-built--spectrometers, a consensus statement is particularly timely to assure unified advancement.</description>

      <title>Coherent imperfect absorption of counter-propagating beams through an absorptive slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) has been a topic of considerable contemporary research interest. However, its implementation in practical applications has been limited, since it has been demonstrated only for plane waves till now. The issue for beams with finite confinement -- characterized by a collection of plane waves -- is that complete destructive interference is not feasible for all the plane waves simultaneously. In this paper, we study the absorption characteristics of two counter-propagating structured beams, e.g., Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams with and without orbital angular momentum respectively, incident normally on a composite slab from both sides by fulfilling the CPA condition exclusively for the central plane waves. We show that though perfect absorption is not achievable, there can be a substantial reduction of the scattered light. We also consider CPA for oblique incidence and discuss the difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-shaped electron energy-loss spectroscopy (PSEELS) measures the scattering probability of structured free electron beams by a target. Over the last decade, it was shown that this scheme can be employed to emulate polarized optical spectroscopies with electrons, and therefore to transpose macroscopic optical concepts - such as dichroism - down to the deep sub-wavelength scale. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that PSEELS can, in fact, go way further than mimicking optics and enables to map a plethora of so far inaccessible nano-optical quantities such as the electric quadrupolar momentum.</description>

      <title>High-energy, few-cycle light pulses tunable across the vacuum ultraviolet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades the development of ultrafast lasers has revolutionized our ability to gain insight into light-matter interactions. The appearance of few-cycle light sources available from the visible to the mid-infrared spectral range and the development of attosecond extreme ultraviolet and x-ray technologies provide for the first time the possibility to directly observe and control ultrafast electron dynamics in matter on their natural time scale. However, few-fs sources have hardly been available in the deep ultraviolet (DUV; 4-6 eV, 300-200 nm) and are unavailable in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV; 6-12 eV, 200-100 nm) spectral range, corresponding to the photon energies required for valence excitation of atoms and molecules. Here, we generate VUV pulses with $\mu$J energy tunable between 160 and 190 nm via resonant dispersive wave emission during soliton self-compression in a capillary. We fully characterize the pulses in situ using frequency-resolved optical gating based on two-photon photoionization in noble gases. The measurements reveal that in most of the cases the pulses are shorter than 3 fs. These findings unlock the potential to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics with a time-resolution that has been hitherto inaccessible when using VUV pulses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photodynamics of diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers limits their performance in many quantum technologies. Quenching of photoluminescence, which degrades NV readout, is commonly ascribed to a dark state that is not fully understood. Using a nanoscale cavity to generate intense infrared fields that quench NV emission nonlinearly with field intensity, we show that the dark state is accessed by two-photon pumping into the $^4A_2$ quartet state of the neutrally charged NV (NV$^0$). We constrain this state's energy relative to the NV$^0$ ground-state ($^2E$) to $&gt;0.58$\,eV and the recombination energy threshold to the NV$^-$ ground state ($^3A_2$) to $&lt;2.01$ eV. Furthermore, we show that accessing this state allows sensing of local infrared fields. This new understanding will allow predictions of the limits of NV technologies reliant upon intense fields, including levitated systems, spin--optomechanical devices, and absorption--based magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature amplified transduction of infrared to visible photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency transduction, which converts photons from one energy level to another, provides a way to bridge different quantum devices. The frequency transduction has been studied across various systems and frequency ranges, depending on the applications. In particular, infrared photons are ideal for long-distance communication, but their detection efficiency is often low. Converting infrared photons to visible light, where affordable detectors with high quantum efficiency are widely available, would offer significant advantages. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of transduction of 1500-nm photons to 553-nm photons at room temperature using barium atoms of a three-level $\Lambda$ system. In our experiment conducted in free space, we could amplify the visible photons, achieving an internal efficiency of 1.49, exceeding unity. We also observed that the minimum transduction bandwidth is determined by the total decay rate of the excited state in the $\Lambda$-type energy levels. Moreover, we propose ways to improve the internal efficiency by 200-fold and to implement polarization-sensitive transduction in our scheme to be applicable in quantum information. The present work is a step forward for the integration of quantum devices at different energy levels as well as for the development of efficient infrared-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics vary depending on the type of squeezing applied. Additionally, we examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valleytronics is an emerging technology exploiting the anisotropy of electron populations in multiple energy degenerate conduction band minima (valleys) in semiconductors for information storage and processing. To compete with conventional electronics, universal and fast methods for controlling and reading the valley quantum number of electrons have to be developed. Addressing the inequivalent conduction band valleys based on optical selection rules has been demonstrated in two-dimensional crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry. However, selective optical manipulation with electron populations in inequivalent valleys has not been possible in many technologically important semiconductor materials that possess multiple conduction band minima, including silicon and diamond. Here we demonstrate an ultrafast technique allowing to generate and read valley polarized population of electrons in bulk semiconductors on sub-picosecond time scales. The principle is based on unidirectional intervalley scattering of electrons accelerated by oscillating electric field of linearly polarized infrared femtosecond pulses. The degree of valley polarization is measured via polarization anisotropy of Drude absorption of a delayed infrared probe pulse allowing us to directly characterize intervalley scattering times in silicon and diamond at different temperatures. Our results pave the way towards room temperature valleytronic devices working at terahertz frequencies that will be compatible with contemporary silicon-based technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) is becoming an indispensable and powerful tool in the emerging field of attochemistry, while the interpretation of measurements often requires full considerations of the coupling among various freedoms of motion. Here we develop the ionization-coupling model to incorporate the transient absorption and explore the coupled electronic-vibrational dynamics of nitrogen ions induced by strong-field ionization (SFI), which has been investigated in the recent transient x-ray K-edge absorption experiment [PRL 129, 123002 (2022)]. It is found the coherent vibrational wave packet on the involved electronic state is created with broad distribution of vibrational levels which leads to the spectral overlap on the K-edge absorption. By identifying the contributions of each electronic state, the study provides a different interpretation revealing the significant role of the excited state $A^2\Pi_u$ arising from the electronic-vibrational coupling in strong laser fields. We uncover new features of absorption from forbidden transitions during the laser pulse and confirm the vibronic coherence induced modulations of absorbance after SFI. A new scheme is proposed to avoid the spectral overlap and determine the population among the states which is crucial to resolve the debate on nitrogen air lasing. The work lays down the framework to research the ionic coherence in ATAS and offers valuable insights into the intricate interplay between electronic and vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation. The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts. Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping, momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale, which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reports the successful fabrication of high-positive refractive index change waveguides, exceeding 0.02 in fluoride glasses, marking a significant advancement in integrated optical components for visible to mid-infrared applications. This research overcomes longstanding challenges in direct-write photonics and therefore enables the realization of true 3D geometries in optical elements, access to novel visible lasing wavelengths typically suppressed in high phonon hosts, and the miniaturization of mid-infrared optical devices. The investigation into the waveguides' origin attributes the exceptionally high index change to material densification driven by the migration of specific elements, mainly barium, within the glass composition. These waveguides, characterized by low insertion losses, and highly customizable V-numbers evidenced by multimode operation at 3.5 um, offers substantial potential for chip laser technology and the creation of advanced optical devices for sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expressions for Effective Indices of Modes of Optical Fibers Near and Beyond Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the effective indices of modes of circular step-index fibers valid near their cutoff wavelengths. The approximation, being a first-order Taylor series of a smooth function, is also valid for the real part of the effective index beyond cutoff where the modes become lossy. The approximation is used to derive certain previously unknown mode properties. For example, it is shown that for non-dispersive materials the EH-mode group index at cutoff, surprisingly, does not depend on wavelength, core radius, or even radial mode order.</description>

      <title>PZT Optical Memristors</title>

Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of new applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation efficiency. For the first time, we unprecedentedly reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss, high precision, high-efficiency modulation, high stability quasi-continuity and reconfigurability. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical switching. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Tellegen Response in Media with Multiple Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tellegen response is a special type of nonreciprocal magneto-electric coupling which long remained elusive in photonics and extremely weak in condensed matter. It is widely accepted that the Tellegen coefficient is restricted by $\chi^2&lt;\varepsilon\mu$, where $\varepsilon$ and $\mu$ are permittivity and permeability of the material. Here, we demonstrate that this restriction is lifted in the medium with several close resonances, which provides a theoretical foundation for giant Tellegen response.</description>

      <title>Decoherence control of a single-photon optomechanical system in phase-sensitive reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05554v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in strong single-photon optomechanical coupling also demand a deeper understanding of environmental interactions in this regime. The inadequacy of the standard Lindblad master equation necessitates the use of the Dressed-State Master Equation (DSME), which accounts for the correct eigenstates. This work investigates the impact of squeezed vacuum and thermal reservoirs on the decoherence of cavity photon Fock states in the strong coupling regime. We demonstrate that decoherence can be effectively controlled by tuning reservoir parameters, with the control mediated through a cavity dephasing term that becomes significant at high temperatures. The findings presented provide critical insights into reservoir engineering for precise control of quantum decoherence, advancing the understanding of strongly coupled optomechanical systems in engineered environments.</description>

      <title>Radiative-Conductive Heat Transfer Dynamics in Dissipative Dispersive Anisotropic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent theoretical formalism to model the dynamics of heat transfer in dissipative, dispersive, anisotropic nanoscale media, such as metamaterials. We employ our envelope dyadic Green's function method to solve Maxwell's macroscopic equations for the propagation of fluctuating electromagnetic fields in these media. We assume that the photonic radiative heat transfer mechanism in these media is complemented by dynamic phononic mechanisms of heat storage and conduction, accounting for effects of local heat generation. By employing the Poynting theorem and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the radiative heat flux and the coupling term of photonic and phononic subsystems, which contains the heating rate and the radiative heat power contributions. We apply our formalism to the paraxial heat transfer in uniaxial media and present relevant closed-form expressions. By considering a Gaussian transverse temperature profile, we also obtain and solve a system of integro-differential heat diffusion equations to model the paraxial heat transfer in uniaxial reciprocal media. By applying the developed analytical model to radiative-conductive heat tranfer in nanolayered media constructed by layers of silica and germanium, we compute the temperature profiles for the three first orders of expansion and the total temperature profile as well. The results of this research can be of interest in areas of science and technology related to thermophotovoltaics, energy harvesting, radiative cooling, and thermal management at micro- and nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical estimator for training encapsulated deep photonic neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) are fast in-propagation and high bandwidth paradigms that aim to popularize reproducible NN acceleration with higher efficiency and lower cost. However, the training of PNN is known to be a challenge, where the device-to-device and system-to-system variations create imperfect knowledge of the PNN. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training algorithms often being the industry standard for their robustness, generality, and fast gradient convergence for digital training, existing PNN-BP methods rely heavily on the accurate intermediate state extraction for a deep PNN (DPNN). These information accesses truncate the photonic signal propagation, bottlenecking DPNN's operation speed and increasing the system construction cost. Here, we introduce the asymmetrical training (AT) method, tailored for encapsulated DPNNs, where the signal is preserved in the analogue photonic domain for the entire structure. AT's minimum information readout for training bypasses analogue-digital interfaces wherever possible for fast operation and minimum system footprint. AT's error tolerance and generality aim to promote PNN acceleration in a widened operational scenario despite the fabrication variations and imperfect controls. We demonstrated AT for encapsulated DPNN with integrated photonic chips, repeatably enhancing the performance from in-silico BP for different network structures and datasets.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and singular behaviors with Bohmian trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is able to predict challenging behaviors even in the simplest physical scenarios. These behaviors are possible because of the important dynamical role that phase plays in the evolution of quantum systems, and are very similar, on the other hand, to effects observable in analogous optical systems. This work focuses on how Bohmian mechanics proves to be a rather convenient theoretical framework to analyze phase-based phenomena, since the phase constitutes the central element in this hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics. More specifically, it allows us to understand how spatial phase variations give rise to velocity fields that eventually rule the dynamical behavior of quantum systems, and that, when integrated in time locally (i.e., taking into account specific positions), they provide us with a neat local (point by point) description of the system evolution in the configuration space. Indeed, it will also be seen that this idea transcends the quantum realm and can be profitably used to describe the behavior of optical analogs with rather singular behaviors. With this purpose, two interesting phenomena that take place in free space are considered, namely, the self-acceleration and shape-invariance of Airy beams, and spontaneous self-focusing.</description>

      <title>Super-bunching light with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-classical light sources emitting bundles of N-photons with strong correlation represent versatile resources of interdisciplinary importance with applications ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to quantum information processing. Yet, high-order correlations, gN(0),quantifying photon correlation, are still limited to hundreds. Here, we report the generation of a super-bunching light source in photonic crystal fiber with g2(0) reaching 5.86*104 and g5(0) up to 2.72*108, through measuring its photon number probability distributions. under giant g2(0) values, the super-bunching light source presents upturned-tail photon distributions and ubiquitous extreme multi-photon events, where 31 photons from a single light pulse at a mean of 1.99*10-4 photons per pulse have been determined. The probability of this extreme event has been enhanced by 10139 folds compared to a coherent laser with Poissonian distribution. By varying the power of the pumping laser, both photon number distributions and corresponding high-order correlations of this light source can be substantially tailored from Poissonian to super-bunching distributions. These phenomena are attributed to the synchronized nonlinear interactions in photonic crystal fibers pumping by bright squeezed light, and the theoretical simulations agree well with the experimental results. Our research showcases the ability to achieve non-classical light sources with giant high-order correlations and extreme multi-photon events, paving the way for high-order correlation imaging, extreme nonlinear optical effects, quantum information processing, and exploring light-matter interactions with multi-photon physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A field theory for the distribution of transmission eigenvalues through a disordered medium is developed in details. The central equation of this theory is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance. This equation determines the transmission eigenvalue distribution not only in the diffusive regime but also in the quasiballistic regime, where the radiance is expected to be significantly anisotropic in the material bulk. We show that the matrix transport equation can be solved analytically in this regime. We also show that, in addition to the finite-width waveguide, our equation is able to predict the transmission eigenvalue distribution through an infinite slab.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Field Theory of Wave Transmission Statistics in Disordered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a field theory to characterize the mean distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through a disordered medium. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which assumes uniform field intensity across scattering channels. As a result, it accurately predicts the transmission eigenvalue distribution both in the diffusive and quasiballistic regime. In addition, it proves to be more versatile than the DMPK theory, allowing for the incorporation of physical effects such as absorption or partial channel control with minimal adjustments to the formalism. Although these effects are commonly encountered in experiments on complex media, until now there has been no ab initio theory addressing them. Our predictions are numerically validated against transmission eigenvalue distributions computed from the microscopic wave equation.</description>
