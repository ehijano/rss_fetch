      <title>Learnable Community-Aware Transformer for Brain Connectome Analysis with Token Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscientific research has revealed that the complex brain network can be organized into distinct functional communities, each characterized by a cohesive group of regions of interest (ROIs) with strong interconnections. These communities play a crucial role in comprehending the functional organization of the brain and its implications for neurological conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and biological differences, such as in gender. Traditional models have been constrained by the necessity of predefined community clusters, limiting their flexibility and adaptability in deciphering the brain's functional organization. Furthermore, these models were restricted by a fixed number of communities, hindering their ability to accurately represent the brain's dynamic nature. In this study, we present a token clustering brain transformer-based model ($\texttt{TC-BrainTF}$) for joint community clustering and classification. Our approach proposes a novel token clustering (TC) module based on the transformer architecture, which utilizes learnable prompt tokens with orthogonal loss where each ROI embedding is projected onto the prompt embedding space, effectively clustering ROIs into communities and reducing the dimensions of the node representation via merging with communities. Our results demonstrate that our learnable community-aware model $\texttt{TC-BrainTF}$ offers improved accuracy in identifying ASD and classifying genders through rigorous testing on ABIDE and HCP datasets. Additionally, the qualitative analysis on $\texttt{TC-BrainTF}$ has demonstrated the effectiveness of the designed TC module and its relevance to neuroscience interpretations.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Framework for the Problem of Security for Cognition in Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in neurotechnology in recent years has created an emerging critical intersection between neurotechnology and security. Implantable devices, non-invasive monitoring, and non-invasive therapies all carry with them the prospect of violating the privacy and autonomy of individuals' cognition. A growing number of scientists and physicians have made calls to address this issue -- which we term Cognitive Security -- but applied efforts have been limited. A major barrier hampering scientific and engineering efforts to address Cognitive Security is the lack of a clear means of describing and analyzing relevant problems. In this paper we develop Cognitive Security, a mathematical framework which enables such description and analysis by drawing on methods and results from multiple fields. We demonstrate certain statistical properties which have significant implications for Cognitive Security, and then present descriptions of the algorithmic problems faced by attackers attempting to violate privacy and autonomy, and defenders attempting to obstruct such attempts.</description>

      <title>SlicerTMS: Real-Time Visualization of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Mental Health Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time visualization system for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique for treating various brain disorders and mental health diseases. Our solution targets the current challenges of slow and labor-intensive practices in treatment planning. Integrating Deep Learning (DL), our system rapidly predicts electric field (E-field) distributions in 0.2 seconds for precise and effective brain stimulation. The core advancement lies in our tool's real-time neuronavigation visualization capabilities, which support clinicians in making more informed decisions quickly and effectively. We assess our system's performance through three studies: First, a real-world use case scenario in a clinical setting, providing concrete feedback on applicability and usability in a practical environment. Second, a comparative analysis with another TMS tool focusing on computational efficiency across various hardware platforms. Lastly, we conducted an expert user study to measure usability and influence in optimizing TMS treatment planning. The system is openly available for community use and further development on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/lorifranke/SlicerTMS}.</description>

      <title>Visual Decoding and Reconstruction via EEG Embeddings with Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to decode human vision through neural signals has attracted a long-standing interest in neuroscience and machine learning. Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of fMRI-based visual decoding and reconstruction. However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for EEG-based visual reconstruction. In this study, we present an EEG-based visual reconstruction framework. It consists of a plug-and-play EEG encoder called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which is aligned with image embeddings, and a two-stage EEG guidance image generator that first transforms EEG features into image priors and then reconstructs the visual stimuli with a pre-trained image generator. Our approach allows EEG embeddings to achieve superior performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. Our two-stage image generation strategy vividly reconstructs images seen by humans. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of signals from different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. We report that EEG-based visual decoding achieves SOTA performance, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications. The code of ATM is available at https://github.com/dongyangli-del/EEG_Image_decode.</description>
