      <title>Does light slowdown in dielectric media?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations and theoretical principles indicate that electromagnetic waves, including light, propagate in dielectric media at speeds lower than those in free space, as eloquently expressed in Maxwell's equations featuring material-dependent permittivity and permeability. This study reveals that the observed slower propagation of waves in dielectric media arises from an interference between two types of waves: a forward-moving primary wave and a set of secondary waves induced by the primary wave's interaction with the medium. The forward-moving primary wave and secondary waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum. Notably, the reflected wave caused by the impedance discontinuity on the boundary of a dielectric medium is manifested by the induced secondary waves moving in the opposite direction to the primary wave. From a photonic point of view, photons will be moving back and forth below the slowly moving apparent front of the observed wave with the speed of light in vacuum. Ahead of this front the probability of finding photons is zero due to complete destructive interference of the waves in that region. From a photonic perspective, beneath the gradually advancing facade of the observed wave, photons move at the unyielding speed of light in vacuum. The likelihood of detecting photons ahead of the front diminishes to zero, a consequence of the thorough destructive interference manifesting within that specific region.</description>

      <title>Viscous rebound of a quasi-2D cylinder on a solid wall</title>

Abstract: The purpose of the present study is to extend the simple concept of apparent coefficient of restitution, widely approached in the literature for the case of a single-contact-point between a sphere and a wall, to the case of bouncing whose complexity is increased due to the shape of the contacting object.
  Experiments are carried out with a finite-length cylinder, freely falling in a liquid at rest. Complex 3D motions of the cylinder with respect to the wall occur during bouncing, including multi-contact-points between the cylinder and the bottom as well as cavitation.
  We investigate numerical modelling of an idealized situation (2D infinite cylinder falling parallel to the wall) with 2D simulations where the fluid equations of motion were coupled to the particle equation of motion through an Immersed Boundary Method. The particle equation of motion is coupled to an elastic force to model bouncing, requiring a parameterization of the cut-off length (interpreted as a roughness) and the contact time (associated with the contact elasticity) used here to capture the experimental observations. The simulations confirmed that i) the departure of the coefficient of restitution from 0 is strictly dependent on the apparent roughness and ii) the coefficient of restitution depends on the contact time.
  Finally, we model the coefficient of restitution as the product of two contributions to the mechanical loss of energy: the collision-to-terminal velocity ratio ($V_c/V_t$) of the approach-phase and the rebound-to-collision velocity ratio ($-V_r/V_c$) of the contact-phase. This leads to a reasonably good prediction of the coefficient of restitution in the intermediate regime in $St$. This suggests the relevance of lumping the complex details of physical phenomena involved during contact into a simple concept based on the contact apparent roughness and elasticity.</description>

      <title>Turbulence induced by a swarm of rising bubbles from coarse-grained simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of a homogeneous swarm of bubbles rising at large Reynolds number, Re = 760 with volume fractions ranging from 1% to 10%. We consider a simplified model in which the interfaces are not resolved, but which allows us to simulate flows with a large number of bubbles and to emphasize the interactions between bubble wakes. The liquid phase is described by solving, on an Eulerian grid, the Navier-Stokes equations, including sources of momentum which model the effect of the bubbles. The dynamics of each bubble is determined within the Lagrangian framework by solving an equation of motion involving the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the fluid accounting for the correction of the fictitious self-interaction of a bubble with its own wake. The comparison with experiments shows that this coarse-grained simulations approach can reliably describe the dynamics of the resolved flow scales. We use conditional averaging to characterize the mean bubble wakes and obtain in particular the typical shear imposed by the rising bubbles. On the basis of the spectral decomposition of the energy budget, we observe that the flow is dominated by production at large scales and by dissipation at small scales and we rule out the presence of an intermediate range in which the production and dissipation are locally in balance. We propose that the k-3 subrange of the energy spectra results from the mean shear rate imposed by the bubbles, which controls the rate of return to isotropy.</description>
