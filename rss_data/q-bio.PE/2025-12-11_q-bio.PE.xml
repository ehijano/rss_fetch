      <title>Inhomogeneous Branching Random Walks: Incorporating Genealogy and Density Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework using inhomogeneous Branching Random Walks (BRWs) to model growth processes, specifically introducing genealogy-dependence in branching rates and displacement distributions to model phenomena like bacterial colony growth. Current stochastic models often either assume independent and identical behavior of individual agents or incorporate only spatiotemporal inhomogeneity, ignoring the effect of genealogy-based inhomogeneity on the long-time behavior of these processes. Such long-time asymptotics are of independent mathematical interest and are crucial in understanding the effect of patterns. We propose several inhomogeneous BRW models in 2D space where displacement distributions and branching rates vary with time, space, and genealogy. A combined model then uses a weighted average of positions given by these separate models to study the shape of the growth patterns. Using computer simulations, we tune parameters from these models, which are based on genealogical and spatiotemporal factors, observe the resulting structures, and compare them with images of real bacterial colonies.</description>

      <title>Self-organized hyperuniformity in a minimal model of population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By generalizing a class of models recently introduced to account for protracted transients in biological systems, we identify a novel mechanism for hyperuniformity. In this model, competition of particles over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. We show that, in its spatially extended form, this many-particle model exhibits hyperuniform density fluctuations. Through explicit coarse-graining, we develop a hydrodynamic theory that conforms closely with the results of stochastic simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, hyperuniformity arises from the divergence of the interaction range as the system approaches the critical point. These findings may find applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics, and ecology.</description>

      <title>How Conflict Aversion Can Enable Authoritarianism: An Evolutionary Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Such conflicts are often asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger normative constraints on acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game. This framework yields two outcomes -- cyclic authoritarian resurgence through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist--authoritarian coalition excluding resistance -- depending on confrontation responses. We demonstrate how an established dynamical framework with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions clarifies conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.</description>
