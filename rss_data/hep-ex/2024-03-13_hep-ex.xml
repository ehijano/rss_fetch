      <title>Search for cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter-electron scatterings in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first search for the elastic scatterings between cosmic-ray boosted sub-MeV dark matter and electrons in the PandaX-4T liquid xenon experiment. Sub-MeV dark matter particles can be accelerated by scattering with electrons in the cosmic rays and produce detectable electron recoil signals in the detector. Using the commissioning data from PandaX-4T of 0.63~tonne$\cdot$year exposure, we set new constraints on DM-electron scattering cross sections for DM masses ranging from 10~eV/$c^2$ to 3~keV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Search for low-mass resonances decaying into two jets and produced in association with a photon or a jet at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is performed for localized excesses in the low-mass dijet invariant mass distribution, targeting a hypothetical new particle decaying into two jets and produced in association with either a high transverse momentum photon or a jet. The search uses the full Run 2 data sample from LHC proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during 2015-2018. Two variants of the search are presented for each type of initial-state radiation: one that makes no jet flavor requirements and one that requires both of the jets to have been identified as containing $b$-hadrons. No excess is observed relative to the Standard Model prediction, and the data are used to set upper limits on the production cross-section for a benchmark $Z'$ model and, separately, for generic, beyond the Standard Model scenarios which might produce a Gaussian-shaped contribution to dijet invariant mass distributions. The results extend the current constraints on dijet resonances to the mass range between 200 and 650 GeV.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the charge ratio and polarization of cosmic-ray muons with the Super-Kamiokande detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the charge ratio ($R$) and polarization ($P^{\mu}_{0}$) measurements using the decay electron events collected from 2008 September to 2022 June by the Super-Kamiokande detector. Because of its underground location and long operation, we performed high precision measurements by accumulating cosmic-ray muons. We measured the muon charge ratio to be $R=1.32 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at $E_{\mu}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}=0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ $\mathrm{TeV}$, where $E_{\mu}$ is the muon energy and $\theta_{\mathrm{Zenith}}$ is the zenith angle of incoming cosmic-ray muons. This result is consistent with the Honda flux model while this suggests a tension with the $\pi K$ model of $1.9\sigma$. We also measured the muon polarization at the production location to be $P^{\mu}_{0}=0.52 \pm 0.02$ $(\mathrm{stat.}{+}\mathrm{syst.})$ at the muon momentum of $0.9^{+0.6}_{-0.1}$ $\mathrm{TeV}/c$ at the surface of the mountain; this also suggests a tension with the Honda flux model of $1.5\sigma$. This is the most precise measurement ever to experimentally determine the cosmic-ray muon polarization near $1~\mathrm{TeV}/c$. These measurement results are useful to improve the atmospheric neutrino simulations.</description>

      <title>Hard-scattering approach to strongly hindered electric dipole transitions between heavy quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional wisdom in dealing with electromagnetic transition between heavy quarkonia is the multipole expansion, when the emitted photon has a typical energy of order quarkonium binding energy. Nevertheless, in the case when the energy carried by the photon is of order typical heavy quark momentum, the multipole expansion doctrine is expected to break down. In this work, we apply the "hard-scattering" approach originally developed to tackle the strongly hindered magnetic dipole ($M1$) transition [Y.~Jia {\it et al.}, Phys. \ Rev. \ D. 82, 014008 (2010)] to the strongly hindered electric dipole ($E1$) transition between heavy quarkonia. We derive the factorization formula for the strongly hindered $E1$ transition rates at the lowest order in velocity and $\alpha_s$ in the context of the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), and conduct a detailed numerical comparison with the standard predictions for various bottomonia and charmonia $E1$ transition processes.</description>

      <title>Design and Integration of JUNO-OSIRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is a neutrino detection experiment characterized by an acrylic sphere, measuring 35.4 m in diameter, containing 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator. This sphere is encompassed by as many as 17,600 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with a 20-inch diameter, achieving an overall coverage of 77.9%. With these impressive capabilities, the JUNO experiment aims to achieve an exceptional effective energy resolution of 3% at 1 MeV. The Online Scintillator Internal Radioactivity Investigation System (OSIRIS) serves as a precursor detector, around 100 m aside in horizontal of the site of the JUNO detector underground, tasked with monitoring and examining the purity of the liquid scintillator prior to its transfer to the JUNO central detector. The OSIRIS, also as a pre-detector of JUNO, is constructed with a cylindrical acrylic vessel designed to hold 18 tons of liquid scintillator. It is situated within a 9-m height cylindrical tank filled with 550 tons of pure water. This detector was specifically engineered to search for the fast coincidence decays of $^{214}$Bi -$^{214}$Po and $^{212}$Bi -$^{212}$Po in the decay chains of $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, respectively.OSIRIS has been designed to reach a sensitivity of 10$^{-16}$ g/g for U/Th to test scintillator radiopurity to the level required for the detection of solar neutrinos. Additionally, 64 20-inch microchannel plate PMTs (MCP PMTs) were positioned around the liquid scintillator vessel to observe incoming interactions, along with an additional 12 20-inch MCP PMTs for the water Cherenkov muon veto system. The OSIRIS pre-detector has been fully constructed and integrated, providing a plenty of preliminary results from the air runs. The next step in the process involves commencing the filling soon, aiming to involve an in-depth examination of the impurities within the liquid scintillator.</description>

      <title>Final state radiation from high and ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged leptons produced by high-energy and ultrahigh-energy neutrinos have a substantial probability of emitting prompt internal bremsstrahlung $\nu_\ell + N \rightarrow \ell + X + \gamma$. This can have important consequences for neutrino detection. We discuss observable consequences at high- and ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes and LHC's Forward Physics Facility. Logarithmic enhancements can be substantial (e.g.\ $\sim 20\%$) when either the charged lepton's energy, or the rest of the cascade, is measured. We comment on applications involving the inelasticity distribution including measurements of the $\nu/\bar{\nu}$ flux ratio, throughgoing muons, and double-bang signatures for high-energy neutrino observation. Furthermore, for ultrahigh-energy neutrino observation, we find that final state radiation affects flavor measurements and decreases the energy of both Earth-emergent tau leptons and regenerated tau neutrinos. Finally, for LHC's Forward Physics Facility, we find that final state radiation will impact future extractions of strange quark parton distribution functions. Final state radiation should be included in future analyses at neutrino telescopes and the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charge and magnetisation distributions: flavour separation and zeroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving truncation of the quantum field equations describing hadron properties is used to deliver parameter-free predictions for all nucleon elastic electromagnetic form factors and their flavour separation to large values of momentum transfer, $Q^2$. The proton electric form factor, $G_E^p$, possesses a zero, whereas that of the neutron, $G_E^n$, does not. The difference owes to the behaviour of the Pauli form factor of the proton's singly-represented valence $d$-quark. Consequently, $G_E^n&gt;G_E^p$ on a material large-$Q^2$ domain. These predictions can be tested in modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Suppression of diffraction in deep-inelastic scattering on nuclei and dynamical mechanism of leading twist nuclear shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the leading twist approach (LTA) to nuclear shadowing, we calculate the ratios of diffractive and usual parton distributions for a heavy nucleus (Pb) and the proton, $R_{A/p}=(f_{i/A}^{D(3)}/f_{i/A})/(f_{i/p}^{D(3)}/f_{i/p})$, for coherent and summed (coherent plus quasi-elastic) nuclear deep-inelastic scattering. We find that $R_{A/p} \approx 0.5-1$ for quarks and $R_{A/p} \approx 0.5-1.3$ for gluons in a broad range of $x$, which reaffirms the difference from the nuclear enhancement of $R_{A/p}$ predicted in the gluon saturation framework. We demonstrate that the magnitude of $R_{A/p}$ is controlled by the cross section of the interaction of hadronic fluctuations of the virtual photon with target nucleons, which explains an enhancement of $R_{A/p}$ in the color dipole model and its suppression in LTA. We argue that the black disk limit of LTA corresponds to $R_{A/p}=1$ and $R^{\rm coh}_{A/p}=0.86$ for the summed and coherent scattering, respectively. Relying on an intuitive definition of the saturation scale, we show that the ratio of the saturation scales of a heavy nucleus and proton $Q_{sA}^2(b)/Q_{sp}^2(b) \approx 1$ at small impact parameters $b$ due to the strong leading twist nuclear shadowing and diluteness of the nuclear density.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the hunt for new phenomena in dijet final-states using anomaly detection filters at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of dijet searches in high-energy physics, a significant challenge has emerged: with experiments producing more and more data, the traditional methods of using analytic functions to describe dijet mass spectra start to fail. To address this, we suggest the application of an anomaly detection approach to eliminate less interesting background events based on event final states. This method not only bypasses the limitations of conventional background models but also significantly enhances our ability to detect potential signals of new physics. Through simulations that mimic the conditions of the upcoming High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, we demonstrate the strength and efficiency of this approach in dealing with large data volumes. The integration of unsupervised machine learning into our experimental framework paves the way for a promising avenue to unveil hidden physics discoveries within the overwhelming influx of data.</description>

      <title>Searches for the light invisible axion-like particle in $K^{+}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{0}a$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high statistics data sample of the $K^{+}$ decays is recorded by the OKA collaboration. A missing mass analysis is performed to search for a light invisible pseudoscalar axion-like particle (ALP) $a$ in the decay $K^{+} \to \pi^{+} \pi^{0} a$. No signal is observed, the upper limits for the branching ratio of the decay are calculated. The $90\%$ confidence level upper limit is changing from $2.5\cdot10^{-6}$ to $2\cdot10^{-7}$ for the ALP mass from 0 to 200 MeV/$c^{2}$, except for the region of $\pi^{0}$ mass, where the upper limit is $4.4\cdot10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Non-prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. The production of a heavy-quark pair is well-described by perturbative QCD, whereas the formation of the bound state involves non-perturbative processes, treated in different ways by various available theoretical models. ALICE can measure inclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ at both forward and midrapidity down to low ${p_{\rm T}}$ and the prompt and non-prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ separation can be performed at midrapidity. The study of the production of non-prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ originating from the decay of beauty hadrons, besides allowing to isolate the prompt $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross section from the inclusive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ cross section, can be used to estimate open beauty-hadron production. Heavy-flavour particle production in pp collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity can provide insight into the processes occuring in the collision at the partonic level, as well as the interplay between the hard and soft mechanisms in particle production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the pioneering contributions of Thomas K. Gaisser to the birth and development of particle astrophysics, a new field of research at the intersection of cosmic ray physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and particle physics that has emerged in the last few decades. We will especially focus on his studies of natural beams of neutrinos: those generated by the interactions of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere and those emitted by astrophysical sources. Tom actively participated in the discovery of these cosmic neutrinos as well. His contributions also extend to gamma-ray astronomy, the study of the cosmic ray spectra and composition, and the modeling of cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere and in astrophysical environments. Tom invariably focused his research on the theoretical and phenomenological problems of greatest interest at the time, producing frameworks that transparently interpreted often complex data. These studies have been very influential and have shaped the development of the field.</description>

      <title>Target mass corrections in lepton--nucleus DIS: theory and applications to nuclear PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the wide range of kinematics covered by current and planned deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) facilities, we revisit the formalism, practical implementation, and numerical impact of target mass corrections (TMCs) for DIS on unpolarized nuclear targets. An important aspect is that we only use nuclear and later partonic degrees of freedom, carefully avoiding a picture of the nucleus in terms of nucleons. After establishing that formulae used for individual nucleon targets $(p,n)$, derived in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) formalism, are indeed applicable to nuclear targets, we rewrite expressions for nuclear TMCs in terms of \mbox{re-scaled} (or averaged) kinematic variables. As a consequence, we find a representation for nuclear TMCs that is approximately independent of the nuclear target. We go on to construct a single-parameter fit for all nuclear targets that is in good numerical agreement with full computations of TMCs. We discuss in detail qualitative and quantitative differences between nuclear TMCs built in the OPE and the parton model formalisms, as well as give numerical predictions for current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Probing Zee-Babu states at Muon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zee-Babu model is a minimal realization of radiative neutrino mass generation mechanism at the two-loop level. We study the phenomenology of this model at future multi-TeV muon colliders. After imposing all theoretical and low-energy experimental constraints on the model parameters, we find that the Zee-Babu states are expected not to reside below the TeV scale, making it challenging to probe them at the LHC. We first analyze the production rates for various channels, including multi singly-charged and/or doubly-charged scalars at muon colliders. For concreteness, we study several benchmark points that satisfy neutrino oscillation data and other constraints and find that most channels have large production rates. We then analyze the discovery reach of the model using two specific channels: the pair production of singly- and doubly-charged scalars. For the phenomenologically viable scenarios considered in this study, charged scalars with masses up to ${\cal O}(3$--$4)$ TeV can be probed for the center-of-mass energy of $10$ TeV and total luminosity of $10~{\rm ab}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty components in profile likelihood fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a measurement of a physical quantity is reported, the total uncertainty is usually decomposed into statistical and systematic uncertainties. This decomposition is not only useful to understand the contributions to the total uncertainty, but also required to propagate these contributions in subsequent analyses, such as combinations or interpretation fits including results from other measurements or experiments. In profile-likelihood fits, widely applied in high-energy physics analyses, contributions of systematic uncertainties are routinely quantified using ``impacts'', which are not adequate for such applications. We discuss the difference between impacts and actual uncertainty components, and establish methods to determine the latter in a wide range of statistical models.</description>

      <title>Alternative scenarios for the LHC based electron-proton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Construction of the ERLC (twin LC) collider tangential to LHC will give opportunity to investigate ep collisions at essentially higher center-of-mass energies than ERL50 and LHC based ep collider. Luminosity estimations show that values well exceeding 10^{34} cm^{-2}s^{-1} can be achieved for ERLC and HL-LHC based ep colliders. Certainly, proposed ep colliders have great potential for clarifying QCD basics and new physics search in addition to providing precise PDFs for adequate interpretation of LHC experimental data. Another alternative to the ERL50 is to construct an e-ring with the same energy and length. In this case, 4.2x10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1} luminosity can be reached. The advantage of this option is that the {\mu}-ring can be installed instead of the e-ring as a next stage, which will allow it to reach a much higher center of mass energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of ions for light dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detection scheme is explored for light dark matter, such as axion dark matter or dark photon dark matter, using a Paul ion trap system. We first demonstrate that a qubit, constructed from the ground and first excited states of vibrational modes of ions in a Paul trap, can serve as an effective sensor for weak electric fields due to its resonant excitation. As a consequence, a Paul ion trap allows us to search for weak electric fields induced by light dark matter with masses around the neV range. Furthermore, we illustrate that an entangled qubit system involving $N$ ions can enhance the excitation rate by a factor of $N^2$. The sensitivities of the Paul ion trap system to axion-photon coupling and gauge kinetic mixing can reach previously unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Production of true para-muonium in linearly polarized photon fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: True muonium (TM) -- the bound state of $\mu^+\mu^-$ -- has not been discovered yet. It was demonstrated that searching for TM via $\gamma\gamma$ fusions in heavy ion collisions is feasible due to the enhancement of the atom number. We study the production of the true para-muonium (pTM) in the collisions of linearly polarized photons in the experiments of heavy-ion collisions, calculate the production rate as well as the transverse spectrum of pTM, and explore the discovery potential in nuclear experiments. Our results show that there is a significant correlation between the linearly polarized photon distribution and the transverse momentum distribution of pTM. The optimal kinematic region of the generated pTM is identified, which can provide a theoretical guide to the detection of pTM in experiments.</description>
