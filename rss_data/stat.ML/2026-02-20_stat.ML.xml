      <title>Beyond Procedure: Substantive Fairness in Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free uncertainty quantification for machine learning models, yet its interplay with fairness in downstream decision-making remains underexplored. Moving beyond CP as a standalone operation (procedural fairness), we analyze the holistic decision-making pipeline to evaluate substantive fairness-the equity of downstream outcomes. Theoretically, we derive an upper bound that decomposes prediction-set size disparity into interpretable components, clarifying how label-clustered CP helps control method-driven contributions to unfairness. To facilitate scalable empirical analysis, we introduce an LLM-in-the-loop evaluator that approximates human assessment of substantive fairness across diverse modalities. Our experiments reveal that label-clustered CP variants consistently deliver superior substantive fairness. Finally, we empirically show that equalized set sizes, rather than coverage, strongly correlate with improved substantive fairness, enabling practitioners to design more fair CP systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/llm-in-the-loop-conformal-fairness.</description>

      <title>Poisson-MNL Bandit: Nearly Optimal Dynamic Joint Assortment and Pricing with Decision-Dependent Customer Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamic joint assortment and pricing where a seller updates decisions at regular accounting/operating intervals to maximize the cumulative per-period revenue over a horizon $T$. In many settings, assortment and prices affect not only what an arriving customer buys but also how many customers arrive within the period, whereas classical multinomial logit (MNL) models assume arrivals as fixed, potentially leading to suboptimal decisions. We propose a Poisson-MNL model that couples a contextual MNL choice model with a Poisson arrival model whose rate depends on the offered assortment and prices. Building on this model, we develop an efficient algorithm PMNL based on the idea of upper confidence bound (UCB). We establish its (near) optimality by proving a non-asymptotic regret bound of order $\sqrt{T\log{T}}$ and a matching lower bound (up to $\log T$). Simulation studies underscore the importance of accounting for the dependency of arrival rates on assortment and pricing: PMNL effectively learns customer choice and arrival models and provides joint assortment-pricing decisions that outperform others that assume fixed arrival rates.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) work remarkably well in semi-supervised node regression, yet a rigorous theory explaining when and why they succeed remains lacking. To address this gap, we study an aggregate-and-readout model that encompasses several common message passing architectures: node features are first propagated over the graph then mapped to responses via a nonlinear function. For least-squares estimation over GNNs with linear graph convolutions and a deep ReLU readout, we prove a sharp non-asymptotic risk bound that separates approximation, stochastic, and optimization errors. The bound makes explicit how performance scales with the fraction of labeled nodes and graph-induced dependence. Approximation guarantees are further derived for graph-smoothing followed by smooth nonlinear readouts, yielding convergence rates that recover classical nonparametric behavior under full supervision while characterizing performance when labels are scarce. Numerical experiments validate our theory, providing a systematic framework for understanding GNN performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>Anti-causal domain generalization: Leveraging unlabeled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of domain generalization concerns learning predictive models that are robust to distribution shifts when deployed in new, previously unseen environments. Existing methods typically require labeled data from multiple training environments, limiting their applicability when labeled data are scarce. In this work, we study domain generalization in an anti-causal setting, where the outcome causes the observed covariates. Under this structure, environment perturbations that affect the covariates do not propagate to the outcome, which motivates regularizing the model's sensitivity to these perturbations. Crucially, estimating these perturbation directions does not require labels, enabling us to leverage unlabeled data from multiple environments. We propose two methods that penalize the model's sensitivity to variations in the mean and covariance of the covariates across environments, respectively, and prove that these methods have worst-case optimality guarantees under certain classes of environments. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach on a controlled physical system and a physiological signal dataset.</description>

      <title>MGD: Moment Guided Diffusion for Maximum Entropy Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating samples from limited information is a fundamental problem across scientific domains. Classical maximum entropy methods provide principled uncertainty quantification from moment constraints but require sampling via MCMC or Langevin dynamics, which typically exhibit exponential slowdown in high dimensions. In contrast, generative models based on diffusion and flow matching efficiently transport noise to data but offer limited theoretical guarantees and can overfit when data is scarce. We introduce Moment Guided Diffusion (MGD), which combines elements of both approaches. Building on the stochastic interpolant framework, MGD samples maximum entropy distributions by solving a stochastic differential equation that guides moments toward prescribed values in finite time, thereby avoiding slow mixing in equilibrium-based methods. We formally obtain, in the large-volatility limit, convergence of MGD to the maximum entropy distribution and derive a tractable estimator of the resulting entropy computed directly from the dynamics. Applications to financial time series, turbulent flows, and cosmological fields using wavelet scattering moments yield estimates of negentropy for high-dimensional multiscale processes.</description>

      <title>genriesz: A Python Package for Automatic Debiased Machine Learning with Generalized Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient estimation of causal and structural parameters can be automated using the Riesz representation theorem and debiased machine learning (DML). We present genriesz, an open-source Python package that implements automatic DML and generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating Riesz representers by minimizing empirical Bregman divergences. This framework includes covariate balancing, nearest-neighbor matching, calibrated estimation, and density ratio estimation as special cases. A key design principle of the package is automatic regressor balancing (ARB): given a Bregman generator $g$ and a representer model class, genriesz} automatically constructs a compatible link function so that the generalized Riesz regression estimator satisfies balancing (moment-matching) optimality conditions in a user-chosen basis. The package provides a modulr interface for specifying (i) the target linear functional via a black-box evaluation oracle, (ii) the representer model via basis functions (polynomial, RKHS approximations, random forest leaf encodings, neural embeddings, and a nearest-neighbor catchment basis), and (iii) the Bregman generator, with optional user-supplied derivatives. It returns regression adjustment (RA), Riesz weighting (RW), augmented Riesz weighting (ARW), and TMLE-style estimators with cross-fitting, confidence intervals, and $p$-values. We highlight representative workflows for estimation problems such as the average treatment effect (ATE), ATE on treated (ATT), and average marginal effect estimation. The Python package is available at https://github.com/MasaKat0/genriesz and on PyPI.</description>

      <title>SOLVAR: Fast covariance-based heterogeneity analysis with pose refinement for cryo-EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful technique for resolving the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules. A key challenge in cryo-EM is characterizing continuous heterogeneity, where molecules adopt a continuum of conformational states. Covariance-based methods offer a principled approach to modeling structural variability. However, estimating the covariance matrix efficiently remains a challenging computational task. In this paper, we present SOLVAR (Stochastic Optimization for Low-rank Variability Analysis), which leverages a low-rank assumption on the covariance matrix to provide a tractable estimator for its principal components, despite the apparently prohibitive large size of the covariance matrix. Under this low-rank assumption, our estimator can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be solved quickly and accurately. Moreover, our framework enables refinement of the poses of the input particle images, a capability absent from most heterogeneity-analysis methods, and all covariance-based methods. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate that the algorithm accurately captures dominant components of variability while maintaining computational efficiency. SOLVAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets in a recent heterogeneity benchmark. The code of the algorithm is freely available at https://github.com/RoeyYadgar/SOLVAR.</description>

      <title>On the Mechanism and Dynamics of Modular Addition: Fourier Features, Lottery Ticket, and Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of how two-layer neural networks learn features to solve the modular addition task. Our work provides a full mechanistic interpretation of the learned model and a theoretical explanation of its training dynamics. While prior work has identified that individual neurons learn single-frequency Fourier features and phase alignment, it does not fully explain how these features combine into a global solution. We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the "winner" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma. Finally, we use these insights to demystify grokking, characterizing it as a three-stage process involving memorization followed by two generalization phases, driven by the competition between loss minimization and weight decay.</description>

      <title>Distillation and Interpretability of Ensemble Forecasts of ENSO Phase using Entropic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distillation framework for an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models, trained exclusively on satellite-era observational and reanalysis data to predict ENSO phase up to 24 months in advance. While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of "distilled" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.
  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model "superclusters", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.</description>

      <title>ML-driven detection and reduction of ballast information in multi-modal datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern datasets often contain ballast as redundant or low-utility information that increases dimensionality, storage requirements, and computational cost without contributing meaningful analytical value. This study introduces a generalized, multimodal framework for ballast detection and reduction across structured, semi-structured, unstructured, and sparse data types. Using diverse datasets, entropy, mutual information, Lasso, SHAP, PCA, topic modelling, and embedding analysis are applied to identify and eliminate ballast features. A novel Ballast Score is proposed to integrate these signals into a unified, cross-modal pruning strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that significant portions of the feature space as often exceeding 70% in sparse or semi-structured data, can be pruned with minimal or even improved classification performance, along with substantial reductions in training time and memory footprint. The framework reveals distinct ballast typologies (e.g. statistical, semantic, infrastructural), and offers practical guidance for leaner, more efficient machine learning pipelines.</description>

      <title>A statistical perspective on transformers for small longitudinal cohort data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of longitudinal cohort data typically involves complex temporal dependencies between multiple variables. There, the transformer architecture, which has been highly successful in language and vision applications, allows us to account for the fact that the most recently observed time points in an individual's history may not always be the most important for the immediate future. This is achieved by assigning attention weights to observations of an individual based on a transformation of their values. One reason why these ideas have not yet been fully leveraged for longitudinal cohort data is that typically, large datasets are required. Therefore, we present a simplified transformer architecture that retains the core attention mechanism while reducing the number of parameters to be estimated, to be more suitable for small datasets with few time points. Guided by a statistical perspective on transformers, we use an autoregressive model as a starting point and incorporate attention as a kernel-based operation with temporal decay, where aggregation of multiple transformer heads, i.e. different candidate weighting schemes, is expressed as accumulating evidence on different types of underlying characteristics of individuals. This also enables a permutation-based statistical testing procedure for identifying contextual patterns. In a simulation study, the approach is shown to recover contextual dependencies even with a small number of individuals and time points. In an application to data from a resilience study, we identify temporal patterns in the dynamics of stress and mental health. This indicates that properly adapted transformers can not only achieve competitive predictive performance, but also uncover complex context dependencies in small data settings.</description>

      <title>M-estimation under Two-Phase Multiwave Sampling with Applications to Prediction-Powered Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-phase multiwave sampling, inexpensive measurements are collected on a large sample and expensive, more informative measurements are adaptively obtained on subsets of units across multiple waves. Adaptively collecting the expensive measurements can increase efficiency but complicates statistical inference. We give valid estimators and confidence intervals for M-estimation under adaptive two-phase multiwave sampling. We focus on the case where proxies for the expensive variables -- such as predictions from pretrained machine learning models -- are available for all units and propose a Multiwave Predict-Then-Debias estimator that combines proxy information with the expensive, higher-quality measurements to improve efficiency while removing bias. We establish asymptotic linearity and normality and propose asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also develop an approximately greedy sampling strategy that improves efficiency relative to uniform sampling. Data-based simulation studies support the theoretical results and demonstrate efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>When More Experts Hurt: Underfitting in Multi-Expert Learning to Defer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning to Defer (L2D) enables a classifier to abstain from predictions and defer to an expert, and has recently been extended to multi-expert settings. In this work, we show that multi-expert L2D is fundamentally more challenging than the single-expert case. With multiple experts, the classifier's underfitting becomes inherent, which seriously degrades prediction performance, whereas in the single-expert setting it arises only under specific conditions. We theoretically reveal that this stems from an intrinsic expert identifiability issue: learning which expert to trust from a diverse pool, a problem absent in the single-expert case and renders existing underfitting remedies failed. To tackle this issue, we propose PiCCE (Pick the Confident and Correct Expert), a surrogate-based method that adaptively identifies a reliable expert based on empirical evidence. PiCCE effectively reduces multi-expert L2D to a single-expert-like learning problem, thereby resolving multi expert underfitting. We further prove its statistical consistency and ability to recover class probabilities and expert accuracies. Extensive experiments across diverse settings, including real-world expert scenarios, validate our theoretical results and demonstrate improved performance.</description>

      <title>Gaussian surrogates do well on Poisson inverse problems</title>

Abstract: In imaging inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements, it is common to use objectives derived from the Poisson likelihood. But performance is often evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), which raises a practical question: how much does a Poisson objective matter for MSE, even at low dose? We analyze the MSE of Poisson and Gaussian surrogate reconstruction objectives under Poisson noise. In a stylized diagonal model, we show that the unregularized Poisson maximum-likelihood estimator can incur large MSE at low dose, while Poisson MAP mitigates this instability through regularization. We then study two Gaussian surrogate objectives: a heteroscedastic quadratic objective motivated by the normal approximation of Poisson data, and a homoscedastic quadratic objective that yields a simple linear estimator. We show that both surrogates can achieve MSE comparable to Poisson MAP in the low-dose regime, despite departing from the Poisson likelihood. Numerical computed tomography experiments indicate that these conclusions extend beyond the stylized setting of our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Variational inference via radial transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In variational inference (VI), the practitioner approximates a high-dimensional distribution $\pi$ with a simple surrogate one, often a (product) Gaussian distribution. However, in many cases of practical interest, Gaussian distributions might not capture the correct radial profile of $\pi$, resulting in poor coverage. In this work, we approach the VI problem from the perspective of optimizing over these radial profiles. Our algorithm radVI is a cheap, effective add-on to many existing VI schemes, such as Gaussian (mean-field) VI and Laplace approximation. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for our algorithm, owing to recent developments in optimization over the Wasserstein space--the space of probability distributions endowed with the Wasserstein distance--and new regularity properties of radial transport maps in the style of Caffarelli (2000).</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Modular Learning of Robust Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale generative models is resource-intensive and relies heavily on heuristic dataset weighting. We address two fundamental questions: Can we train Large Language Models (LLMs) modularly-combining small, domain-specific experts to match monolithic performance-and can we do so robustly for any data mixture, eliminating heuristic tuning? We present a theoretical framework for modular generative modeling where a set of pre-trained experts are combined via a gating mechanism. We define the space of normalized gating functions, $G_{1}$, and formulate the problem as a minimax game to find a single robust gate that minimizes divergence to the worst-case data mixture. We prove the existence of such a robust gate using Kakutani's fixed-point theorem and show that modularity acts as a strong regularizer, with generalization bounds scaling with the lightweight gate's complexity. Furthermore, we prove that this modular approach can theoretically outperform models retrained on aggregate data, with the gap characterized by the Jensen-Shannon Divergence. Finally, we introduce a scalable Stochastic Primal-Dual algorithm and a Structural Distillation method for efficient inference. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm that our modular architecture effectively mitigates gradient conflict and can robustly outperform monolithic baselines.</description>

      <title>Optimal Unconstrained Self-Distillation in Ridge Regression: Strict Improvements, Precise Asymptotics, and One-Shot Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD) is the process of retraining a student on a mixture of ground-truth labels and the teacher's own predictions using the same architecture and training data. Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $\xi$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $\lambda &gt; 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(\lambda)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(\lambda) \neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $\xi^\star(\lambda)$ for any value of $\lambda$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\operatorname{sign}(\xi^\star(\lambda))=-\operatorname{sign}(R'(\lambda))$. In particular, $\xi^\star(\lambda)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $\xi^\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Blackwell Approachability and Applications to Multiclass Omniprediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Omniprediction is a learning problem that requires suboptimality bounds for each of a family of losses $\mathcal{L}$ against a family of comparator predictors $\mathcal{C}$. We initiate the study of omniprediction in a multiclass setting, where the comparator family $\mathcal{C}$ may be infinite. Our main result is an extension of the recent binary omniprediction algorithm of [OKK25] to the multiclass setting, with sample complexity (in statistical settings) or regret horizon (in online settings) $\approx \varepsilon^{-(k+1)}$, for $\varepsilon$-omniprediction in a $k$-class prediction problem. En route to proving this result, we design a framework of potential broader interest for solving Blackwell approachability problems where multiple sets must simultaneously be approached via coupled actions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Sequential Testing with Markovian Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-sided and $\alpha$-correct sequential hypothesis testing for data generated by an ergodic Markov chain. The null hypothesis is that the unknown transition matrix belongs to a prescribed set $P$ of stochastic matrices, and the alternative corresponds to a disjoint set $Q$. We establish a tight non-asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the expected stopping time of any valid sequential test under the alternative. Our novel analysis improves the existing lower bounds, which are either asymptotic or provably sub-optimal in this setting. Our lower bound incorporates both the stationary distribution and the transition structure induced by the unknown Markov chain. We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $\alpha \to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes. Our findings yield a sharp and general characterization of optimal sequential testing procedures under Markovian dependence.</description>

      <title>Towards Anytime-Valid Statistical Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates efficient mechanisms to distinguish machine-generated content from human text. While statistical watermarking has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: the lack of a principled approach for selecting sampling distributions and the reliance on fixed-horizon hypothesis testing, which precludes valid early stopping. In this paper, we bridge this gap by developing the first e-value-based watermarking framework, Anchored E-Watermarking, that unifies optimal sampling with anytime-valid inference. Unlike traditional approaches where optional stopping invalidates Type-I error guarantees, our framework enables valid, anytime-inference by constructing a test supermartingale for the detection process. By leveraging an anchor distribution to approximate the target model, we characterize the optimal e-value with respect to the worst-case log-growth rate and derive the optimal expected stopping time. Our theoretical claims are substantiated by simulations and evaluations on established benchmarks, showing that our framework can significantly enhance sample efficiency, reducing the average token budget required for detection by 13-15% relative to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>When to Trust the Cheap Check: Weak and Strong Verification for Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.</description>

      <title>Input-Label Correlation Governs a Linear-to-Nonlinear Transition in Random Features under Spiked Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random feature models (RFMs), two-layer networks with a randomly initialized fixed first layer and a trained linear readout, are among the simplest nonlinear predictors. Prior asymptotic analyses in the proportional high-dimensional regime show that, under isotropic data, RFMs reduce to noisy linear models and offer no advantage over classical linear methods such as ridge regression. Yet RFMs frequently outperform linear baselines on structured real data. We show that this tension is explained by a correlation-driven phase transition: under spiked-covariance designs, the interaction between anisotropy and input-label correlation determines whether the RFM behaves as an effectively linear predictor or exhibits genuinely nonlinear gains. Concretely, we establish a universality principle under anisotropy and characterize the RFM generalization error via an equivalent noisy polynomial model. The effective degree of this polynomial, equivalently, which Hermite orders of the activation survive, is governed by the strength of input-label correlation, yielding an explicit boundary in the correlation-spike-magnitude plane. Below the boundary, the RFM collapses to a linear surrogate and can underperform strong linear baselines; above it, higher-order terms persist and the RFM achieves a clear nonlinear advantage. Numerical simulations and real-data experiments corroborate the theory and delineate the transition between these two regimes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Predictive Uncertainty: Reliable Representation Learning with Structural Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation in machine learning has traditionally focused on the prediction stage, aiming to quantify confidence in model outputs while treating learned representations as deterministic and reliable by default. In this work, we challenge this implicit assumption and argue that reliability should be regarded as a first-class property of learned representations themselves. We propose a principled framework for reliable representation learning that explicitly models representation-level uncertainty and leverages structural constraints as inductive biases to regularize the space of feasible representations. Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods.</description>

      <title>Fixed Budget is No Harder Than Fixed Confidence in Best-Arm Identification up to Logarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The best-arm identification (BAI) problem is one of the most fundamental problems in interactive machine learning, which has two flavors: the fixed-budget setting (FB) and the fixed-confidence setting (FC).
  For $K$-armed bandits with the unique best arm, the optimal sample complexities for both settings have been settled down, and they match up to logarithmic factors.
  This prompts an interesting research question about the generic, potentially structured BAI problems: Is FB harder than FC or the other way around?
  In this paper, we show that FB is no harder than FC up to logarithmic factors.
  We do this constructively: we propose a novel algorithm called FC2FB (fixed confidence to fixed budget), which is a meta algorithm that takes in an FC algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ and turn it into an FB algorithm.
  We prove that this FC2FB enjoys a sample complexity that matches, up to logarithmic factors, that of the sample complexity of $\mathcal{A}$.
  This means that the optimal FC sample complexity is an upper bound of the optimal FB sample complexity up to logarithmic factors.
  Our result not only reveals a fundamental relationship between FB and FC, but also has a significant implication: FC2FB, combined with existing state-of-the-art FC algorithms, leads to improved sample complexity for a number of FB problems.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Learning Theory: Uncovering the Mechanisms of Trainability and Generalization in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a notion of practical learnability grounded in finite sample settings, and develop a conjugate learning theoretical framework based on convex conjugate duality to characterize this learnability property. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) achieves global optima of empirical risk by jointly controlling the extreme eigenvalues of a structure matrix and the gradient energy, and we establish a corresponding convergence theorem. We further elucidate the impact of batch size and model architecture (including depth, parameter count, sparsity, skip connections, and other characteristics) on non-convex optimization. Additionally, we derive a model-agnostic lower bound for the achievable empirical risk, theoretically demonstrating that data determines the fundamental limit of trainability. On the generalization front, we derive deterministic and probabilistic bounds on generalization error based on generalized conditional entropy measures. The former explicitly delineates the range of generalization error, while the latter characterizes the distribution of generalization error relative to the deterministic bounds under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sampling conditions. Furthermore, these bounds explicitly quantify the influence of three key factors: (i) information loss induced by irreversibility in the model, (ii) the maximum attainable loss value, and (iii) the generalized conditional entropy of features with respect to labels. Moreover, they offer a unified theoretical lens for understanding the roles of regularization, irreversible transformations, and network depth in shaping the generalization behavior of deep neural networks. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical predictions, confirming the framework's correctness and consistency.</description>

Abstract: This note gives a self-contained overview of some important properties of the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, compared with the standard linear optimal transport (OT) framework. More specifically, I explore the following questions: are GW optimal transport plans sparse? Under what conditions are they supported on a permutation? Do they satisfy a form of cyclical monotonicity? In particular, I present the conditionally negative semi-definite property and show that, when it holds, there are GW optimal plans that are sparse and supported on a permutation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of contextual information in the online learning problem of brokerage between traders. In this sequential problem, at each time step, two traders arrive with secret valuations about an asset they wish to trade. The learner (a broker) suggests a trading (or brokerage) price based on contextual data about the asset and the market conditions. Then, the traders reveal their willingness to buy or sell based on whether their valuations are higher or lower than the brokerage price. A trade occurs if one of the two traders decides to buy and the other to sell, i.e., if the broker's proposed price falls between the smallest and the largest of their two valuations. We design algorithms for this problem and prove optimal theoretical regret guarantees under various standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator in logistic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression is a classical model for describing the probabilistic dependence of binary responses to multivariate covariates. We consider the predictive performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for logistic regression, assessed in terms of logistic risk. We consider two questions: first, that of the existence of the MLE (which occurs when the dataset is not linearly separated), and second, that of its accuracy when it exists. These properties depend on both the dimension of covariates and the signal strength. In the case of Gaussian covariates and a well-specified logistic model, we obtain sharp non-asymptotic guarantees for the existence and excess logistic risk of the MLE. We then generalize these results in two ways: first, to non-Gaussian covariates satisfying a certain two-dimensional margin condition, and second to the general case of statistical learning with a possibly misspecified logistic model. Finally, we consider the case of a Bernoulli design, where the behavior of the MLE is highly sensitive to the parameter direction.</description>

      <title>Rex: A Family of Reversible Exponential (Stochastic) Runge-Kutta Solvers</title>

Abstract: Deep generative models based on neural differential equations have quickly become the state-of-the-art for numerous generation tasks across many different applications. These models rely on ODE/SDE solvers which integrate from a prior distribution to the data distribution. In many applications it is highly desirable to then integrate in the other direction. The standard solvers, however, accumulate discretization errors which don't align with the forward trajectory, thereby prohibiting an exact inversion. In applications where the precision of the generative model is paramount this inaccuracy in inversion is often unacceptable. Current approaches to solving the inversion of these models results in significant downstream issues with poor stability and low-order of convergence; moreover, they are strictly limited to the ODE domain. In this work, we propose a new family of reversible exponential (stochastic) Runge-Kutta solvers which we refer to as Rex developed by an application of Lawson methods to convert any explicit (stochastic) Runge-Kutta scheme into a reversible one. In addition to a rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed solvers, we also empirically demonstrate the utility of Rex on improving the sampling of Boltzmann distributions with flow models, and improving image generation and editing capabilities with diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Capturing Individual Human Preferences with Reward Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback usually models preferences using a reward function that does not distinguish between people. We argue that this is unlikely to be a good design choice in contexts with high potential for disagreement, like in the training of large language models. We formalise and analyse the problem of learning a reward model that can be specialised to a user. Using the principle of empirical risk minimisation, we derive a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound showing the dependency of the approximation error on the number of training examples, as usual, and also on the number of human raters who provided feedback on them. Based on our theoretical findings, we discuss how to best collect pairwise preference data and argue that adaptive reward models should be beneficial when there is considerable disagreement among users. We also propose a concrete architecture for an adaptive reward model. Our approach leverages the observation that individual preferences can be captured as a linear combination of a set of general reward features. We show how to learn such features and subsequently use them to quickly adapt the reward model to a specific individual, even if their preferences are not reflected in the training data. We present experiments with large language models illustrating our theoretical results and comparing the proposed architecture with a non-adaptive baseline. Consistent with our analysis, the benefits provided by our model increase with the number of raters and the heterogeneity of their preferences. We also show that our model compares favourably to adaptive counterparts, including those performing in-context personalisation.</description>

      <title>Ringleader ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities. Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Sample Complexity of Learning for Blind Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide a theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results of the reconstruction error under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Robust Machine Learning for Regulatory Sequence Modeling under Biological and Technical Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust machine learning for regulatory genomics is studied under biologically and technically induced distribution shifts. Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates.</description>

      <title>Universal Coefficients and Mayer-Vietoris Sequence for Groupoid Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homology of ample groupoids via the compactly supported Moore complex of the nerve. Let $A$ be a topological abelian group. For $n\ge 0$ set $C_n(\mathcal G;A) := C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$ and define $\partial_n^A=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i(d_i)_*$. This defines $H_n(\mathcal G;A)$. The theory is functorial for continuous \'etale homomorphisms. It is compatible with standard reductions, including restriction to saturated clopen subsets. In the ample setting it is invariant under Kakutani equivalence. We reprove Matui type long exact sequences and identify the comparison maps at chain level. For discrete $A$ we prove a natural universal coefficient short exact sequence $$0\to H_n(\mathcal G)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\xrightarrow{\ \iota_n^{\mathcal G}\ }H_n(\mathcal G;A)\xrightarrow{\ \kappa_n^{\mathcal G}\ }\operatorname{Tor}_1^{\mathbb Z}\bigl(H_{n-1}(\mathcal G),A\bigr)\to 0.$$ The key input is the chain level isomorphism $C_c(\mathcal G_n,\mathbb Z)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\cong C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$, which reduces the groupoid statement to the classical algebraic UCT for the free complex $C_c(\mathcal G_\bullet,\mathbb Z)$. We also isolate the obstruction for non-discrete coefficients. For a locally compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $X$ with a basis of compact open sets, the image of $\Phi_X:C_c(X,\mathbb Z)\otimes_{\mathbb Z}A\to C_c(X,A)$ is exactly the compactly supported functions with finite image. Thus $\Phi_X$ is surjective if and only if every $f\in C_c(X,A)$ has finite image, and for suitable $X$ one can produce compactly supported continuous maps $X\to A$ with infinite image. Finally, for a clopen saturated cover $\mathcal G_0=U_1\cup U_2$ we construct a short exact sequence of Moore complexes and derive a Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequence for $H_\bullet(\mathcal G;A)$ for explicit computations.</description>

      <title>Logit Distance Bounds Representational Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.</description>
