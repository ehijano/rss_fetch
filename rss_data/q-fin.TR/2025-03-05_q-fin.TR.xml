      <title>To Hedge or Not to Hedge: Optimal Strategies for Stochastic Trade Flow Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the trade-off between internalisation and externalisation in the management of stochastic trade flows. We consider agents who must absorb flows and manage risk by deciding whether to warehouse it or hedge in the market, thereby incurring transaction costs and market impact. Unlike market makers, these agents cannot skew their quotes to attract offsetting flows and deter risk-increasing ones, leading to a fundamentally different problem. Within the Almgren-Chriss framework, we derive almost-closed-form solutions in the case of quadratic execution costs, while more general cases require numerical methods. In particular, we discuss the challenges posed by artificial boundary conditions when using classical grid-based numerical PDE techniques and propose reinforcement learning methods as an alternative.</description>

      <title>Leveraging IS and TC: Optimal order execution subject to reference strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of meta order execution from a broker-dealer's point of view in Almgren-Chriss model under execution risk. A broker-dealer agency is authorized to execute an order of trading on some client's behalf. The strategies that the agent is allowed to deploy is subject to a benchmark, referred to as the reference strategy, regulated by the client. We formulate the broker's problem as a utility maximization problem in which the broker seeks to maximize his utility of excess profit-and-loss at the execution horizon, of which optimal feedback strategies are obtained in closed form. In the absence of execution risk, the optimal strategies subject to reference strategies are deterministic. We establish an affine structure among the trading trajectories under optimal strategies subject to general reference strategies using implementation shortfall (IS) and target close (TC) orders as basis. Furthermore, an approximation theorem is proposed to show that with small error, general reference strategies can be approximated by piece-wise constant ones, of which the optimal strategy is piece-wise linear combination between IS and TC orders. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments illustrating the trading trajectories as well as histograms of terminal wealth and utility at investment horizon under optimal strategies versus those under TWAP strategies.</description>

      <title>Shifting Power: Leveraging LLMs to Simulate Human Aversion in ABMs of Bilateral Financial Exchanges, A bond market study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bilateral markets, such as those for government bonds, involve decentralized and opaque transactions between market makers (MMs) and clients, posing significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into agent-based models to enhance client agency is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial societies.</description>
