      <title>Hybrid Approaches for Black Hole Spin Estimation: From Classical Spectroscopy to Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of black hole spin is considered one of the key problems in relativistic astrophysics. Existing methods, such as continuum fitting, X-ray reflection spectroscopy, and quasi-periodic oscillation analysis, suffer from limitations in accuracy, interpretability, and scalability. In this work, a hybrid approach is proposed in which theoretical models based on the Teukolsky formalism are integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). A PINN model is developed to solve the linearized spin problem in the scalar case, with physical constraints directly embedded into the training process. Annotated data are not required; instead, the model is trained using the differential operator and boundary conditions as supervision. It is demonstrated that the PINN converges reliably, with residual loss values below 10 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) on the order of $10^{-7}$. Benchmarking results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and data-driven machine learning approaches in terms of AUC and sensitivity, while also exhibiting superior interpretability, generalizability, and adherence to physical principles, with moderate computational cost. Potential extensions include integration with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) solvers and application to real observational data. These findings support the viability of physics-based machine learning as a robust framework for accurate and interpretable black hole spin estimation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Origins of Optical Variability in AGNs: Correlations with Black Hole Properties, X-ray, and Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optical variability characteristics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN catalogue by utilising approximately five years of optical light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. We investigate dependencies of the long-term optical variability amplitudes and timescales on (i) supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, luminosity, and Eddington ratio to explore the influence of accretion disk dynamics and radiative processes; (ii) X-ray properties, such as spectral photon indices and fluxes, to study the effect of high-energy emission mechanisms; and (iii) radio characteristics, such as integrated fluxes and radio loudness, which indicate jet activity. Our findings confirm a positive correlation between the variability time scale and both the SMBH mass and luminosity, suggesting that these physical parameters significantly impact the optical variability timescale. Conversely, no significant dependence is found between optical variability and X-ray properties, indicating that high-energy processes may not substantially influence long-term optical variability. Additionally, a weak anti-correlation between optical variability and radio parameters suggests that jet activity has a negligible effect on causing long-term AGN variability. These results support the hypothesis that long-term optical variability in AGN is primarily governed by thermal emission from the accretion disk. Further investigations with larger samples are essential to refine these correlations and develop robust physical models integrating black hole properties, accretion disk physics, and multi-wavelength radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf in M101: physical parameters from bolometric light curve modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new photometric observations of the core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf occurred in M101, taken with the RC80 and BRC80 robotic telescopes in Hungary. The initial nickel mass from the late-phase bolometric light curve extending up to 400 days after explosion, is inferred as $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.046 \pm 0.007$ M$_\odot$. The comparison of the bolometric light curve with models from hydrodynamical simulations as well as semi-analytic radiative diffusion codes reveals a relatively low-mass ejecta of $M_{\rm ej} \lesssim 9$ M$_\odot$, contrary to SN~2017eaw, another H-rich core-collapse event, which had $M_{\rm ej} \gtrsim 15$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Millisecond Pulsars in M2: New discoveries and a detailed timing analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) offer a unique environment for discovering and studying millisecond pulsars. In this paper, we present a multi-epoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G, respectively. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures, flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first rotation measure at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10\,Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central-stellar-velocity dispersion measurement in M2.</description>

      <title>Shear Particle Acceleration in Structured Gamma-Ray Burst Jets: III. The Radiation Physics of Bright Prompt Optical Flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation physics of bright prompt optical emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a puzzle. Assuming that the GRB ejecta is structured, we investigated this issue by characterizing the ejecta as an ultra-relativistic uniform jet core surrounded by a mild-relativistic cocoon. The mixed jet-cocoon (MJC) region can accelerate particles through the shear acceleration mechanism. Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra MeV-GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV-MeV band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core. Our model reasonably represents the extremely bright optical flash and spectral characteristics of GRBs 990123, 080319B, and 130427A. The inferred magnetic field strength of the MJC region is above $10^{5}$ G, potentially suggesting that the jets of these GRBs are highly magnetized.</description>

      <title>Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search. VIII. Pulsar with a period of 40.9~s in observations of the LPA LPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search has been carried out for the pulsar J0311+1402, which has a period of $P = 40.9$ s, in the data archive of the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. When searching using fast folding algorithm (FFA), periodic pulsar radiation at a frequency of 111 MHz was not detected. In 3321 observation sessions lasting 5 minutes, 35 strong pulses were detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 10. Some of the pulses have a complex multi-peak structure consisting of narrow details, while some of the pulses are single-component. The peak flux densities of the details of these strong pulses range from 2 to 11 Jy. The peak value ($S_{\rm p} = 2$\,Jy) and the integral ($S_{\rm i} = 7$\,mJy) flux density in the average profile were obtained from the strong pulses. It is shown that pulsar pulses in the meter-wavelength range arrive sporadically, and the pulsar is similar in its properties to a rotating radio transient (RRAT). The pulsar has the minimal dispersion measure, the minimal distance from the Sun, and the minimal pseudo-luminosity of all known pulsars. Pulsar timing made it possible to improve the previously obtained value of the period ($P$) and to estimate the period derivative ($\dot P$). In the dependency of timing residuals (TRs) from the times of arrival (TOA) of pulses discontinuities are visible, when no pulses were observed. The duration of these breaks can be hundreds of days.</description>

      <title>EPOS.LHC-R : a global approach to solve the muon puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadron production in the simulation of extensive air showers is a long standing problem and the origin of large uncertainties in the reconstruction of the mass of the high energy primary cosmic rays. Hadronic interaction models re-tuned after early LHC data give more consistent results among each other compared to the first generation of models, but still can't reproduce extended air shower data (EAS) consistently resulting in the so-called "muon puzzle". Using more recent LHC data like in the QGSJET-III model improve further the description of EAS by such a model but is not enough to resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, the EPOS project is a theoretical global approach aiming at describing data from very fundamental electron-positron interactions to central heavy ions collisions. We will demonstrate that this approach can provide new constraints, changing the correlation between the measured data at mid-rapidity and the predicted particle production at large rapidities, which drive the EAS development. Thus, using the same accelerator data, different predictions are obtained in air shower simulations in much better agreement with the current air shower data (for both the maximum shower development depth Xmax and the energy spectrum of the muons at ground). Using the EPOS LHC-R model, the detailed changes will be addressed and their consequences on EAS observable at various energies.</description>

      <title>The 300 TeV photon from GRB 221009A: a Hint at Non-linear Lorentz Invariance Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</description>

      <title>Evidence for an intrinsic luminosity-decay correlation in GRB radio afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a correlation, in a sample of 16 gamma-ray burst 8.5 GHz radio afterglows, between the intrinsic luminosity measured at 10 days in the rest frame, $L_{\mathrm{Radio,10d}}$, and the average rate of decay past this time, $\alpha_{&gt;10d}$. The correlation has a Spearman's rank coefficient of $-0.70 \pm 0.13$ at a significance of $&gt;3\sigma$ and a linear regression fit of $\alpha_{&gt;10d} = -0.29^{+0.19}_{-0.28} \log \left(L_{\mathrm{Radio,10d}} \right) + 8.12^{+8.86}_{-5.88}$. This finding suggests that more luminous radio afterglows have higher average rates of decay than less luminous ones. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to show the correlation is not produced by chance or selection effects at a confidence level of $&gt;3\sigma$. Previous studies found this relation in optical/UV, X-ray and GeV afterglow light curves, and we have now extended it to radio light curves. The Spearman's rank coefficients and the linear regression slopes for the correlation in each waveband are all consistent within $1\sigma$. We discuss how these new results in the radio band support the effects of observer viewing geometry, and time-varying microphysical parameters, as possible causes of the correlation as suggested in previous works.</description>

      <title>X-ray studies of PSR J1838$-$0655 and its wind nebula associated with HESS J1837$-$069 and 1LHAASO J1837$-$0654u</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, NICER, and NuSTAR to characterize the properties of the pulsar PSR J1838$-$0655 and its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with HESS J1837$-$069. Based on 5.5 years of NICER monitoring, we detected a glitch around MJD 59300, characterized by a fractional frequency jump of approximately $2\times 10^{-6}$. We constructed semi-phase-coherent timing solutions for pre- and post-glitch epochs, allowing for phase alignment of multi-instrument data and a subsequent measurement of the pulsed spectrum of the pulsar. This analysis confirmed previously-reported spectral curvature and revealed a peak energy of $73^{+85}_{-26}$ keV in the pulsar's spectral energy distribution (SED), based on a logpar model fit of the pulsed spectrum. We discuss these findings within the framework of pulsar magnetospheric emission scenarios. The PWN's X-ray spectrum is well-described by a power law with a photon index of $2.1\pm0.3$, softer than previously-reported measurements. We also characterized the X-ray emission from another extended X-ray source AX J1837.3$-$0652 within the extent of HESS J1837$-$069. Based on the spatial and spectral properties of these X-ray sources, we propose a leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1837$-$069 and demonstrate its feasibility through SED modeling. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model results and alternative scenarios for the gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among various host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and the production of transients. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies to date, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H) = 8.04-8.84) for 40 hosts using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies matched in the same selection criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide range in metallicity and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of the star-forming galaxy population. Contrary to the earlier claim in the literature, we find no clear lower bound on metallicity, suggesting that metallicity alone does not strictly regulate FRB production. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can form even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09 $\pm$ 0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation, likely due to suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. This offset resembles that observed in local post-merger galaxies, and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions, where FRB progenitors formed during the starburst produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, consistent with observed delay-time distributions and favoring binary evolution channels over core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Two Decades of GRB Observations: Assessing Missed Very High-Energy Detections and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are bright flashes of electromagnetic radiation originating from the core collapse of massive stars or the merger of compact objects. It has long been theorized that GRBs can emit very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays that can reach the TeV level. Although current-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), such as H.E.S.S., have been observing GRBs since 2002, the first detection of GRBs by IACTs occurred only 16 years later, in 2018, raising the question of why no detections were made during these years. We investigate all GRBs detected by the Swift Observatory with redshift measurements over the past two decades. Using the phenomenological relationship between X-ray and gamma rays and taking into consideration extragalactic background light absorption effects and instrument response functions, we search for any missed opportunities for GRBs that could have been detected by the three IACTs: H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, and present the best candidates. We find that the missing detections can be explained by the low rate of detectable GRBs at VHE, which we quantify as &lt; 1 per year. We also find that with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), this rate can increase to 4 per year.</description>

      <title>Probing the energy-dependent temporal nature of MAXI J1803-298 with AstroSat and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the spectral and temporal analysis of MAXI J1803-298 using AstroSat/LAXPC and NICER observations taken in May 2021 during the initial phase of the outburst. We found that the source traverses through the hard, intermediate, and soft spectral states during the outburst. The spectrum in all states can be described using soft emissions from the thermal disk and hard emissions from the coronal regions. The variation in the inner disk temperature and normalization of the disk indicates the motion of the truncated disk across these different spectral states. We confirmed the presence of broad features, Type-C, and Type-B QPOs in the power spectra of different spectral states. We investigated the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and discovered that the lag swung between positive and negative during the outburst evolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers variations in accretion parameters such as the accretion rate, heating rate, and inner disk radius, along with delays between them, we found a dynamic reversal in the origin of variability between the corona and the disk. Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study conducted on this source during its outburst.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and Electromagnetic Signals from Tidal Disruption Events: Bridging the Theory with Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceeding presents recent results from a joint analysis of time-dependent neutrino and electromagnetic emissions from tidal disruption events (TDEs), using both isotropic wind models and relativistic jets. We discuss constraints from Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\gamma$-ray upper limits on the size of the radiation zone and the maximum energies of accelerated cosmic rays, as well as the resulting neutrino productions from TDEs and candidates, including AT 2019dsg, AT 2019fdr, AT 2019aalc, and AT 2021lwx. The Fermi upper limits correspond to a generic neutrino detection rate of $\lesssim0.01-0.1$ per TDE. Additionally, we explore multi-wavelength modeling of jetted TDEs with luminous X-ray afterglows, another TDE subclass, by incorporating the dynamics of structured jets with time-dependent energy injection. We also examine the connection between neutrinos and their multi-wavelength counterparts, highlighting implications for future multi-messenger discoveries with IceCube, IceCube-Gen2, KM3NeT, and Fermi-LAT.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Strongly Magnetized Eccentric Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the imprint of magnetic fields on gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral phase of eccentric binary neutron star systems. While observations indicate that neutron stars typically exhibit strong magnetic fields in the range of $10^{14}$-$10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$, theoretical models allow for fields as high as $ \sim 10^{17-18}\,\mathrm{G}$. In binaries, the fate of these fields depends on the formation pathway: in systems formed through isolated evolution, magnetic fields may decay over long inspiral timescales. In contrast, binaries formed via dynamical capture can retain substantial eccentricity and strong fields until merger, potentially altering the gravitational waveform. We consider two magnetic effects: magnetic interaction between the neutron stars and electromagnetic radiation from the system's effective dipole, and identify regimes where each dominates. Using a perturbative framework, we compute the associated energy loss and gravitational wave phase evolution. We find that for binaries with strong and comparable magnetic fields, $10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields may be detectable up to $\sim 10 \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ with DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope, while $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields extend the reach to several hundred Mpc. For extreme fields of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$, third-generation detectors could be sensitive out to Gpc scales. In contrast, LIGO is limited to galactic distances: $10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ fields are detectable only within $\sim 100\,\mathrm{kpc}$, and only ultrastrong fields ($\sim 10^{16}$-$10^{17}\,\mathrm{G}$) are potentially observable at Gpc distances. In highly asymmetric systems, where dipole radiation dominates, the gravitational wave dephasing is significantly suppressed, reducing the detection horizon. These findings suggest that current and future gravitational wave observatories may be capable of identifying magnetized binary systems.</description>

      <title>Resonant interactions from dynamical perturbers on generic orbits around an extreme mass ratio inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are binary systems where a compact object slowly inspirals into its much larger compact partner. Since we anticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the galactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying these environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field regime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the mHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors. However, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs could be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze potential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance. We use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this series [Silva \&amp; Hirata, {\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)] and expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for multiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH spins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions across a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause changes to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead to potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian. Detectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could be a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing accurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and pipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various perturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing more accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and test theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.</description>

      <title>Entering the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow realm in Symbiotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a suite of dynamical simulations designed to explore the orbital and accretion properties of compact (2--7 AU) symbiotic systems, focusing on wind accretion, drag forces, and tidal interactions. Using three levels of physical complexity, we model systems of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with masses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.2 M$_\odot$ orbiting evolving Solar-like stars with 1, 2, and 3 M$_\odot$. We show that systems alternate between standard wind accretion and Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLO) regimes during periods of high mass-loss rate experienced by the donor star (the peak of red giant phase and/or thermal pulses). For some configurations, the standard wind accretion has mass accretion efficiencies similar to those obtained by WRLO regime. Tidal forces play a key role in compact systems, leading to orbital shrinkage and enhanced accretion efficiency. We find that systems with high-mass WDs ($\geq 1$ M$_\odot$) and massive donors (2--3 M$_\odot$) are the only ones to reach the Chandrasekhar limit. Interestingly, the majority of our simulations reach the Roche lobe overflow condition that is not further simulated given the need of more complex hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis shows that increasing physical realism, by including drag and tides, systematically leads to more compact final orbital configurations. Comparison with compact known symbiotic systems seems to suggest that they are very likely experiencing orbital decay produced by tidal forces.</description>

      <title>Confronting General Relativity with Principal Component Analysis: Simulations and Results from GWTC-3 Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational wave signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Inside the Stagnation Radius of the Nearest Billion-Solar-Mass Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the NSF Jansky Very Large Array at a frequency $\nu =$ 22\,GHz to study the nearest billion-solar-mass black hole, in the early-type galaxy NGC\,3115 at a distance of 9.7\,Mpc. We localize a faint continuum nucleus, with flux density $S_{\rm 22\,GHz} = 48.2\pm6.4\,\mu$Jy, to a FWHM diameter $d_{\rm 22\,GHz} &lt;$ 59\,mas (2.8\,pc). We find no evidence for adjacent emission within a stagnation region of radius $R_{\rm sta} \sim$ 360\,mas (17\,pc) identified in a recent hydrodynamic simulation tailored to NGC\,3115. Within that region, the simulated gas flow developed into an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The nucleus' luminosity density $L_{\rm 22\,GHz} = 5.4 \times 10^{17}\,\rm W\,Hz^{-1}$ is about 60 times that of Sagittarius\,A$^\star$. The nucleus' spectral index $\alpha_{\rm 10\,GHz}^{\rm 22\,GHz} = -1.85\pm0.18$ ($S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) indicates optically-thin synchrotron emission. The spectral energy distribution of the nucleus peaks near $\nu_{\rm peak} =$ 9\,GHz. Modeling this radio peak as an ADAF implies a black hole mass $M_{\rm ADAF} = (1.2\pm0.2) \times 10^9\,M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates of $(1-2) \times 10^9\,M_\odot$ from stellar or hot-gas dynamics. Also, the Eddington-scaled accretion rate for NGC\,3115, $\dot{M}_{\rm ADAF}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd} = 1.2^{+1.0}_{-0.6} \times 10^{-8}$, is about 4-8 times lower than recent estimates for Sagittarius\,A$^\star$.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Mass Shell Model for Compact Binaries with Observed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent study modeled coalescing compact binaries as a spinning and contracting mass shell geometry, reinterpreting the effective one-body model. Besides obtaining the respective waveform profiles that include rates of change in binary separation and orbital frequency, an expression for the mass-shell surface energy was derived to compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves. In this study, we revisit the surface energy derivation using a variational method that was recently used, and we recover the energy's dependence on the compact binary's reduced mass, symmetric mass ratio, and the normalized rotational speed at merger. For 31 out of 93 cataloged GW events within the O1, O2 and O3 observation runs, we compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves and compare these values with the observed energy, either directly measured or extracted from the total-minus-remnant mass difference. It is shown that the model presented in this work agrees well with observed energy measurements, within the error range and via 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ across 29 example events (the mean value of these 29 ratios being $0.941$), with GW190403_051519 serving as an outlier with the 1:1 ratio of $0.462$, demonstrating the precision and universality of the energy expression to be applied to current and future detections.</description>

      <title>The role of rotation on the yields of the two {\gamma}-ray emitters 26Al and 60Fe ejected by massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the observed 60Fe/26Al flux ratio provided by the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL satellite (0.24 +- 0.04) can be reproduced only if rotation is taken into account in the computation of the stellar models. Predictions from non-rotating stellar models yield to a significantly lower ratio (0.062), which is incompatible with the observed value. The adopted models and the associated yields are based on a combination of models already published by Limongi &amp; Chieffi (2018) complemented by additional ones fully consistent with the original grid, allowing a finer resolution in the initial rotational velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength study of extreme variability in LEDA 1154204: A changing-look event in a type 1.9 Seyfert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Multiwavelength studies of transients in actively accreting supermassive black holes have revealed that large-amplitude variability is frequently linked to significant changes in the optical spectra -- a phenomenon known as changing-look AGN (CLAGN).} Aims. In 2020, the Zwicky Transient Facility detected a transient flaring event in the type 1.9 AGN LEDA 1154204, wherein brightness sharply increased by 0.55 mag in one month, then began to decay. Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)/eROSITA also observed the object as part of its all-sky X-ray surveys, after the flare had started decaying. Methods. We performed a three-year, multiwavelength follow-up campaign to track the source's spectral and temporal characteristics, during the post-flare fading. This campaign included optical spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and photometry, and UV, optical, and IR continuum photometry. Results. Optical spectra taken near the flare peak revealed a broad double-peaked H$\beta$ emission and a blue continuum, both undetected in a 2005 archival spectrum; broad H$\beta$ had increased by a factor $&gt;$5--6. Then, from late 2020 through 2023, broad Balmer line flux faded as the continuum faded, with Balmer decrement increasing by $\sim$2.2, consistent with the expected ionization response. The X-ray spectrum exhibits no significant spectral variability despite dramatic flux variation -- a factor of 17. There is no evidence of a soft X-ray excess, indicating an energetically unimportant warm corona. Conclusions. The transient event was likely triggered by a disk instability in a pre-existing AGN-like accretion flow, culminating in the observed multiwavelength variability -- X-rays via thermal Comptonization, BLR illumination, and IR dust echo -- and CLAGN event.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>

Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. Different classes of FRBs require different physical mechanisms. If some empirical relations are found for different classes of FRBs, they might justify the classifications scenario and help us to reveal the physical mechanisms behind. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe for cosmology, since their redshifts could be $z\sim 3$ or even higher. Similar to the cosmology of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some empirical relations might also play an important role in the FRB cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were proposed recently. In particular, it was suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young stellar populations, and some empirical relations have also been found for them, respectively. One of these empirical relations (namely $L_\nu-E$ relation) without dispersion measure (DM) has been used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. So, it is of interest to check the empirical relations with the actual data of current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm. This is beneficial to the FRB cosmology.</description>

      <title>A nearby FR I type radio galaxy 3C 120 as a possible PeV neutrino emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although connections between flaring blazars and some IceCube neutrinos have been established, the dominant sources for the bulk extragalactic neutrino emissions are still unclear and one widely suggested candidate is a population of radio galaxies. Because of their relatively low $\gamma$-ray radiation luminosities ($L_\gamma$), it is rather challenging to confirm such a hypothesis with the neutrino/GeV $\gamma$-ray flare association. Here we report on the search for the GeV $\gamma$-ray counterpart of the neutrino IC-180213A and show that the nearby ($z$ = 0.03) broad line radio galaxy 3C 120 is the only known co-spatial GeV $\gamma$-ray source in a half-year epoch around the neutrino detection. An intense $\gamma$-ray flare, the second strongest one among the entire 16-year period, is temporally coincident with the detection of IC-180213A. Moreover, accompanying optical brightenings in $g$-band and $V$-band are observed. We also find that the IC-180213A / 3C 120 association follows the $L_\gamma$-$D_{L}^{2}$ correlation for the neutrino sources (candidates), including NGC 1068 and some blazars. These facts suggest that 3C 120 is a candidate for emitting high-energy neutrinos and may offer an initial evidence for the radio galaxy origin of some PeV neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Insights Into Neutron Stars From Gravitational Redshifts and Universal Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal relations in neutron stars form an essential entity to understand their properties. The moment of inertia, dimensionless tidal deformability, mass quadrupole moment, and oscillation modes are some of the properties that have been studied previously in the context of universal relations. All of these quantities are measurable; thus, analyzing them is of utmost importance. In this article we provide new universal relations in the context of a neutron star's gravitational redshift. Using the redshift measurements of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754, we provide theoretical estimates of moment of inertia, dimensionless tidal deformability, mass quadrupole moment, the mass of the star times the ratio of angular frequency over the spin angular moment, and the average of the speed of sound squared. In the case of the redshift measurement of RX J0720.4-3125, we found that the theoretical estimate using universal relations aligns closely with the Bayesian estimate. Our findings indicate that such theoretical predictions are highly reliable for observations with low uncertainty and can be used as an alternative for statistical analysis. Additionally, we report a violation of the universality of the dimensionless tidal deformability and average of the speed of sound squared with respect to the gravitational redshift. Our calculations further indicate that, under current astrophysical constraints, the maximum gravitational redshift attainable by neutron stars does not exceed $0.763$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Hardening Reveals Afterglow Emergence in Long-Duration Fast X-ray Transients: A Case Study of GRB 250404A/EP250404a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prompt emission and afterglow phases of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been extensively studied, yet the transition between these two phases remains inadequately characterized due to limited multiwavelength observational coverage. Among the recent growing samples of fast X-ray transients observed by Einstein Probe (EP), a subgroup of GRBs are captured with long-duration X-ray emission, potentially containing featured evolution from prompt emission to the afterglow phase. In this Letter, we present a detailed analysis of GRB 250404A/EP250404a, a bright fast X-ray transient detected simultaneously by EP and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor in X-rays and gamma rays. Its continuous X-ray emission reveals a long-duration tail, accompanied by distinct spectral evolution manifested by the spectral index $\alpha_{\rm X}$ with an initial softening, followed by an evident hardening, eventually reaching a plateau at the value of $\sim$ -2. Early optical and near-infrared observations enable broadband modeling with forward- and reverse-shock components, confirming that the X-ray hardening signals the emergence of the external-shock afterglow. From this spectral hardening we infer that the prompt phase in soft X-rays lasted $\sim300\;\mathrm{s}$, which is more than 3 times longer than the gamma-ray $T_{90}$. This well-tracked soft-hard-flat spectral pattern provides a clear indication of afterglow emergence from the fading prompt emission and offers a practical criterion for identifying a distinct population of GRBs among fast X-ray transients, even when the detection of the gamma-ray counterpart or obvious temporal break is absent.</description>

      <title>Temporal evolution of quasi-periodic oscillations in an accreting black hole Swift J1727.8-1613: coevolution of the disk-corona during the state transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed in black hole X-ray binaries, and their frequency has been found to correlate with various energy spectral properties. In this work, we present a detailed timing analysis of Swift J1727.8-1613, revealing a novel two-branch correlation between the QPO frequency and the observed disk emission, which differs from previous findings of a single correlation. Specifically, at QPO frequencies below 3 Hz, the QPO frequency is negatively correlated with the observed disk emission. This negative relation transitions to a positive one, as the QPO frequency exceeds approximately 3 Hz. The correlation between QPO frequency and Compton flux exhibits an opposite trend, with a positive correlation at lower frequencies and a negative correlation at higher ones. We interpret these behaviors as signatures of an evolving disk-corona geometry, within the framework of a Lense-Thirring precessing hot flow. Additionally, we find that during the flare state, the QPO fractional root-mean-square (rms) remains nearly constant above 15 keV, but increases with energy below this threshold. The slope of the rms-energy relation becomes steeper as the energy spectrum softens.</description>

      <title>GRB 240825A: Early Reverse Shock and Its Physical Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early multiwavelength observations offer crucial insights into the nature of the relativistic jets responsible for gamma-ray bursts and their interaction with the surrounding medium.We present data of GRB 240825A from 17 space- and ground-based telescopes/instruments, covering wavelengths from NIR/optical to X-ray and GeV, and spanning from the prompt emission to the afterglow phase triggered by Swift and Fermi. The early afterglow observations were carried out by SVOM/C-GFT, and spectroscopic observations of the afterglow by GTC, VLT, and TNG determined the redshift of the burst ($z = 0.659$) later.A comprehensive analysis of the prompt emission spectrum observed by Swift-BAT and Fermi-GBM/LAT reveals a rare and significant high-energy cutoff at ~76 MeV. Assuming this cutoff is due to $\gamma\gamma$ absorption allows us to place an upper limit on the initial Lorentz factor, $\Gamma_0 &lt; 245$. The optical/NIR and GeV afterglow light curves be described by the standard external shock model, with early-time emission dominated by a reverse shock (RS) and a subsequent transition to forward shock (FS) emission. Our afterglow modelling yields a consistent estimate of the initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm 0} \sim 234$). Furthermore, the RS-to-FS magnetic field ratio ($\mathcal{R}_B \sim 302$) indicates that the reverse shock region is significantly more magnetized than the FS region. An isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of $E_{\text{k,iso}} = 5.25 \times 10^{54}$ erg is derived, and the corresponding $\gamma$-ray radiation efficiency is estimated to be $\eta_{\gamma}$ = 3.1%. On the other hand, the standard afterglow model can not reproduce the X-ray light curve of GRB 240825A, calling for improved models to characterize all multiwavelength data.</description>

      <title>Arcsecond-Scale X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy of SS 433 with Chandra HETG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a spatial and spectral analysis of arcsecond-scale X-ray emission in SS 433 using zeroth-order data from Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations. The analysis is based on 24 observations acquired between 1999 and 2024, comprising a total exposure of $\sim$850 ks and covering a wide range of orbital and precessional phases. Among these, the $\sim$140 ks observation from 2014 was analyzed in detail for this study. This data provides the best statistics and was taken when the jets were nearly perpendicular to the line of sight and the accretion disk was eclipsed. By applying an energy-dependent subpixel event repositioning algorithm and the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution, we enhanced the spatial resolution and revealed eastern and western knot-like structures at a distance of $\sim$1.7 arcsec ($\sim 10^{17}$ cm) from the core. These features are consistent with the kinematic precession model, and the positions of the knots suggest that they were ejected approximately 200 days prior to the observation. A comparison with VLA radio data obtained at a similar precessional phase shows that the X-ray emission extends east-west on a scale comparable to that of the radio emission. While the core is bright in both X-rays and radio, the brightness contrast between the knots and the core is smaller in X-rays than in radio. Spatially resolved spectroscopy indicates that prominent Fe lines in the core X-ray spectrum are well explained by thermal plasma emission. In contrast, Fe lines are not evident in the outer regions after accounting for potential core contamination, suggesting a dominant contribution from non-thermal processes. These findings imply that the arcsecond-scale X-ray structures may vary observationally with viewing conditions or precessional phase, but likely reflect a relatively stable jet-driving mechanism operating within the SS 433 system.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Transonic Shocks around Black Holes and their Future Astrophysical Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical models have long predicted the existence of shocks in multi-transonic accretion flows onto a black hole, yet their fate under realistic general relativistic simulations has not been fully tested. In this study, we present results from high-resolution two-dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of low-angular-momentum accretion flows onto Kerr black holes, focusing on the formation of shocks in transonic accretion flow. We demonstrate that for specific combinations of energy and angular momentum, global shock solutions naturally emerge between multiple sonic points. These shocks are sustained in both corotating and counter-rotating cases, and their locations depend on specific energy, angular momentum, and the spin of the black hole which is in good agreement with analytical solutions. In magnetized flows, weak magnetic fields preserve the shock structure, whereas strong fields suppress it, enhancing turbulence and driving powerful, magnetically dominated jets/outflows. The strength and structure of the outflow also depend on a black hole spin and magnetization, with higher black hole spin parameters leading to faster jets. Shock solutions are found only in super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions, where kinetic forces dominate. Our findings provide important insights into the physics of hot corona formation and jet launching in low-angular-momentum accretion systems such as Sgr~A$^*$ (weak jet/outflow) and X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in dense quark matter environments: A chiral model approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment.</description>

Abstract: In the era of the next-generation gravitational-wave detectors, signal overlaps will become prevalent due to high detection rate and long signal duration, posing significant challenges to data analysis. While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding on the statistical properties for the population of overlapping compact-binary-coalescence signals. For the first time, in order to aid rapid and robust estimation, we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events. This framework is highly extensible, allowing analytical calculation for more complicated scenarios, such as multi-signal overlaps, overlaps between different types of sources, and source-dependent thresholds. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the extended emission line region (EELR) in the host galaxy of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz, utilizing VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. The high spatial-resolution data reveal a bi-conical emission structure approximately $3.7~\mathrm{kpc}$ in scale within the galactic center, characterized by a prominent [OIII] line in the nucleus and significant [NII] line emission extending into the EELR. Spectral analysis of the EELR indicates line ratios consistent with Seyfert ionization in the center and LINER-type ionization in the outer diffuse region, suggesting ionization from galactic nuclear activity. The required ionizing luminosity, estimated from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ and H$\rm{\beta}$ luminosities based on the photoionization and recombination balance assumption, is $10^{41.8}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for all spaxels classified as active galactic nucleus (AGN), and $10^{40.7}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for spaxels in the central $0.9~\mathrm{kpc}$ Seyfert region. However, the current bolometric luminosity of the nucleus $L_{\text{bol}} \leq 10^{40.8}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, estimated from quiescent-state soft X-ray observations, is insufficient to ionize the entire EELR, implying a recently faded AGN or a delayed response to historical activity. Stellar population analysis reveals a post-starburst characteristic in the EELR, and the gas kinematics show disturbances and non-circular components compared to the stellar kinematics. Notably, the recent detection of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in the X-ray light curve of AT2019qiz confirms the TDE-QPE association. Our findings provide direct evidence for an AGN-like EELR in the host galaxy of the nearest TDE with QPE detection, offering new insights into the complex interplay between TDEs, QPEs, AGN activity, and host galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Kadanoff-Baym formalism, we perform a detailed study of neutrino-antineutrino synchrotron emission from strongly magnetized, dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. Starting from an exact expression for the emission rate that fully accounts for Landau-level quantization of quarks, we derive an approximate formula applicable in the regime where quark chemical potentials are much larger than all other relevant energy scales. We demonstrate that the emission rate is largely controlled by a single dimensionless ratio between two low-energy scales: the Landau-level spacing at the Fermi surface, $|e_f B|/\mu_{f}$, and the temperature of the quark matter, $T$. When the ratio $|e_f B|/(\mu_{f} T)$ approaches zero, many closely spaced Landau levels contribute to the emission, but the total rate vanishes as $B\to 0$. In the opposite limit, where the ratio is large, the rate is dominated by transitions between adjacent levels and is exponentially suppressed due to Landau-level quantization, which limits the thermal activation of quarks near the Fermi surface. Our results show that, even in the presence of the strongest magnetic fields expected in compact stars, the synchrotron emission remains suppressed by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the direct Urca process. This implies that such emission is unlikely to play any substantial role in the cooling of magnetized quark stars, at least those made of unpaired quark matter phases.</description>

      <title>Searching for quasinormal modes from Binary Black Hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>Potential science with GW250114 -- the loudest binary black hole merger detected to date</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On January 14, 2025 the LIGO interferometers detected a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, GW250114. Using publicly available information, we estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of GW250114 was $\sim 80$. This would make it three to four times louder than any other gravitational wave detected to date. GW250114 therefore offers a unique opportunity to make precise measurements of its source parameters and to test general relativity. In anticipation of its public data release, we analyze a set of simulated signals that have parameters similar to what we estimate for GW250114 and explore what new insights may be gained from this significant event. We investigate how well the component spins may be constrained, whether any eccentricity may be measured, what quasi-normal modes (QNMs) may be detected in the post-merger signal, how well the black hole area theorem may be constrained, and what constraints may be expected on sub-dominant inspiral-merger-ringdown modes. We find that it should be possible to measure a non-zero eccentricity at $20\,$Hz ($e_{20}$) if GW250114 has $e_{20} \gtrsim 0.05$. We also find that at least one overtone of the dominant QNM should be detectable in the ringdown of GW250114, with a Bayes factor of $O(10^3)$ after marginalizing over all timing uncertainties.</description>

      <title>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of curvature parameters and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>
