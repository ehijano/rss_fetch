      <title>Magnonic Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a new superconducting state with partial spin polarization induced by a magnetic field. This state, which we call "magnonic superconductor", lacks a conventional pairing order parameter, but is characterized instead by a composite order parameter that represents the binding of electron pairs and magnons. We rigorously demonstrate the existence of magnonic superconductivity with high transition temperature in a triangular lattice Hubbard model with repulsive interaction. We further show that magnonic Cooper pairs can attract to form higher-charge bound states, which can give rise to charge-$6e$ superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Edge currents as probe of topology in twisted cuprate bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayers made of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ assembled with a twist angle close to $45^\circ$ have been recently shown to spontaneously break time reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, consistent with theoretical predictions for emergent chiral topological $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ phase in such twisted $d$-wave superconductors. Here we use a minimal microscopic model to estimate the size of spontaneous chiral edge currents expected to occur in the $\mathcal{T}$-broken phase. In accord with previous theoretical studies of chiral $d$-wave superconductors we find small but non-vanishing edge currents which we nevertheless predict to be above the detection threshold of the state-of-the-art magnetic scanning probe microscopy. In addition, by deriving a simple relation between the edge current and the electron spectral function we help elucidate the longstanding disparity between the size of edge currents in chiral $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic relaxation of Campbell penetration depth from creep-enhanced vortex pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of flux creep on the linear AC response of the vortex lattice in a low-pinning Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_13$ superconductor by measuring the Campbell penetration depth, $\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$. Thermal fluctuations release vortices from shallow pinning sites, only for them to become re-trapped by deeper potential wells, causing an initial increase of the effective Labusch parameter, which is proportional to the pinning well depth. This effect cannot be detected in conventional magnetic relaxation measurements but is revealed by our observation of a nonmonotonic time evolution of $\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$, which directly probes the average curvature of the occupied pinning centers. The time evolution of $\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$ was measured at different temperatures in samples with different densities of pinning centers produced by electron irradiation. The $\lambda_\rm \scriptscriptstyle C(T,H,t)$ is hysteretic with a zero-field-cool warmed (ZFCW) state that exhibits a noticeable nonmonotonic relaxation but shows a monotonic change in the field-cooled (FC) state. The curves, measured at different temperatures, can be collapsed together when plotted on a logarithmic time scale $t \to T\ln(t/t_0)$, quantitatively corroborating the proposed picture of vortex creep based on the strong pinning theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin driven Yu-Shiba-Rusinov multiplets and fermion-parity-preserving phase transition in K$_3$C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities in superconductors are of increasing interest due to emergent Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states and Majorana zero modes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, a direct relationship between the YSR multiple states and magnetic anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins remains poorly characterized. By using scanning tunneling microscopy, we resolve systematically individual transition-metal (Fe, Cr and Ni) impurities induced YSR multiplets as well as their Zeeman effects in K$_3$C$_{60}$ superconductor. The YSR multiplets show identical $d$ orbital-like wave functions that are symmetry-mismatched to the threefold K$_3$C$_{60}$(111) host surface, breaking point-group symmetries of the spatial distribution of YSR bound states in real space. Remarkably, we identify an unprecedented fermion-parity-preserving quantum phase transition between ground states with opposite signs of the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that can be manipulated by an external magnetic field. These findings can be readily understood in terms of anisotropy splitting of quantum impurity spins, and thus elucidate the intricate interplay between the magnetic anisotropy and YSR multiplets.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Resistivity upon Freezing of Vortex Liquid in Clean Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting transition, defined as vanishing of the resistivity, under a magnetic field in a clean bulk type II superconductor with weak sample disorder is believed to be a reflection of freezing of the vortex liquid to a kind of vortex solids. This fundamental issue on superconductivity is examined in detail. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a three-dimensional (3D) system and through a supplementary study in 2D case, we find that the resistivity in the weakly disordered 3D case vanishes in a nearly discontinuous way, reflecting growth of the Bragg peaks on approaching the vortex lattice melting transition. In contrast, such a sharp decrease of the resistivity does not clearly appear in the corresponding 2D case. The consequences of this difference in the vanishing behavior of the resistivity between the 2D and 3D systems are discussed in relation to available experimental facts.</description>

      <title>Calculations of magnetic field produced by spin-vortex-induced loop currents in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ thin films using the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory for cuprate superconductivity predicts the existence of nano-sized loop currents called, `` spin-vortex-induced loop currents (SVILCs)''. We calculate magnetic fields produced by them for a model of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) thin films composed of one surface and two bulk CuO$_2$ bilayers. In this model, bulk CuO$_2$ layers host stable spin-vortices around small polarons formed from doped holes; they give rise to a $U(1)$ gauge field described by the Berry connection from many-body wave functions, and generates the SVILCs. The effect of the gauge field is taken into account by the particle-number conserving Bogoliubov-de Gennes (PNC-BdG) formalism. The magnitude of the calculated magnetic field produced by the SVILCs in the vicinity of the surface ($10a \approx 4$ nm, where $a$ is the lattice constant of the CuO$_2$ plane) is in the order of mT; thus, may be detectable by currently available detection methods. The detection of the SVILCs by the magnetic field measurement may bring about the elucidation of the cuprate superconductivity, and may also lead to their quantum device applications, including qubits.</description>

      <title>NbTi: a nontrivial puzzle for the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of the superconducting state of NbTi, traditionally considered the main workhorse for many large-scale superconducting applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, this compound represents a major challenge for current computational standards in superconductivity. Using the newly developed SSCHA-MLIP framework, we demonstrate that anharmonic effects are required to obtain stable phonon dispersions for the ordered bcc phase, which is unstable at the harmonic level. We also find that treating the residual Coulomb interaction in the newly-developed Kukkonen-Overhauser scheme reduces the $T_c$ by more than 20 $\%$ compared to the simple Morel-Anderson approximation. We show that the unusually large residual discrepancy in $T_c$ with respect to experiment should be attributed to lattice disorder, which we treat with a simple model of Boltzmann-averaged supercells. Our results indicate that a quantitative description of technologically-relevant transition metal alloy superconductors requires methodological developments to account for lattice disorder that go beyond the current standards in computational superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Discovery of superconductivity in technetium-borides at moderate pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in theoretical calculations boosted the searches for high temperature superconductors, such as sulfur hydrides and rare-earth polyhydrides. However, the required extremely high pressures for stabilizing these superconductors handicapped further implementations. Based upon thorough structural searches, we identified series of unprecedented superconducting technetium-borides at moderate pressures, including TcB (P6$_3$/mmc) with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\text{c}}$ = 20.2 K at ambient pressure and TcB$_2$ (P6/mmm) with $T_{\text{c}}$ = 23.1 K at 20 GPa. Superconductivity in these technetium-borides mainly originates from the coupling between the low frequency vibrations of technetium-atoms and the dominant technetium-4d electrons at the Fermi level. Our works therefore present a fresh group in the family of superconducting borides, whose diversified crystal structures suggest rich possibilities in discovery of other superconducting transition-metal-borides.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative Schr\"odinger cat qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.</description>

      <title>Large impact of phonon lineshapes on the superconductivity of solid hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phonon anharmonicity plays a crucial role in determining the stability and vibrational properties of high-pressure hydrides. Furthermore, strong anharmonicity can render phonon quasiparticle picture obsolete questioning standard approaches for modeling superconductivity in these material systems. In this work, we show the effects of non-Lorentzian phonon lineshapes on the superconductivity of high-pressure solid hydrogen. We calculate the superconducting critical temperature T$_\mathrm{C}$ \emph{ab initio} considering the full phonon spectral function and show that it overall enhances the T$_\mathrm{C}$ estimate. The anharmonicity-induced phonon softening exhibited in spectral functions increases the estimate of the critical temperature, while the broadening of phonon lines due to phonon-phonon interaction decreases it. Our calculations also reveal that superconductivity emerges in hydrogen in the $Cmca-12$ molecular phase VI at pressures between 450 and 500 GPa and explain the disagreement between the previous theoretical results and experiments.</description>

      <title>Josephson current flowing through a nontrivial geometry: The role of pairing fluctuations across the BCS-BEC crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A realistic description of the Josephson effect at finite temperature with ultra-cold Fermi gases embedded in nontrivial geometrical constraints (typically, a trap plus a barrier) requires appropriate consideration of pairing fluctuations that arise in inhomogeneous environments. Here, we apply the theoretical approach developed in the companion article [Pisani \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 108}, 214503 (2023)], where the inclusion of pairing fluctuations beyond mean field across the BCS-BEC crossover at finite temperature is combined with a detailed description of the gap parameter in a nontrivial geometry. In this way, we are able to account for the experimental results on the Josephson critical current, reported both at low temperature for various couplings across the BCS-BEC crossover and as a function of temperature at unitarity. Besides validating the theoretical approach of the companion article, our numerical results reveal generic features of the Josephson effect which may not readily emerge from an analysis of corresponding experiments with condensed-matter samples owing to the unique intrinsic flexibility of experiments with ultra-cold gases.</description>

      <title>Inclusion of pairing fluctuations in the differential equation for the gap parameter for superfluid fermions in the presence of nontrivial spatial constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most theoretical treatments of inhomogeneous superconductivity/fermionic superfluidity have been based on the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations (or, else, on their various simplified forms), which implement a standard mean-field decoupling in the presence of spatial inhomogeneities. This approach is reliable even at finite temperature for weak inter-particle attraction, when the Cooper pair size is much larger than the average inter-particle distance (corresponding to the BCS limit of the BCS-BEC crossover). However, it looses accuracy for increasing attraction when the Cooper pair size becomes comparable or even smaller than the average inter-particle distance (corresponding to the BEC limit of the BCS-BEC crossover), in particular when finite-temperature effects are considered. In these cases, inclusion of pairing fluctuations beyond mean field is required, a task that turns out to be especially difficult in the presence of inhomogeneities. Here, we implement the inclusion of pairing fluctuations directly on a coarse-graining version of the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations, which makes it simpler and faster to obtain a solution over the whole sector of the temperature-coupling phase diagram of the BCS-BEC crossover in the broken-symmetry phase. We apply this method in the presence of a super-current flow, such that problems related to the Josephson effect throughout the BCS-BEC crossover can be addressed under a variety of circumstances. This is relevant in the view of recent experimental data with ultra-cold Fermi atoms, to which the results of the present approach favorably compare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in the pressurized trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate, we explore its structural, electronic, and magnetic properties as a function of hydrostatic pressure from first-principles calculations. We find that in both the bilayer and trilayer nickelates, an orthorhombic(monoclinic)-to-tetragonal transition under pressure takes place concomitantly with the onset of superconductivity. The electronic structure of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ can be understood using a molecular trimer basis wherein $n$ molecular subbands arise as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals hybridize strongly along the $c$-axis within the trilayer. The magnetic tendencies indicate that the ground state at ambient pressure is formed by nonmagnetic inner planes and stripe-ordered outer planes that are antiferromagnetically coupled along the $c$ axis, resulting in an unusual $\uparrow$, 0, $\downarrow$ stacking that is consistent with the spin density wave model suggested by neutron diffraction. Such a state is destabilized by the pressures wherein superconductivity arises. Despite the presence of $d_{z^2}$ states at the Fermi level, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals also play a key role in the electronic structure of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. This active role of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states in the low-energy physics of the trilayer RP nickelate, together with the distinct electronic behavior of inner and outer planes, resembles the physics of multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An indispensable ingredient for pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity is the presence of an attractive pairing interaction at finite momentum. Here, we show how this condition can be met with straightforward electron-density interactions in multiband systems. The electron-density interaction, when projected to the band basis, acquires form factors with nontrivial momentum dependence and thereby exhibits a potential tendency to a finite-momentum pairing instability. By applying a mean-field analysis to two simple multiband models, the checkerboard lattice and three-band Hubbard model, we find that PDW order can indeed become the leading instability if a strong nearest-neighbour attraction is present. Moreover, the condition for the transition from a uniform superconductor to a PDW superconductor is shown via a simple quantum geometric argument.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and magnetic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure: active role of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent report of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under pressure, we present an analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ as a function of pressure using correlated density functional theory methods (DFT+$U$). At the bare DFT level, the electronic structure of the ambient and high-pressure phases of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$are qualitatively similar. Upon including local correlation effects within DFT+$U$ and allowing for magnetic ordering, we find a delicate interplay between pressure and electronic correlations. Within the pressure-correlations phase space, we identify a region (at $U$ values consistent with constrained RPA) characterized by a high spin to low spin transition with increasing pressure. In contrast to previous theoretical work that only highlights the crucial role of the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ orbitals in this material, we find that the Ni-$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals are active upon pressure and drive this rich magnetic landscape. This picture is preserved in the presence of oxygen deficiencies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of transport current on the superconducting order parameter in superconducting islands in full-shell epitaxial Al-InAs nanowires. Depending on a device layout, the suppression of superconductivity occurs in three fundamentally different ways -- by a critical current in the case of superconducting reservoirs and by a critical voltage or by a critical Joule power in the case of normal reservoirs. In the latter case, the collapse of the superconducting state depends on the ratio of the dwell time and the electron-phonon relaxation time of quasiparticles in the island. For low resistive and high resistive coupling to the reservoirs, respectively, the relaxation-free regime and the strong electron-phonon relaxation regime are realized. Our results shed light on potential shortcomings of finite-bias transport spectroscopy in floating islands.</description>
