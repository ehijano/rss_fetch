      <title>Mobility and Mobility Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether mobility measures appropriately represent changes in individual status, like income or ranks. We suggest three elementary principles for mobility comparisons and show that many commonly used indices violate one or more of them. These principles are used to characterise two classes of measures that have a natural interpretation in terms of distributional analysis. Class-1 measures are based on the summation of power functions of individual status levels and have connections with generalised-entropy and Kolm inequality measures. Class-2 measures are based on the weighted aggregation of individual status changes and have connections with (extended) Gini inequality measures.</description>

      <title>Mass Shootings, Community Mobility, and the Relocation of Economic Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using foot traffic data for over 150,000 points of interest (POIs) near the sites of 42 mass shootings (2018-2022, U.S.), we evaluate the spatial-temporal impact of the tragic events on community mobility and relocation of economic activities. Visits to nearby POIs decrease, while farther away POIs experience increased foot traffic, implying that communities shift their activities away from the shooting sites. The impact is stronger when stronger trauma responses are expected. Our results suggest that mass shootings drive significant displacements of economic activities and can consequently lead to welfare losses due to distortions in optimal choices of time and location.</description>

      <title>Efficient mid-term forecasting of hourly electricity load using generalized additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate mid-term (weeks to one year) hourly electricity load forecasts are essential for strategic decision-making in power plant operation, ensuring supply security and grid stability, planning and building energy storage systems, and energy trading. While numerous models effectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term forecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, capturing the multifaceted characteristics of load, including daily, weekly and annual seasonal patterns, as well as autoregressive effects, weather and holiday impacts, and socio-economic non-stationarities, presents significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) built from interpretable P-splines that is enhanced with autoregressive post-processing. This model incorporates smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal (ETS) modeled and persistently forecasted non-stationary socio-economic states, a nuanced representation of effects from vacation periods, fixed date and weekday holidays, and seasonal information as inputs. The proposed model is evaluated using load data from 24 European countries over more than 9 years (2015-2024). This analysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers valuable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted load, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead Transmission System Operator (TSO) forecasts, with computation times of just a few seconds for several years of hourly data, underscores the potential of the model for practical application in the power system industry.</description>
