      <title>Interpretable Classification of Levantine Ceramic Thin Sections via Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification of ceramic thin sections is fundamental for understanding ancient pottery production techniques, provenance, and trade networks. Although effective, traditional petrographic analysis is time-consuming. This study explores the application of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), as complementary tools to support the classification of Levantine ceramics based on their petrographic fabrics. A dataset of 1,424 thin section images from 178 ceramic samples belonging to several archaeological sites across the Levantine area, mostly from the Bronze Age, with few samples dating to the Iron Age, was used to train and evaluate these models. The results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves classification performance, with a ResNet18 model achieving 92.11% accuracy and a ViT reaching 88.34%. Explainability techniques, including Guided Grad-CAM and attention maps, were applied to interpret and visualize the models' decisions, revealing that both CNNs and ViTs successfully focus on key mineralogical features for the classification of the samples into their respective petrographic fabrics. These findings highlight the potential of explainable AI in archaeometric studies, providing a reproducible and efficient methodology for ceramic analysis while maintaining transparency in model decision-making.</description>

      <title>A modified Newmark/Newton-Raphson method with automatic differentiation for general nonlinear dynamics analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Newmark/Newton-Raphson (NNR) method is widely employed for solving nonlinear dynamic systems. However, the current NNR method exhibits limited applicability in complex nonlinear dynamic systems, as the acquisition of the Jacobian matrix required for Newton iterations incurs substantial computational costs and may even prove intractable in certain cases. To address these limitations, we integrate automatic differentiation (AD) into the NNR method, proposing a modified NNR method with AD (NNR-AD) to significantly improve its capability for effectively handling complex nonlinear systems. We have demonstrated that the NNR-AD method can directly solve dynamic systems with complex nonlinear characteristics, and its accuracy and generality have been rigorously validated. Furthermore, automatic differentiation significantly simplifies the computation of Jacobian matrices for such complex nonlinear dynamic systems. This improvement endows the NNR method with enhanced modularity, thereby enabling convenient and effective solutions for complex nonlinear dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>An Entropy-Stable/Double-Flux scheme for the multi-component compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel combination of numerical techniques to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of multi-component compressible flow simulations. At the core of our approach is an Entropy-Stable formulation that preserves kinetic energy and integrates a Double-Flux scheme tailored for multi-component flows with variable specific heat ratios. This formulation yields low-dissipation, oscillation-free solutions and enhances stability compared to standard fully conservative methods. To further improve robustness, we introduce a new hybrid dissipation strategy that blends the Entropy-Stable/Double-Flux approach with conventional dissipation mechanisms. We provide a rigorous proof that the resulting numerical flux satisfies a semi-discrete entropy inequality, ensuring consistency with the second law of thermodynamics. For time integration, we employ an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme in combination with adaptive mesh refinement to capture local flow features dynamically. The method is implemented within an existing compressible Navier-Stokes solver based on OpenFOAM. Benchmark cases, including multi-dimensional interface and shock-interface interactions, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results confirm its favorable stability and robustness, validating the approach as a promising advancement for high-fidelity simulations of supersonic flows.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Manifold Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Important material properties like thermal conductivity are often represented as symmetric positive definite (SPD) tensors, which exhibit variability due to inherent material heterogeneity and manufacturing uncertainties. These tensors reside on a curved Riemannian manifold, and accurately modeling their stochastic nature requires preserving both their symmetric positive definite properties and spatial symmetries. To achieve this, uncertainties are parametrized into scaling (magnitude) and rotation (orientation) components, modeled as independent random variables on a manifold structure derived from the maximum entropy principle. The propagation of such stochastic tensors through physics-based simulations necessitates computationally efficient surrogate models. However, traditional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures are not well-suited for SPD tensors, as directly inputting their components fails to preserve their geometric properties, often leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we introduce Constitutive Manifold Neural Networks (CMNN). This approach introduces a preprocessing layer by mapping the SPD tensor from the curved manifold to the local tangent, a flat vector space, creating an information preserving map for input to the hidden layers of the neural networks. A case study on a steady-state heat conduction problem with stochastic anisotropic conductivity demonstrates that geometry-preserving preprocessing, such as logarithmic maps for scaling data, significantly improves learning performance over conventional MLPs. These findings underscore the importance of manifold-aware techniques when working with tensor-valued data in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulation is central to understanding cellular processes and development, potentially leading to the discovery of new treatments for diseases and personalized medicine. Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents significant challenges due to its high dimensionality and complexity. Existing tree-based models, such as GENIE3 and GRNBOOST2, demonstrated scalability and explainability in GRN inference, but they cannot distinguish regulation types nor effectively capture continuous cellular dynamics. In this paper, we introduce scKAN, a novel model that employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) with explainable AI to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq data. By modeling gene expression as differentiable functions matching the smooth nature of cellular dynamics, scKAN can accurately and precisely detect activation and inhibition regulations through explainable AI and geometric tools. We conducted extensive experiments on the BEELINE benchmark, and scKAN surpasses and improves the leading signed GRN inference models ranging from 5.40\% to 28.37\% in AUROC and from 1.97\% to 40.45\% in AUPRC. These results highlight the potential of scKAN in capturing the underlying biological processes in gene regulation without prior knowledge of the graph structure.</description>

      <title>Embedding Trust at Scale: Physics-Aware Neural Watermarking for Secure and Verifiable Data Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a robust neural watermarking framework for scientific data integrity, targeting high-dimensional fields common in climate modeling and fluid simulations. Using a convolutional autoencoder, binary messages are invisibly embedded into structured data such as temperature, vorticity, and geopotential. Our method ensures watermark persistence under lossy transformations - including noise injection, cropping, and compression - while maintaining near-original fidelity (sub-1\% MSE). Compared to classical singular value decomposition (SVD)-based watermarking, our approach achieves $&gt;$98\% bit accuracy and visually indistinguishable reconstructions across ERA5 and Navier-Stokes datasets. This system offers a scalable, model-compatible tool for data provenance, auditability, and traceability in high-performance scientific workflows, and contributes to the broader goal of securing AI systems through verifiable, physics-aware watermarking. We evaluate on physically grounded scientific datasets as a representative stress-test; the framework extends naturally to other structured domains such as satellite imagery and autonomous-vehicle perception streams.</description>

      <title>GUST: Quantifying Free-Form Geometric Uncertainty of Metamaterials Using Small Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces GUST (Generative Uncertainty learning via Self-supervised pretraining and Transfer learning), a framework for quantifying free-form geometric uncertainties inherent in the manufacturing of metamaterials. GUST leverages the representational power of deep generative models to learn a high-dimensional conditional distribution of as-fabricated unit cell geometries given nominal designs, thereby enabling uncertainty quantification. To address the scarcity of real-world manufacturing data, GUST employs a two-stage learning process. First, it leverages self-supervised pretraining on a large-scale synthetic dataset to capture the structure variability inherent in metamaterial geometries and an approximated distribution of as-fabricated geometries given nominal designs. Subsequently, GUST employs transfer learning by fine-tuning the pretrained model on limited real-world manufacturing data, allowing it to adapt to specific manufacturing processes and nominal designs. With only 960 unit cells additively manufactured in only two passes, GUST can capture the variability in geometry and effective material properties. In contrast, directly training a generative model on the same amount of real-world data proves insufficient, as demonstrated through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. This scalable and cost-effective approach significantly reduces data requirements while maintaining the effectiveness in learning complex, real-world geometric uncertainties, offering an affordable method for free-form geometric uncertainty quantification in the manufacturing of metamaterials. The capabilities of GUST hold significant promise for high-precision industries such as aerospace and biomedical engineering, where understanding and mitigating manufacturing uncertainties are critical.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Green AI Architectures for Circular Economies Through Multi-Layered Sustainable Resource Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research paper, we propose a new type of energy-efficient Green AI architecture to support circular economies and address the contemporary challenge of sustainable resource consumption in modern systems. We introduce a multi-layered framework and meta-architecture that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, energy-conscious computational models, and optimization techniques to facilitate decision-making for resource reuse, waste reduction, and sustainable production.We tested the framework on real-world datasets from lithium-ion battery recycling and urban waste management systems, demonstrating its practical applicability. Notably, the key findings of this study indicate a 25 percent reduction in energy consumption during workflows compared to traditional methods and an 18 percent improvement in resource recovery efficiency. Quantitative optimization was based on mathematical models such as mixed-integer linear programming and lifecycle assessments. Moreover, AI algorithms improved classification accuracy on urban waste by 20 percent, while optimized logistics reduced transportation emissions by 30 percent. We present graphical analyses and visualizations of the developed framework, illustrating its impact on energy efficiency and sustainability as reflected in the simulation results. This paper combines the principles of Green AI with practical insights into how such architectural models contribute to circular economies, presenting a fully scalable and scientifically rooted solution aligned with applicable UN Sustainability Goals worldwide. These results open avenues for incorporating newly developed AI technologies into sustainable management strategies, potentially safeguarding local natural capital while advancing technological progress.</description>

      <title>The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</description>

      <title>SimLOB: Learning Representations of Limited Order Book for Financial Market Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19396v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial market simulation (FMS) serves as a promising tool for understanding market anomalies and the underlying trading behaviors. To ensure high-fidelity simulations, it is crucial to calibrate the FMS model for generating data closely resembling the observed market data. Previous efforts primarily focused on calibrating the mid-price data, leading to essential information loss of the market activities and thus biasing the calibrated model. The Limit Order Book (LOB) data is the fundamental data fully capturing the market micro-structure and is adopted by worldwide exchanges. However, LOB is not applicable to existing calibration objective functions due to its tabular structure not suitable for the vectorized input requirement. This paper proposes to explicitly learn the vectorized representations of LOB with a Transformer-based autoencoder. Then the latent vector, which captures the major information of LOB, can be applied for calibration. Extensive experiments show that the learned latent representation not only preserves the non-linear auto-correlation in the temporal axis, but the precedence between successive price levels of LOB. Besides, it is verified that the performance of the representation learning stage is consistent with the downstream calibration tasks. Thus, this work also progresses the FMS on LOB data, for the first time.</description>

      <title>Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17500v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle trajectories are a promising GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data source to compute multi-scale traffic flow maps ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level, large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level, small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.</description>

      <title>Building Interpretable Climate Emulators for Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for developing efficient and interpretable climate emulators (CEs) for economic models of climate change. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we propose a general framework for constructing carbon-cycle emulators (CCEs) for macroeconomic models. The framework is implemented as a generalized linear multi-reservoir (box) model that conserves key physical quantities and can be customized for specific applications. We consider three versions of the CCE, which we evaluate within a simple representative agent economic model: (i) a three-box setting comparable to DICE-2016, (ii) a four-box extension, and (iii) a four-box version that explicitly captures land-use change. While the three-box model reproduces benchmark results well and the fourth reservoir adds little, incorporating the impact of land-use change on the carbon storage capacity of the terrestrial biosphere substantially alters atmospheric carbon stocks, temperature trajectories, and the optimal mitigation path. Second, we investigate pattern-scaling techniques that transform global-mean temperature projections from CEs into spatially heterogeneous warming fields. We show how regional baseline climates, non-uniform warming, and the associated uncertainties propagate into economic damages.</description>

      <title>LOB-Bench: Benchmarking Generative AI for Finance -- an Application to Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While financial data presents one of the most challenging and interesting sequence modelling tasks due to high noise, heavy tails, and strategic interactions, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of consensus on quantitative evaluation paradigms. To address this, we present LOB-Bench, a benchmark, implemented in python, designed to evaluate the quality and realism of generative message-by-order data for limit order books (LOB) in the LOBSTER format. Our framework measures distributional differences in conditional and unconditional statistics between generated and real LOB data, supporting flexible multivariate statistical evaluation. The benchmark also includes features commonly used LOB statistics such as spread, order book volumes, order imbalance, and message inter-arrival times, along with scores from a trained discriminator network. Lastly, LOB-Bench contains "market impact metrics", i.e. the cross-correlations and price response functions for specific events in the data. We benchmark generative autoregressive state-space models, a (C)GAN, as well as a parametric LOB model and find that the autoregressive GenAI approach beats traditional model classes.</description>

      <title>How Much is Enough? The Diminishing Returns of Tokenization Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tokenization, a crucial initial step in natural language processing, is governed by several key parameters, such as the tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, pre-tokenization strategy, inference strategy, and training data corpus. This paper investigates the impact of an often-overlooked hyperparameter, tokenizer training data size. We train BPE, UnigramLM, and WordPiece tokenizers across various vocabulary sizes using English training data ranging from 1GB to 900GB. Our findings reveal diminishing returns as training data size increases beyond roughly 150GB, suggesting a practical limit to the improvements in tokenization quality achievable through additional data. We analyze this phenomenon and attribute the saturation effect to constraints introduced by the pre-tokenization stage. We then demonstrate the extent to which these findings can generalize by experimenting on data in Russian, a language typologically distant from English. For Russian text, we observe diminishing returns after training a tokenizer from 200GB of data, which is approximately 33% more than when training on English. These results provide valuable insights for optimizing the tokenization process by reducing the compute required for training on large corpora and suggest promising directions for future research in tokenization algorithms.</description>

      <title>TL;DR: Too Long, Do Re-weighting for Efficient LLM Reasoning Compression</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and data will be available soon.</description>
