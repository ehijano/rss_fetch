      <title>What Can 240,000 New Credit Transactions Tell Us About the Impact of NGEU Funds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a panel data local projections model and controlling for firm characteristics, procurement bid attributes, and macroeconomic conditions, the study estimates the dynamic effects of procurement awards on new lending, a more precise measure than the change in the stock of credit. The analysis further examines heterogeneity in credit responses based on firm size, industry, credit maturity, and value chain position of the firms. The empirical evidence confirms that public procurement awards significantly increase new lending, with NGEU-funded contracts generating stronger credit expansion than traditional procurement during the recent period. The results show that the impact of NGEU procurement programs aligns closely with historical procurement impacts, with differences driven mainly by lower utilization rates. Moreover, integrating high-frequency financial data with procurement records highlights the potential of Big Data in refining public policy design.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrency Time Series on the Binary Complexity-Entropy Plane: Ranking Efficiency from the Perspective of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first application of a tailored Complexity-Entropy Plane designed for binary sequences and structures. We do so by considering the daily up/down price fluctuations of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization (stable-coins excluded) that are worth $circa \,\, 90 \%$ of the total crypto market capitalization. With that, we focus on the basic elements of price motion that compare with the random walk backbone features associated with mathematical properties of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. From the location of each crypto on the Binary Complexity-Plane (BiCEP) we define an inefficiency score, $\mathcal I$, and rank them accordingly. The results based on the BiCEP analysis, which we substantiate with statistical testing, indicate that only Shiba Inu (SHIB) is significantly inefficient, whereas the largest stake of crypto trading is reckoned to operate in close-to-efficient conditions. Generically, our $\mathcal I$-based ranking hints the design and consensus architecture of a crypto is at least as relevant to efficiency as the features that are usually taken into account in the appraisal of the efficiency of financial instruments, namely canonical fiat money. Lastly, this set of results supports the validity of the binary complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Multivariate Regularized Distributional Regression for High-dimensional Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic electricity price forecasting (PEPF) is a key task for market participants in short-term electricity markets. The increasing availability of high-frequency data and the need for real-time decision-making in energy markets require online estimation methods for efficient model updating. We present an online, multivariate, regularized distributional regression model, allowing for the modeling of all distribution parameters conditional on explanatory variables. Our approach is based on the combination of the multivariate distributional regression and an efficient online learning algorithm based on online coordinate descent for LASSO-type regularization. Additionally, we propose to regularize the estimation along a path of increasingly complex dependence structures of the multivariate distribution, allowing for parsimonious estimation and early stopping. We validate our approach through one of the first forecasting studies focusing on multivariate probabilistic forecasting in the German day-ahead electricity market while using only online estimation methods. We compare our approach to online LASSO-ARX-models with adaptive marginal distribution and to online univariate distributional models combined with an adaptive Copula. We show that the multivariate distributional regression, which allows modeling all distribution parameters - including the mean and the dependence structure - conditional on explanatory variables such as renewable in-feed or past prices provide superior forecasting performance compared to modeling of the marginals only and keeping a static/unconditional dependence structure. Additionally, online estimation yields a speed-up by a factor of 80 to over 400 times compared to batch fitting.</description>
