      <title>Maximization and minimization of the principal eigenvalue of the Laplacian with indefinite weight under Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions on classes of rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 1$, be a bounded connected open set. We consider the weighted eigenvalue problem $-\Delta u =\lambda m u$ in $\Omega$ with $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $m\in L^\infty(\Omega)$ and with homogeneous Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. First, we study weak* continuity, convexity and G\^ateaux differentiability of the map $m\mapsto1/\lambda_1(m)$, where $\lambda_1(m)$ is the principal eigenvalue. Then, denoting by $\mathcal{G}(m_0)$ the class of rearrangements of a fixed weight $m_0$ and assuming that $m_0$ is positive on a set of positive Lebesgue measure, we investigate the minimization and maximization of $\lambda_1(m)$ over $\mathcal{G}(m_0)$. The minimization problem has been already discussed in some papers; here we prove some known results about the existence and characterization of minimizers of $\lambda_1(m)$. We underline that our approach allows us to treat Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions together. Instead, to our best knowledge, the maximization problem has been only partially addressed in the literature. It turns out that the maximization of $\lambda_1(m)$ is more intricate than its minimization. In our work we discuss existence, uniqueness and characterization of maximizers both in $ \mathcal{G}(m_0)$ and in its weak* closure $\overline{\mathcal{G}(m_0)}$. In particular, we provide an original full description of the unique maximizer in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the context of the population dynamics, this kind of problems arise from the question of determining the optimal spatial location of favourable and unfavourable habitats in order to increase the chances of survival or extinction of a population.</description>

      <title>RG approach to the inviscid limit for shell models of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an initial value problem for shell models that mimic turbulent velocity fluctuations over a geometric sequence of scales. Our goal is to study the convergence of solutions in the inviscid (more generally, vanishing regularization) limit and explain the universality of both the limiting solutions and the convergence process. We develop a renormalization group (RG) formalism representing this limit as dynamics in a space of flow maps. For the dyadic shell model, the RG dynamics has a fixed-point attractor, which determines universal limiting solutions. Deviations from the limiting solutions are also universal and given by a leading eigenmode (eigenvalue and eigenvector) of the linearized RG operator. Application to the Gledzer and Sabra shell models reveal the respective quasiperiodic and chaotic RG dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fractional Orlicz boundary Hardy-type inequality for bounded Lipschitz domains. Further, we establish fractional Orlicz boundary Hardy-type inequalities with logarithmic corrections for specific critical cases across various domains, such as bounded Lipschitz domains, domains above the graph of a Lipschitz function, and the complement of a bounded Lipschitz domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we consider anisotropic degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations and degenerate quasilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We prove the equivalence of two notions of entropy and viscosity solutions of two equations, and apply it to obtain a large-time behavior of viscosity solutions to quasilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and entropy solutions to degenerate parabolic-hyperbolic equations in a periodic setting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the three-dimensional isentropic compressible Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system with density-dependent viscosities. When the initial density is linearly equivalent to a large constant state, we prove that strong solutions exist globally in time, and there is no restriction on the size of the initial velocity and initial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear parabolic equations with superlinear nonlinearities in critical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-posedness in time-weighted spaces for quasilinear (and semilinear) parabolic evolution equations $u'=A(u)u+f(u)$ is established in a certain critical case of strict inclusion $\mathrm{dom}(f)\subsetneq \mathrm{dom}(A)$ for the domains of the (superlinear) function $u\mapsto f(u)$ and the quasilinear part $u\mapsto A(u)$. Based upon regularizing effects of parabolic equations, it is proven that the solution map generates a semiflow in a critical intermediate space. The applicability of the abstract results is demonstrated by several examples including a model for atmospheric flows and semilinear and quasilinear evolution equations with scaling invariance for which well-posedness in the critical scaling invariant intermediate spaces is shown.</description>

      <title>Estimates of the gaps between consecutive eigenvalues for a class of elliptic differential operators in divergence form on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain estimates for the upper bound of gaps between consecutive eigenvalues for the eigenvalue problem of a class of second-order elliptic differential operators in divergent form, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, in a limited domain of n-dimensional Euclidean space. This class of operators includes the well-known Laplacian and the square Cheng-Yau operator. For the Laplacian case, our estimate coincides with that obtained by D. Chen, T. Zheng, and H. Yang, which is the best possible in terms of the order of the eigenvalues. For pinched Cartan-Hadamard manifolds the estimates were made in particular cases of this operator.</description>

      <title>An inverse problem for fractional random walks on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inverse problem on a finite connected graph $G = (X, E)$, on whose vertices a conductivity $\gamma$ is defined. Our data consists in a sequence of partial observations of a fractional random walk on $G$. The observations are partial in the sense that they are limited to a fixed, observable subset $B \subseteq X$, while the random walk is fractional in the sense that it allows long jumps with a probability $P$ decreasing as a fractional power of the distance along the graph. The transition probability $P$ also depends on $\gamma$. We show that this kind of random walk data allows for the reconstruction of the amount of vertices $\|X\|$, the edge set $E$ and the conductivity $\gamma$ up to natural constraints, which we discuss. We also show a characterization of the random walk data in terms of the corresponding transition matrices $P$ , which highlights a new surprising nonlocal property. This work is motivated by the recent strong interest in the study of the fractional Calder\'on problem in the Riemannian setting.</description>

      <title>Energy conservation for weak solutions of incompressible Newtonian fluid equations in H\"older spaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sufficient H\"older continuity conditions on Leray-Hopf (weak) solutions to the in unsteady Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions guaranteeing energy conservation. Our focus is on the half-space case with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. This problem is more technically challenging, if compared to the Cauchy or periodic cases, and has not been previously addressed. At present are known a few sub-optimal results obtained through Morrey embedding results based on conditions for the gradient of the velocity in Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the results in this paper are obtained without any additional assumption neither on the pressure nor the flux of the velocity, near to the boundary.</description>

      <title>Global Existence of Large Strong Solutions to the 3D Full Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Density-dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to investigate the Cauchy problem of global in time existence of large strong solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous compressible and heat conducting fluids. A class of density-dependent viscosity is considered. By introducing the modified effective viscous flux and using the bootstrap argument, we establish the global existence of large strong solutions when the initial density is linearly equivalent to a large constant state. It should be mentioned that this result is obtained without any restrictions on the size of initial velocity and initial temperature.</description>

      <title>Inverse Iteration for the Laplace Eigenvalue Problem with Robin and Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the method of inverse iteration to the Laplace eigenvalue problem with Robin and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, respectively. For each problem, we prove convergence of the iterates to a non-trivial principal eigenfunction and show that the corresponding Rayleigh quotients converge to the principal eigenvalue. We also propose a related iterative method for an eigenvalue problem arising from a model for optimal insulation and provide some partial results.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates in the nonrelativistic limit of the cubic Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonrelativistic limit of the cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with a small parameter $0&lt;\varepsilon \ll 1$, which is inversely proportional to the speed of light. We show that the cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation converges to the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a convergence rate of order $\varepsilon^{2}$. In particular, for the defocusing case and smooth initial data, we prove error estimates of the form $(1+t)\varepsilon^{2}$ at time $t$ which is valid up to long time of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$; while for nonsmooth initial data, we prove error estimates of the form $(1+t)\varepsilon$ at time $t$ which is valid up to long time of order $\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. These specific forms of error estimates coincide with the numerical results obtained in \cite{BZ19,SZ20}.</description>

      <title>Rectifiability, finite Hausdorff measure, and compactness for non-minimizing Bernoulli free boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there are numerous results on minimizers or stable solutions of the Bernoulli problem proving regularity of the free boundary and analyzing singularities, much less in known about critical points of the corresponding energy. Saddle points of the energy (or of closely related energies) and solutions of the corresponding time-dependent problem occur naturally in applied problems such as water waves and combustion theory.
  For such critical points $u$ -- which can be obtained as limits of classical solutions or limits of a singular perturbation problem -- it has been open since [Weiss03] whether the singular set can be large and what equation the measure $\Delta u$ satisfies, except for the case of two dimensions. In the present result we use recent techniques such as a frequency formula for the Bernoulli problem as well as the celebrated Naber-Valtorta procedure to answer this more than 20 year old question in an affirmative way:
  For a closed class we call variational solutions of the Bernoulli problem, we show that the topological free boundary $\partial \{u &gt; 0\}$ (including degenerate singular points $x$, at which $u(x + r \cdot)/r \rightarrow 0$ as $r\rightarrow 0$) is countably $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$-rectifiable and has locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}$-measure, and we identify the measure $\Delta u$ completely. This gives a more precise characterization of the free boundary of $u$ in arbitrary dimension than was previously available even in dimension two.
  We also show that limits of (not necessarily minimizing) classical solutions as well as limits of critical points of a singularly perturbed energy are variational solutions, so that the result above applies directly to all of them.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Cahn-Hilliard type systems driven by nonlocal integrodifferential operators with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a fractional variant of the Cahn-Hilliard equation settled in a bounded domain and with a possibly singular potential. We first focus on the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and show how to prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution. The proof relies on the variational method known as \textit{minimizing-movements scheme}, which fits naturally with the gradient-flow structure of the equation. The interest of the proposed method lies in its extreme generality and flexibility. In particular, relying on the variational structure of the equation, we prove the existence of a solution for a general class of integrodifferential operators, not necessarily linear or symmetric, which include fractional versions of the $q$-Laplacian. In the second part of the paper, we adapt the argument in order to prove the existence of solutions in the case of regional fractional operators. As a byproduct, this yields an existence result in the interesting cases of homogeneous fractional Neumann boundary conditions or periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove existence of weak solutions to a diffuse interface model describing the flow of a fluid through a deformable porous medium consisting of two phases. The system non-linearly couples Biot's equations for poroelasticity, including phase-field dependent material properties, with the Cahn-Hilliard equation to model the evolution of the solid, and is further augmented by a visco-elastic regularization of Kelvin-Viogt type. To obtain this result, we approximate the problem in two steps, where first a semi-Galerkin ansatz is employed to show existence of weak solutions to regularized systems, for which later on compactness arguments allow limit passage. Notably, we also establish a maximal regularity theory for linear visco-elastic problems.</description>

      <title>Limiting absorption principle and absence of eigenvalues for massless Klein-Gordon operators on perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a uniform weighted resolvent estimate for the massless Klein-Gordon operator on a curved spacetime which is sufficiently close to the Minkowski spacetime. This particularly implies the existence and H\"{o}lder continuity of the limiting resolvents at all energies, as well as the absolute continuity, of the massless Klein-Gordon operator. The proof is based on a simple version of Mourre's commutator method and does not rely on microlocal analysis. We also prove the absence of eigenvalues via the Virial theorem under an ellipticity condition on the commutator of the massless Klein-Gordon operator against the generator of a wick-rotated dilation, which is weaker than the smallness condition for the metric perturbation.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for a class of stochastic partial differential equations by adding a suitable nonlinear noise, while the corresponding deterministic equations may only have local solutions. In particular, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system.
  Furthermore, our main results have broad applications, including not only all locally monotone stochastic equations in the variational framework (cf. \cite{LR2,LR1,RSZ1}), but also several new models such as stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations and stochastic surface growth models, which provide positive answers to some longstanding open problems in this field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a new weak formulation that ensures well-posedness for a broad range of stochastic partial differential equations with pseudo-differential operators whose symbols depend only on time and spatial frequencies. The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on the symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that the stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak sense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity and ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include many interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or integrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need to be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.</description>
