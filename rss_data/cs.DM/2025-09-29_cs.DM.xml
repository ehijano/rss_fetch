      <title>Semi-Random Graphs, Robust Asymmetry, and Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Graph Reconstruction Conjecture famously posits that any undirected graph on at least three vertices is determined up to isomorphism by its family of (unlabeled) induced subgraphs. At present, the conjecture admits partial resolutions of two types: 1) casework-based demonstrations of reconstructibility for families of graphs satisfying certain structural properties, and 2) probabilistic arguments establishing reconstructibility of random graphs by leveraging average-case phenomena. While results in the first category capture the worst-case nature of the conjecture, they play a limited role in understanding the general case. Results in the second category address much larger graph families, but it remains unclear how heavily the necessary arguments rely on optimistic distributional properties. Drawing on the perspectives of smoothed and semi-random analysis, we study the robustness of what are arguably the two most fundamental properties in this latter line of work: asymmetry and uniqueness of subgraphs. Notably, we find that various semi-random graph distributions exhibit these properties asymptotically, much like their Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi counterparts.
  In particular, Bollob\'as (1990) demonstrated that almost all Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G = (V, E) \sim \mathscr{G}(n, p)$ enjoy the property that their induced subgraphs on $n - \Theta(1)$ vertices are asymmetric and mutually non-isomorphic, for $1 - p, p = \Omega(\log(n) / n)$. We show that this property is robust against perturbation -- even when an adversary is permitted to add/remove each vertex pair in $V^{(2)}$ with (independent) arbitrarily large constant probability. Exploiting this result, we derive asymptotic characterizations of asymmetry in random graphs with planted structure and bounded adversarial corruptions, along with improved bounds on the probability mass of nonreconstructible graphs in $\mathscr{G}(n, p)$.</description>

      <title>List coloring ordered graphs with forbidden induced subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the List $k$-Coloring problem we are given a graph whose every vertex is equipped with a list, which is a subset of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$. We need to decide if $G$ admits a proper coloring, where every vertex receives a color from its list.
  The complexity of the problem in classes defined by forbidding induced subgraphs is a widely studied topic in algorithmic graph theory. Recently, Hajebi, Li, and Spirkl [SIAM J. Discr. Math. 38 (2024)] initiated the study of List $3$-Coloring in ordered graphs, i.e., graphs with fixed linear ordering of vertices. Forbidding ordered induced subgraphs allows us to investigate the boundary of tractability more closely.
  We continue this direction of research, focusing mostly on the case of List $4$-Coloring. We present several algorithmic and hardness results, which altogether provide an almost complete dichotomy for classes defined by forbidding one fixed ordered graph: our investigations leave one minimal open case.</description>

      <title>New constructions of free products and geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method for constructing new presentations of free products that give rise to previously unknown geodetic Cayley graphs. Our approach adapts subdivision techniques of Parthasarathy and Srinivasan [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 1982], which preserve geodecity at the graph level, to the setting of group presentations and rewriting systems. Specifically, given a group $G$ with geodetic Cayley graph with respect to generating set $\Sigma$ and an integer $n$, our construction produces a rewriting system presenting $G \ast F_{n|\Sigma|}$ with geodetic Cayley graph with respect to the new generating set. This framework provides new infinite families of geodetic Cayley graphs and extends the toolkit for investigating long-standing conjectures on geodetic groups.</description>

      <title>Neural Feature Geometry Evolves as Discrete Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000 feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting network depth.</description>

      <title>Computation of Graph Polynomials via Tree Decomposition: Theory, Algorithms, and Python Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph polynomials encode fundamental combinatorial invariants of graphs. Their computation is investigated using tree and path decomposition frameworks, with formal definitions of treewidth, k-trees, and pathwidth establishing the structural basis for algorithmic efficiency. Explicit algorithms are constructed for each polynomial, leveraging decomposition order and state transformation mappings to enable tractable computation on graphs of bounded treewidth. Python implementations validate the methods, and computational complexity is analyzed with respect to sparse and k-degenerate graph classes. These results advance decomposition-based approaches for polynomial computation in algebraic graph theory.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Powers of Certain Classes of Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of graph powers has been extensively studied in graph theory. Analogous to graph powers, Chandran et al. [3] introduced the notion of bipartite powers for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we show that the class of interval bigraphs, as well as the class of proper interval bigraphs are closed under the operation of taking bipartite powers. Finally, we define strongly closed property for bipartite graphs under powers and have shown that the class of chordal bipartite graphs is strongly closed under bipartite powers.</description>
