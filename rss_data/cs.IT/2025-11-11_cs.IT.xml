      <title>Joint Space Time Coding on RIS for Simultaneous Direct Modulation and Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-based direct modulation communication systems have garnered significant attention due to their low cost, low power consumption, and baseband-less characteristics. However, these systems face challenges such as the random time-varying coding state of the RIS and the difficulty in implementing beamforming in direct modulation. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective joint space-time coding approach for RIS that enables simultaneous realization of both direct modulation communication and beamforming. By modeling the transmitted signals of the RIS using space-time coding, we show that the time coding determines the direct modulation functionality, while the space coding governs the beamforming. Consequently, we introduce a joint time-space coding technique by performing exclusive-or (XOR) operations on the time and space coding sequences, enabling both functionalities to be achieved concurrently. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we design and fabricate a transmissive 1-bit phase reconfigurable RIS operating in the 3.4~3.79 GHz frequency band for the implementation of a direct modulation communication system. Experimental results reveal that the bit error rate (BER) is significantly reduced when joint space-time coding is used, compared to using time coding alone. Additionally, the root-mean-square error vector magnitude (rmsEVM) of the constellation diagram is reduced by 55%. This technique is promising for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), contributing to the development of intelligent networks for electronic devices.</description>

      <title>CommUNext: Deep Learning-Based Cross-Band and Multi-Directional Signal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are envisioned to achieve full-band cognition by jointly utilizing spectrum resources from Frequency Range~1 (FR1) to Frequency Range~3 (FR3, 7--24\,GHz). Realizing this vision faces two challenges. First, physics-based ray tracing (RT), the standard tool for network planning and coverage modeling, becomes computationally prohibitive for multi-band and multi-directional analysis over large areas. Second, current 5G systems rely on inter-frequency measurement gaps for carrier aggregation and beam management, which reduce throughput, increase latency, and scale poorly as bands and beams proliferate. These limitations motivate a data-driven approach to infer high-frequency characteristics from low-frequency observations. This work proposes CommUNext, a unified deep learning framework for cross-band, multi-directional signal strength (SS) prediction. The framework leverages low-frequency coverage data and crowd-aided partial measurements at the target band to generate high-fidelity FR3 predictions. Two complementary architectures are introduced: Full CommUNext, which substitutes costly RT simulations for large-scale offline modeling, and Partial CommUNext, which reconstructs incomplete low-frequency maps to mitigate measurement gaps in real-time operation. Experimental results show that CommUNext delivers accurate and robust high-frequency SS prediction even with sparse supervision, substantially reducing both simulation and measurement overhead.</description>

      <title>L2T-Hyena: Enhancing State-Space Models with an Adaptive Learn-to-Teach Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05926v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to computationally intensive architectures like Transformers, particularly for sequence modeling. However, a fundamental challenge in their training is the reliance on static loss functions, which may not be optimal across all learning stages. To address this issue, in this paper a hybrid model integrating the Hyena architecture with a Dynamic Loss Network (DLN) is proposed which is guided by a Learn-to-Teach (L2T) approach (L2T-DLN). In this framework, the Hyena model is a student, and its loss function is optimized adaptively. A teacher model, leveraging a memory of the student's past performance, guides the DLN in dynamically balancing the primary cross-entropy loss and a regularization term. Experiments on the Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset show that our approach significantly improves language modeling performance. Our proposed model achieved a validation Perplexity of 102.6, a notable improvement over the 110.4 achieved by a baseline Hyena model using a static loss function. This research indicates that combining SSMs with adaptive loss function markedly enhances the quality and efficiency of deep learning models for sequential data, showing potential for applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP), time-series analysis, and biological signal processing.</description>

      <title>Average AoI in Pinching Antenna-assisted WPCNs with Probabilistic LoS Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the age of information (AoI) for a pinching antenna (PA)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. AoI is a key metric for evaluating the freshness of status updates in IoT networks, and its optimization is crucial for ensuring the performance of time-critical applications. To facilitate analysis and gain useful insights, we consider a representative scenario, where an IoT device harvests energy from a base station (BS) equipped with a PA and transmits data packets to it. The IoT device harvests energy via the PA until its capacitor is fully charged, then transmits status updates using all stored energy. We derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI by analyzing the capacitor charging time, transmission success probability, and inter-arrival time of successful updates. To minimize the average AoI, we formulate an optimization problem of PA position, and propose a one-dimensional search to solve it. The simulation results show that the optimal PA position is the one closest to the IoT device, and this conclusion can be extended to the multi-IoT devices frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scenario. The PA-based systems significantly outperform the conventional fixed-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Adversarial Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06003v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index of the desired message secret from the servers. PIR schemes have been extended to various scenarios with adversarial servers: PIR schemes where some servers are unresponsive or return noisy responses are called robust PIR and Byzantine PIR, respectively; PIR schemes where some servers collude to reveal the index are called colluding PIR. The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies. However, systematic ways to construct PIR schemes that achieve the upper bound are not known. In order to construct a capacity-achieving PIR schemes systematically, it is necessary to clarify the conditions that the queries should satisfy. This paper proves the necessary and sufficient conditions for capacity-achieving PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>Capacity Analysis of Cascaded BD-RIS Assisted MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the cascaded deployment of beyond diagonal (BD) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and explores its potential to enhance the performance of MIMO systems. We first derive the jointly optimal closed form solutions for the RISs in cascade with SVD water filling (SVD WF) and uniform power allocation (UPA) precoding strategies. The optimally configured cascaded-RIS with UPA is shown to achieve performance comparable to that with the SVD WF approach, suggesting that cascaded-RISs can also aid in reducing transmitter complexity. Furthermore, the approximate ergodic capacity for UPA is derived, along with its high SNR approximation which provides multiple useful insights into the dimension and deployment of cascaded RISs. The analytical results establish a clear tradeoff among transmit power, RIS size, and achievable capacity, providing insights for practical deployment in high SNR cascaded RIS MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Constellation Design for Digital Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) has emerged as a key technique for efficient function computation over multiple-access channels (MACs) by exploiting the waveform superposition property of the wireless domain. While conventional OAC methods rely on analog amplitude modulation, their performance is often limited by noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, motivating the use of digital modulation schemes. This paper proposes a novel digital modulation framework optimized for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The design is formulated as an additive mapping problem to determine the optimal constellation that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) under a transmit power constraint. We express the optimal constellation design as a system of nonlinear equations and establish the conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness of its solution. In the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal modulation parameters using the generalized Lambert function, providing analytical insight into the system's behavior. Furthermore, we discuss extensions of the framework to higher-dimensional grids corresponding to multiple channel uses, to non-Gaussian noise models, and to computation over real-valued domains via hybrid digital-analog modulation.</description>

      <title>Differential Space-Time Block Coding for Phase-Unsynchronized Cell-Free MIMO Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the downlink of a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system, spectral efficiency gains critically rely on joint coherent transmission, as all access points (APs) must align their transmitted signals in phase at the user equipment (UE). Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.</description>

      <title>Events Meet Phase-Shifting Digital Holography: Practical Acquisition, Theory, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel phase-shifting digital holography (PSDH) method leveraging a hybrid event-based vision sensor (EVS). The key idea of our method is the phase shift during a single exposure. The hybrid EVS records a hologram blurred by the phase shift, together with the events corresponding to blur variations. We present analytical and optimization-based methods that theoretically support the reconstruction of full-complex wavefronts from the blurred hologram and events. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a reconstruction quality comparable to that of a conventional PSDH method while enhancing the acquisition efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Inaccessible Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the inaccessible game, an information-theoretic dynamical system constructed from four axioms. The first three axioms are known and define \emph{information loss} in the system. The fourth is a novel \emph{information isolation} axiom that assumes our system is isolated from observation, making it observer-independent and exchangeable. Under this isolation axiom, total marginal entropy is conserved: $\sum_i h_i = C$. We consider maximum entropy production in the game and show that the dynamics exhibit a GENERIC-like structure combining reversible and irreversible components.</description>

      <title>Code Equivalence, Point Set Equivalence, and Polynomial Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear code equivalence (LCE) problem is shown to be equivalent to the point set equivalence (PSE) problem, i.e., the problem to check whether two sets of points in a projective space over a finite field differ by a linear change of coordinates. For such a point set $\mathbb{X}$, let $R$ be its homogeneous coordinate ring and $\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$ its canonical ideal. Then the LCE problem is shown to be equivalent to an algebra isomorphism problem for the doubling $R/\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$. As this doubling is an Artinian Gorenstein algebra, we can use its Macaulay inverse system to reduce the LCE problem to a Polynomial Isomorphism (PI) problem for homogeneous polynomials. The last step is polynomial time under some mild assumptions about the codes. Moreover, for indecomposable iso-dual codes we can reduce the LCE search problem to the PI search problem of degree 3 by noting that the corresponding point sets are self-associated and arithmetically Gorenstein, so that we can use the isomorphism problem for the Artinian reductions of the coordinate rings and form their Macaulay inverse systems.</description>

      <title>Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes Under an Extended Delay Profile for Three-Node Relay Networks With Burst Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates streaming codes for three-node relay networks under burst packet erasures with a delay constraint $T$. In any sliding window of $T+1$ consecutive packets, the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels may introduce burst erasures of lengths at most $b_1$ and $b_2$, respectively. Let $u = \max\{b_1, b_2\}$ and $v = \min\{b_1, b_2\}$. Singhvi et al. proposed a construction achieving the optimal rate when $u\mid (T-u-v)$. In this paper, we present an extended delay profile method that attains the optimal rate under a relaxed constraint $\frac{T - u - v}{2u - v} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{T - u - v}{u} \right\rfloor$ and it strictly cover restriction $u\mid (T-u-v)$. %Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal rate for streaming codes is not achievable when $0&lt; T-u-v&lt;v$ under the convolutional code framework.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Reflective Near-Field Beamfocusing using a b-bit RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first experimental validation of reflective near-field beamfocusing using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). While beamfocusing has been theoretically established as a key feature of large-aperture RISs, its practical realization has remained unexplored. We derive new analytical expressions for the array gain achieved with a $b$-bit RIS in near-field line-of-sight scenarios, characterizing both the finite depth and angular width of the focal region. The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that near-field beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation. These findings demonstrate that near-field beamfocusing is a robust and practically viable feature of RIS-assisted wireless communications.</description>

      <title>A Copula-based Semantics-Structure Minimization Framework for QoS Guaranteed Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current empirically driven research on semantic communication lacks a unified theoretical foundation, preventing quantifiable Quality of Service guarantees, particularly for transmitting minimal structural semantics in emergency scenarios. This deficiency limits its evolution into a predictable engineering science. To address this, we establish a complete theoretical axiomatic basis for this problem. We propose four axioms and rigorously prove that the family of pairwise rank-Copulas is the minimal sufficient representation for minimal structural semantics. Based on this, we construct a semantic distortion metric, centered on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We then establish the core theoretical boundaries of the framework: sample complexity bounds; rate-distortion bounds; an end-to-end Service Level Agreements theorem; and a semantic source-channel separation theorem, which provides a provable Quality of Service guarantee. Finally, we validate our framework through decoupled experiments, empirically demonstrating that our core metric strictly adheres to our foundational axioms while standard perceptual metrics fail to do so.</description>

      <title>Frequency Diverse (FD)-RIS-Enhanced Covert Communications: Defense Against Wiretapping via Joint Distance-Angle Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the security blind zone challenges faced by traditional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided covert communication (CC) systems, the joint distance-angle beamforming capability of frequency diverse RIS (FD-RIS) shows significant potential for addressing these limitations. Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens. Simulation results demonstrate that FD-RIS can significantly improve covert performance, particularly in angular-overlap scenarios where traditional RIS experiences severe degradation. These findings further highlight the effectiveness of FD-RIS in enhancing CC robustness under challenging spatial environments.</description>

      <title>Future of AI Models: A Computational perspective on Model collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed domains such as software engineering, journalism, creative writing, academia, and media (Naveed et al. 2025; arXiv:2307.06435). Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion generate high-quality images and videos from text. Evidence shows rapid expansion: 74.2% of newly published webpages now contain AI-generated material (Ryan Law 2025), 30-40% of the active web corpus is synthetic (Spennemann 2025; arXiv:2504.08755), 52% of U.S. adults use LLMs for writing, coding, or research (Staff 2025), and audits find AI involvement in 18% of financial complaints and 24% of press releases (Liang et al. 2025). The underlying neural architectures, including Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2023; arXiv:1706.03762), RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and diffusion networks, depend on large, diverse, human-authored datasets (Shi &amp; Iyengar 2019). As synthetic content dominates, recursive training risks eroding linguistic and semantic diversity, producing Model Collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024; arXiv:2307.15043; Dohmatob et al. 2024; arXiv:2402.07712). This study quantifies and forecasts collapse onset by examining year-wise semantic similarity in English-language Wikipedia (filtered Common Crawl) from 2013 to 2025 using Transformer embeddings and cosine similarity metrics. Results reveal a steady rise in similarity before public LLM adoption, likely driven by early RNN/LSTM translation and text-normalization pipelines, though modest due to a smaller scale. Observed fluctuations reflect irreducible linguistic diversity, variable corpus size across years, finite sampling error, and an exponential rise in similarity after the public adoption of LLM models. These findings provide a data-driven estimate of when recursive AI contamination may significantly threaten data richness and model generalization.</description>

      <title>Compressing Chemistry Reveals Functional Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first formal large-scale assessment of the utility of traditional chemical functional groups as used in chemical explanations. Our assessment employs a fundamental principle from computational learning theory: a good explanation of data should also compress the data. We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle that searches for substructures that compress around three million biologically relevant molecules. We demonstrate that the discovered substructures contain most human-curated functional groups as well as novel larger patterns with more specific functions. We also run our algorithm on 24 specific bioactivity prediction datasets to discover dataset-specific functional groups. Fingerprints constructed from dataset-specific functional groups are shown to significantly outperform other fingerprint representations, including the MACCS and Morgan fingerprint, when training ridge regression models on bioactivity regression tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion Model Guidance through Calibration and Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05844v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Modular Bayesian Deep Receivers: Single-Step Adaptation with Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN)-based receivers offer a powerful alternative to classical model-based designs for wireless communication, especially in complex and nonlinear propagation environments. However, their adoption is challenged by the rapid variability of wireless channels, which makes pre-trained static DNN-based receivers ineffective, and by the latency and computational burden of online stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based learning. In this work, we propose an online learning framework that enables rapid low-complexity adaptation of DNN-based receivers. Our approach is based on two main tenets. First, we cast online learning as Bayesian tracking in parameter space, enabling a single-step adaptation, which deviates from multi-epoch SGD . Second, we focus on modular DNN architectures that enable parallel, online, and localized variational Bayesian updates. Simulations with practical communication channels demonstrate that our proposed online learning framework can maintain a low error rate with markedly reduced update latency and increased robustness to channel dynamics as compared to traditional gradient descent based method.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction and Secrecy under Approximate Distance Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of locating an unknown target point using approximate distance queries: in each round, a reconstructor selects a query point and receives a noisy version of its distance to the target. This problem arises naturally in various contexts ranging from localization in GPS and sensor networks to privacy-aware data access, and spans a wide variety of metric spaces. It is relevant from the perspective of both the reconstructor (seeking accurate recovery) and the responder (aiming to limit information disclosure, e.g., for privacy or security reasons). We study this reconstruction game through a learning-theoretic lens, focusing on the rate and limits of the best possible reconstruction error. Our first result provides a tight geometric characterization of the optimal error in terms of the Chebyshev radius, a classical concept from geometry. This characterization applies to all compact metric spaces (in fact, even to all totally bounded spaces) and yields explicit formulas for natural metric spaces. Our second result addresses the asymptotic behavior of reconstruction, distinguishing between pseudo-finite spaces -- where the optimal error is attained after finitely many queries -- and spaces where the approximation curve exhibits nontrivial decay. We characterize pseudo-finiteness for convex Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Route Experts by Sequence, not by Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures scale large language models (LLMs) by activating only a subset of experts per token, but the standard TopK routing assigns the same fixed number of experts to all tokens, ignoring their varying complexity. Prior adaptive routing methods introduce additional modules and hyperparameters, often requiring costly retraining from scratch. We propose Sequence-level TopK (SeqTopK), a minimal modification that shifts the expert budget from the token level to the sequence level. By selecting the top $T \cdot K$ experts across all $T$ tokens, SeqTopK enables end-to-end learned dynamic allocation -- assigning more experts to difficult tokens and fewer to easy ones -- while preserving the same overall budget. SeqTopK requires only a few lines of code, adds less than 1% overhead, and remains fully compatible with pretrained MoE models. Experiments across math, coding, law, and writing show consistent improvements over TopK and prior parameter-free adaptive methods, with gains that become substantially larger under higher sparsity (up to 16.9%). These results highlight SeqTopK as a simple, efficient, and scalable routing strategy, particularly well-suited for the extreme sparsity regimes of next-generation LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Y-Research-SBU/SeqTopK.</description>

      <title>Fast Bayesian Updates via Harmonic Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference, while foundational to probabilistic reasoning, is often hampered by the computational intractability of posterior distributions, particularly through the challenging evidence integral. Conventional approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Variational Inference (VI) face significant scalability and efficiency limitations. This paper introduces a novel, unifying framework for fast Bayesian updates by leveraging harmonic analysis. We demonstrate that representing the prior and likelihood in a suitable orthogonal basis transforms the Bayesian update rule into a spectral convolution. Specifically, the Fourier coefficients of the posterior are shown to be the normalized convolution of the prior and likelihood coefficients. To achieve computational feasibility, we introduce a spectral truncation scheme, which, for smooth functions, yields an exceptionally accurate finite-dimensional approximation and reduces the update to a circular convolution. This formulation allows us to exploit the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), resulting in a deterministic algorithm with O(N log N) complexity -- a substantial improvement over the O(N^2) cost of naive methods. We establish rigorous mathematical criteria for the applicability of our method, linking its efficiency to the smoothness and spectral decay of the involved distributions. The presented work offers a paradigm shift, connecting Bayesian computation to signal processing and opening avenues for real-time, sequential inference in a wide class of problems.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Asymptotics of Differentially Private PCA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In differential privacy, statistics of a sensitive dataset are privatized by introducing random noise. Most privacy analyses provide privacy bounds specifying a noise level sufficient to achieve a target privacy guarantee. Sometimes, these bounds are pessimistic and suggest adding excessive noise, which overwhelms the meaningful signal. It remains unclear if such high noise levels are truly necessary or a limitation of the proof techniques. This paper explores whether we can obtain sharp privacy characterizations that identify the smallest noise level required to achieve a target privacy level for a given mechanism. We study this problem in the context of differentially private principal component analysis, where the goal is to privatize the leading principal components (PCs) of a dataset with n samples and p features. We analyze the exponential mechanism for this problem in a model-free setting and provide sharp utility and privacy characterizations in the high-dimensional limit ($p\rightarrow\infty$). Our privacy result shows that, in high dimensions, detecting the presence of a target individual in the dataset using the privatized PCs is exactly as hard as distinguishing two Gaussians with slightly different means, where the mean difference depends on certain spectral properties of the dataset. Our privacy analysis combines the hypothesis-testing formulation of privacy guarantees proposed by Dong, Roth, and Su (2022) with classical contiguity arguments due to Le Cam to obtain sharp high-dimensional privacy characterizations.</description>

Abstract: With recent advancements in next-generation data storage, especially in biological molecule-based storage, insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention. However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in realistic DNA-based storage channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate coding schemes that map source symbols into multisets of an alphabet set. Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit{multiset combinatorial Gray code} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a \textit{color mapping} and the code as a \textit{color multiset code}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism. Some numerical results are presented to conclude the paper.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distribution Release of Gaussian Mixture Models via KL-Divergence Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However, recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy, we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility.</description>

      <title>Flexible MIMO for Future Wireless Communications: Which Flexibilities are Possible?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), static array configurations struggle in dynamic environments, and further antenna scaling is bounded by cost, energy, and footprint. Emerging approaches, which can enable next-generation wireless communication networks with modest spectrum availability by leveraging flexibility and adaptability rather than sheer array growth, are therefore needed. In this paper, we present a taxonomy framework, referred to as flexible MIMO technology, that systematically categorizes a wide range of evolving MIMO technologies. The focus is on MIMO technologies with flexible physical configurations and integrated applications. We categorize twelve representative flexible MIMO technologies into three major classifications: flexible deployment characteristics-based, flexible geometry characteristics-based, and flexible real-time modifications-based. We then comprehensively overview their fundamental characteristics, potential, and challenges. In addition, we highlight three vital enablers for flexible MIMO technology, including efficient channel state information acquisition schemes, low-complexity beamforming design, and explainable artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled optimization, and discuss eight representative sub-techniques. Finally, two brief case studies -- pre-optimized irregular array for high-speed railway network and cell-free movable antenna -- are presented, showing how flexible MIMO can open new design possibilities and inspire future research directions for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarforming is a promising technique that enables dynamic adjustment of antenna polarization to mitigate depolarization effects commonly encountered during electromagnetic (EM) wave propagation. In this letter, we investigate the polarforming design for secure wireless communication systems, where the base station (BS) is equipped with polarization-reconfigurable antennas (PRAs) and can flexibly adjust the antenna polarization to transmit confidential information to a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper. To maximize the achievable secrecy rate, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly optimize transmit beamforming and polarforming, where beamforming exploits spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to steer the transmit beam toward the user, while polarforming leverages polarization DoFs to align the polarization state of the EM wave received by the user with that of its antenna. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to conventional fixed-polarization antenna (FPA) systems, polarforming can fully exploit the DoFs in antenna polarization optimization to significantly enhance the security performance of wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Bandwidth-Efficient Semantic Communication with Adaptive Requests</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on conveying the intrinsic meaning of data rather than its raw symbolic representation. For visual content, this paradigm shifts from traditional pixel-level transmission toward leveraging the semantic structure of images to communicate visual meaning. Existing approaches are dominated by two routes: using text-only descriptions, which typically under-specify spatial layout and fine-grained appearance details; or transmitting text alongside dense latent visual features, which can over-specify semantics and introduce redundancy and bitrate overhead. A key challenge, therefore, is to reduce semantic redundancy while preserving semantic understanding and visual fidelity, thereby improving overall transmission efficiency. This paper introduces a diffusion-based semantic communication framework with adaptive retransmission. The system transmits concise text descriptions together with a limited set of key latent visual features, and employs a diffusion-based inpainting model to reconstruct the image. A receiver-side semantic consistency mechanism is designed to evaluate the alignment between the reconstructed image and the original text description. When a semantic discrepancy is detected, the receiver triggers a retransmission to request a small set of additional latent blocks and refine the image reconstruction. This approach significantly reduces bandwidth usage while preserving high semantic accuracy, achieving an efficient balance between reconstruction quality and transmission cost.</description>

      <title>Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</description>

      <title>Efficient and rate-optimal list-decoding in the presence of minimal feedback: Weldon and Slepian-Wolf in sheep's clothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a channel with length-$n$ inputs and outputs over the alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots,q-1\}$, and of which a fraction $\varrho \in (0,1-1/q)$ of symbols can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary, a fundamental problem is that of communicating at rates close to the information-theoretically optimal values, while ensuring the receiver can infer that the transmitter's message is from a ``small" set. While the existence of such codes is known, and constructions with computationally tractable encoding/decoding procedures are known for large $q$, we provide the first schemes that attain this performance for any $q \geq 2$, as long as low-rate feedback (asymptotically negligible relative to the number of transmissions) from the receiver to the transmitter is available. For any sufficiently small $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\varrho \in (1-{1}/{q}-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon}))$ our minimal feedback scheme has the following parameters: Rate $1-H_q(\varrho) - \varepsilon$ (i.e., $\varepsilon$-close to information-theoretically optimal -- here $H_q(\varrho)$ is the $q$-ary entropy function), list-size $\exp\left(\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-3/2}\log^2(1/\varepsilon)\right)\right)$, computational complexity of encoding/decoding $n^{\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(1/\varepsilon))}$, storage complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^{\eta+1}\log n)$ for a code design parameter $\eta&gt;1$ that trades off storage complexity with the probability of error. The error probability is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\eta})$, and the (vanishing) feedback rate is $\mathcal{O}({1}/{\sqrt{\log(n)}})$.</description>

      <title>Improving Uniquely Decodable Codes in Binary Adder Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general method to modify existing uniquely decodable codes in the $T$-user binary adder channel. If at least one of the original constituent codes does not have average weight exactly half of the dimension, then our method produces a new set of constituent codes in a higher dimension, with a strictly higher rate. Using our method we improve the highest known rate for the $T$-user binary adder channel for all $T \geq 2$. This information theory problem is equivalent to co-Sidon problems initiated by Lindstr{\"o}m in the 1960s, and also the multi-set union-free problem. Our results improve the known lower bounds in these settings as well.</description>

      <title>Zero-error communication under discrete-time Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an open quantum system with (discrete-time) Markovian dynamics. Our task is to store information in the system in such a way that it can be retrieved perfectly, even after the system is left to evolve for an arbitrarily long time. We show that this is impossible for classical (resp. quantum) information precisely when the dynamics is mixing (resp. asymptotically entanglement breaking). Furthermore, we provide tight universal upper bounds on the minimum time after which any such dynamics 'scrambles' the encoded information beyond the point of perfect retrieval. On the other hand, for dynamics that are not of this kind, we show that information must be encoded inside the peripheral space associated with the dynamics in order for it to be perfectly recoverable at any time in the future. This allows us to derive explicit formulas for the maximum amount of information that can be protected from noise in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Empowered Next-Generation MIMO Networks: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Visions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled next-generation MIMO networks. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO networks from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.</description>

      <title>When Should Selfish Miners Double-Spend?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional double-spending attack models ignore the revenue losses stemming from the orphan blocks. On the other hand, selfish mining literature usually ignores the chance of the attacker to double-spend at no-cost in each attack cycle. In this paper, we give a rigorous stochastic analysis of an attack where the goal of the adversary is to double-spend while mining selfishly. To do so, we first combine stubborn and selfish mining attacks, i.e., construct a strategy where the attacker acts stubborn until its private branch reaches a certain length and then switches to act selfish. We provide the optimal stubbornness for each parameter regime. Next, we provide the maximum stubbornness that is still more profitable than honest mining and argue a connection between the level of stubbornness and the $k$-confirmation rule. We show that, at each attack cycle, if the level of stubbornness is higher than $k$, the adversary gets a free shot at double-spending. At each cycle, for a given stubbornness level, we rigorously formulate how great the probability of double-spending is. We further modify the attack in the stubborn regime in order to conceal the attack and increase the double-spending probability.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant syndrome extraction in [[n,1,3]] non-CSS code family generated using measurements on graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliability of quantum computation critically depends on the performance of quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), which can be severely degraded by hook errors that reduce the effective code distance. In this work, we construct a family of $[[n,1,3]]$ non-CSS QECCs to achieve fault-tolerant (FT) syndrome measurement, where $ 6 \leq n \leq 10$. We employ the bare-ancilla method of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} to demonstrate fault tolerance in the presence of hook errors during syndrome extraction.
  We present a systematic protocol for generating these QECCs using graph codes.
  Using a custom lookup-table decoder, we simulate the code's performance under both anisotropic and circuit-level depolarizing noise. Our results reveal a trade-off in performance with respect to the code rate and identify optimized codes under these noise models. We benchmark our results against the infamous flag-qubit method of Chao \emph{et al.}. Notably, we introduce a code with improved code rate while maintaining the same distance as the work of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} Our approach facilitates the identification and construction of a family of distance three FT non-CSS QECCs.</description>

      <title>Secret-Key Generation from Private Identifiers under Channel Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates secret-key generation for device authentication using physical identifiers, such as responses from physical unclonable functions (PUFs). The system includes two legitimate terminals (encoder and decoder) and an eavesdropper (Eve), each with access to different measurements of the identifier. From the device identifier, the encoder generates a secret key, which is securely stored in a private database, along with helper data that is saved in a public database accessible by the decoder for key reconstruction. Eve, who also has access to the public database, may use both her own measurements and the helper data to attempt to estimate the secret key and identifier. Our setup focuses on authentication scenarios where channel statistics are uncertain, with the involved parties employing multiple antennas to enhance signal reception. Our contributions include deriving inner and outer bounds on the optimal trade-off among secret-key, storage, and privacy-leakage rates for general discrete sources, and showing that these bounds are tight for Gaussian sources.</description>

      <title>Error exponents of quantum state discrimination with composite correlated hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and identically distributed case to encompass composite correlated hypotheses. In particular, we introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their equivalence or quantitative relations. In the error exponent regime, we generalize the quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum states, demonstrating that the optimal Type-I error exponent, under an exponential constraint on the Type-II error, is precisely characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong converse exponent regime, we provide a general lower bound on the exponent in terms of the regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence and a matching upper bound when the null hypothesis is a singleton. The generality of these results enables applications in various contexts, including (i) refining the generalized quantum Stein's lemma by [Fang, Fawzi &amp; Fawzi, 2024]; (ii) exhibiting counterexamples to the continuity of the regularized Petz R\'enyi divergence and Hoeffding divergence; (iii) obtaining error exponents for adversarial channel discrimination and resource detection problems.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Dillon's APN Hexanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we undertake a systematic analysis of a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic 2 proposed by Dillon in 2006 as potential candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, pushing the analysis a lot further than what has been done via the partial APN concept in (Budaghyan et al., DCC 2020). These functions, defined over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ where $q=2^n$, have the form $F(x) = x(Ax^2 + Bx^q + Cx^{2q}) + x^2(Dx^q + Ex^{2q}) + x^{3q}.$ Using algebraic number theory and methods on algebraic varieties over finite fields, we establish necessary conditions on the coefficients $A, B, C, D, E$ that must hold for the corresponding function to be APN. Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that systematically excludes large classes of Dillon's hexanomials from being APN based on the vanishing patterns of certain key polynomials in the coefficients. Through a combination of number theory, algebraic-geometric techniques and computational verification, we identify specific algebraic obstructions-including the existence of absolutely irreducible components in associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations-that prevent these functions from achieving optimal differential uniformity. Our results significantly narrow the search space for new APN functions within this family and provide a theoretical roadmap applicable to other classes of potential APN functions. We complement our theoretical work with extensive computations. Through exhaustive searches on $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$ and random sampling on $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, we identified thousands of APN hexanomials, many of which are not CCZ-equivalent to the known Budaghyan-Carlet family (Budaghyan-Carlet, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th., 2008).</description>
