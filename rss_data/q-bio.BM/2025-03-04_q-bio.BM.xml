      <title>Leveraging Sequence Purification for Accurate Prediction of Multiple Conformational States with AlphaFold2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold2 (AF2) has transformed protein structure prediction by harnessing co-evolutionary constraints embedded in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). MSAs not only encode static structural information, but also hold critical details about protein dynamics, which underpin biological functions. However, these subtle co-evolutionary signatures, which dictate conformational state preferences, are often obscured by noise within MSA data and thus remain challenging to decipher. Here, we introduce AF-ClaSeq, a systematic framework that isolates these co-evolutionary signals through sequence purification and iterative enrichment. By extracting sequence subsets that preferentially encode distinct structural states, AF-ClaSeq enables high-confidence predictions of alternative conformations. Our findings reveal that the successful sampling of alternative states depends not on MSA depth but on sequence purity. Intriguingly, purified sequences encoding specific structural states are distributed across phylogenetic clades and superfamilies, rather than confined to specific lineages. Expanding upon AF2's transformative capabilities, AF-ClaSeq provides a powerful approach for uncovering hidden structural plasticity, advancing allosteric protein and drug design, and facilitating dynamics-based protein function annotation.</description>

      <title>Applying computational protein design to therapeutic antibody discovery -- current state and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning applications in protein sciences have ushered in a new era for designing molecules in silico. Antibodies, which currently form the largest group of biologics in clinical use, stand to benefit greatly from this shift. Despite the proliferation of these protein design tools, their direct application to antibodies is often limited by the unique structural biology of these molecules. Here, we review the current computational methods for antibody design, highlighting their role in advancing computational drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Pushing the boundaries of Structure-Based Drug Design through Collaboration with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) has revolutionized drug discovery by enabling the rational design of molecules for specific protein targets. Despite significant advancements in improving docking scores, advanced 3D-SBDD generative models still face challenges in producing drug-like candidates that meet medicinal chemistry standards and pharmacokinetic requirements. These limitations arise from their inherent focus on molecular interactions, often neglecting critical aspects of drug-likeness. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design (CIDD) framework, which combines the structural precision of 3D-SBDD models with the chemical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). CIDD begins by generating supporting molecules with 3D-SBDD models and then refines these molecules through LLM-supported modules to enhance drug-likeness and structural reasonability. When evaluated on the CrossDocked2020 dataset, CIDD achieved a remarkable success ratio of 37.94%, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art benchmark of 15.72%. Although improving molecular interactions and drug-likeness is often seen as a trade-off, CIDD uniquely achieves a balanced improvement in both by leveraging the complementary strengths of different models, offering a robust and innovative pathway for designing therapeutically promising drug candidates.</description>

      <title>POSERS: Steganography-Driven Molecular Tagging Using Randomized DNA Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses a significant challenge across multiple industries, leading to financial losses and health risks. While DNA-based molecular tagging has emerged as a promising anti-counterfeiting strategy, existing methods rely on predefined DNA sequences, making them vulnerable to replication as sequencing and synthesis technologies advance. To address these limitations, we introduce POSERS (Position-Oriented Scattering of Elements among a Randomized Sequence), a steganographic tagging system embedded within DNA sequences. POSERS ensures copy- and forgery-proof authentication by adding restrictions within randomized DNA libraries, enhancing security against counterfeiting attempts. The POSERS design allows the complexity of the libraries to be adjusted based on the customer's needs while ensuring they withstand the ongoing improvements in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies. We mathematically validate its security properties and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness using Next-Generation Sequencing and an authentication test, successfully distinguishing genuine POSERS tags from counterfeit ones. Our results highlight the potential of POSERS as a long-term, adaptable solution for secure product authentication.</description>

      <title>Discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides with notable antibacterial potency by a LLM-based foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in chemistry and biomedical research, acting as versatile foundation models for various tasks. We introduce AMP-Designer, an LLM-based approach for swiftly designing novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with desired properties. Within 11 days, AMP-Designer achieved the de novo design of 18 AMPs with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria. In vitro validation revealed a 94.4% success rate, with two candidates demonstrating exceptional antibacterial efficacy, minimal hemotoxicity, stability in human plasma, and low potential to induce resistance, as evidenced by significant bacterial load reduction in murine lung infection experiments. The entire process, from design to validation, concluded in 48 days. AMP-Designer excels in creating AMPs targeting specific strains despite limited data availability, with a top candidate displaying a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2.0 {\mu}g/ml against Propionibacterium acnes. Integrating advanced machine learning techniques, AMP-Designer demonstrates remarkable efficiency, paving the way for innovative solutions to antibiotic resistance.</description>

      <title>Procedural Synthesis of Synthesizable Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing synthetically accessible molecules and recommending analogs to unsynthesizable molecules are important problems for accelerating molecular discovery. We reconceptualize both problems using ideas from program synthesis. Drawing inspiration from syntax-guided synthesis approaches, we decouple the syntactic skeleton from the semantics of a synthetic tree to create a bilevel framework for reasoning about the combinatorial space of synthesis pathways. Given a molecule we aim to generate analogs for, we iteratively refine its skeletal characteristics via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations over the space of syntactic skeletons. Given a black-box oracle to optimize, we formulate a joint design space over syntactic templates and molecular descriptors and introduce evolutionary algorithms that optimize both syntactic and semantic dimensions synergistically. Our key insight is that once the syntactic skeleton is set, we can amortize over the search complexity of deriving the program's semantics by training policies to fully utilize the fixed horizon Markov Decision Process imposed by the syntactic template. We demonstrate performance advantages of our bilevel framework for synthesizable analog generation and synthesizable molecule design. Notably, our approach offers the user explicit control over the resources required to perform synthesis and biases the design space towards simpler solutions, making it particularly promising for autonomous synthesis platforms.

      <title>Learning to engineer protein flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models are increasingly being used to design novel proteins for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. However, the current methods mostly focus on the design of proteins with a fixed backbone structure, which leads to their limited ability to account for protein flexibility, one of the crucial properties for protein function. Learning to engineer protein flexibility is problematic because the available data are scarce, heterogeneous, and costly to obtain using computational as well as experimental methods. Our contributions to address this problem are three-fold. First, we comprehensively compare methods for quantifying protein flexibility and identify data relevant to learning. Second, we design and train flexibility predictors utilizing sequential or both sequential and structural information on the input. We overcome the data scarcity issue by leveraging a pre-trained protein language model. Third, we introduce a method for fine-tuning a protein inverse folding model to steer it toward desired flexibility in specified regions. We demonstrate that our method Flexpert-Design enables guidance of inverse folding models toward increased flexibility. This opens up new possibilities for protein flexibility engineering and the development of proteins with enhanced biological activities.</description>

      <title>Struc2mapGAN: improving synthetic cryo-EM density maps with generative adversarial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating synthetic cryogenic electron microscopy 3D density maps from molecular structures has potential important applications in structural biology. Yet existing simulation-based methods cannot mimic all the complex features present in experimental maps, such as secondary structure elements. As an alternative, we propose struc2mapGAN, a novel data-driven method that employs a generative adversarial network to produce improved experimental-like density maps from molecular structures. More specifically, struc2mapGAN uses a nested U-Net architecture as the generator, with an additional L1 loss term and further processing of raw training experimental maps to enhance learning efficiency. While struc2mapGAN can promptly generate maps after training, we demonstrate that it outperforms existing simulation-based methods for a wide array of tested maps and across various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>What Ails Generative Structure-based Drug Design: Expressivity is Too Little or Too Much?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several generative models with elaborate training and sampling procedures have been proposed to accelerate structure-based drug design (SBDD); however, their empirical performance turns out to be suboptimal. We seek to better understand this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Since most of these models apply graph neural networks (GNNs), one may suspect that they inherit the representational limitations of GNNs. We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup. Collectively, our findings underscore the need to reassess and redirect the existing paradigm and efforts for SBDD. Code is available at https://github.com/rafalkarczewski/SimpleSBDD.</description>
