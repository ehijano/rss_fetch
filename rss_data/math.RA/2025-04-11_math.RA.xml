      <title>Majorization for probability distributions, column stochastic matrices and their linear preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate majorization for probability distributions and column stochastic matrices. We show that majorizations in general can be reduced to these sets. We characterize linear operators that preserve majorization for probability distributions, and show their equivalence to operators preserving vector majorization. Our main result provides a complete characterization of linear preservers of strong majorization for column stochastic matrices, revealing a richer structure of preservers, than in the standard setting. As a prerequisite to this characterization, we solve the problem of characterizing linear preservers of majorization for zero-sum vectors, which yields a new structural insight into the classical results of Ando and of Li and Poon.</description>

      <title>Hecke-Clifford algebras at roots of unity and conformal embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a combinatorial description of the Cauchy completion of the categories $\mathcal{E}_q$ and $\overline{\mathcal{SE}_N}$ recently introduced by the first author and Snyder. This in turns gives a combinatorial description of the categories $\overline{\operatorname{Rep}(U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_N))}_{A}$ where $A$ is the \`etale algebra object corresponding to the conformal embedding $\mathfrak{sl}_N$ level $N$ into $\mathfrak{so}_{N^2-1}$ level 1. In particular we give a classification of the simple objects of these categories, a formula for their quantum dimensions, and fusion rules for tensoring with the defining object. Our method of obtaining these results is the Schur-Weyl approach of studying the representation theory of certain endomorphism algebras in $\mathcal{E}_q$ and $\mathcal{SE}_N$, which are known to be subalgebras of Hecke-Clifford algebras. We build on existing literature to study the representation theory of the Hecke-Clifford algebras at roots of unity.</description>

      <title>Additive diameters of group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the concept of additive diameters in the context of group representations, unifying various noncommutative Waring-type problems. Given a finite-dimensional representation $\rho \colon G \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ and a subspace $U \leq V$ that generates $V$ as a $G$-module, we define the $G$-additive diameter of $V$ with respect to $U$ as the minimal number of translates of $U$ under the representation $\rho$ needed to cover $V$. We demonstrate that every irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{C})$ exhibits optimal additive diameters and establish sharp bounds for the conjugation representation of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{C})$ on its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\mathbf{C})$. Additionally, we investigate analogous notions for additive diameters in Lie representations. We provide applications to additive diameters with respect to images of equivariant algebraic morphisms, linking them to the corresponding $G$-additive diameters of images of their differentials.</description>

      <title>Equivariant recollements and singular equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate equivariant recollements of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We first characterize when a recollement of abelian (resp. triangulated) categories induces an equivariant recollement, i.e. a recollement between the corresponding equivariant abelian (resp. triangulated) categories. We further investigate singular equivalences in the context of equivariant abelian recollements. In particular, we characterize when a singular equivalence induced by the quotient functor in an abelian recollement lift to a singular equivalence induced by the equivariant quotient functor. As applications of our results: (i) we construct equivariant recollements for the derived category of a quasi-compact, quasi-separated scheme where the action is coming from a subgroup of the automorphism group of the scheme and (ii) we derive new singular equivalences between certain skew group algebras.</description>

      <title>Homological full-and-faithfulness of comodule inclusion and contramodule forgetful functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a conilpotent coalgebra $C$ over a field $k$. Let $\Upsilon\colon C\textsf{-Comod}\longrightarrow C^*\textsf{-Mod}$ be the natural functor of inclusion of the category of $C$-comodules into the category of $C^*$-modules, and let $\Theta\colon C\textsf{-Contra}\longrightarrow C^*\textsf{-Mod}$ be the natural forgetful functor. We prove that the functor $\Upsilon$ induces a fully faithful triangulated functor on bounded (below) derived categories if and only if the functor $\Theta$ induces a fully faithful triangulated functor on bounded (above) derived categories, and if and only if the $k$-vector space $\operatorname{Ext}_C^n(k,k)$ is finite-dimensional for all $n\ge0$. We call such coalgebras "weakly finitely Koszul".</description>

      <title>Skew bracoids containing a skew brace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skew bracoids have been shown to have applications in Hopf-Galois theory. We show that a certain family of skew bracoids correspond bijectively with left cancellative semibraces. A consequence of this correspondence is that skew bracoids in this family can be used to obtain and study solutions of the set-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation; we study this process and the resulting solutions. We give numerous examples of skew bracoids satisfying our hypothesis, drawing upon a variety of constructions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Varieties of MV-monoids and positive MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MV-monoids are algebras $\langle A,\vee,\wedge, \oplus,\odot, 0,1\rangle$ where $\langle A, \vee, \wedge, 0, 1\rangle$ is a bounded distributive lattice, both $\langle A, \oplus, 0 \rangle$ and $\langle A, \odot, 1\rangle$ are commutative monoids, and some further connecting axioms are satisfied. Every MV-algebra in the signature $\{\oplus,\neg,0\}$ is term equivalent to an algebra that has an MV-monoid as a reduct, by defining, as standard, $1:= \neg 0$, $x \odot y := \neg(\neg x \oplus\neg y)$, $x \vee y := (x \odot \neg y) \oplus y$ and $x \wedge y := \neg(\neg x \vee \neg y)$. Particular examples of MV-monoids are positive MV-algebras, i.e. the $\{\vee, \wedge, \oplus, \odot, 0, 1\}$-subreducts of MV-algebras. Positive MV-algebras form a peculiar quasivariety in the sense that, albeit having a logical motivation (being the quasivariety of subreducts of MV-algebras), it is not the equivalent quasivariety semantics of any logic. In this paper, we study the lattices of subvarieties of MV-monoids and of positive MV-algebras. In particular, we characterize and axiomatize all almost minimal varieties of MV-monoids, we characterize the finite subdirectly irreducible positive MV-algebras, and we characterize and axiomatize all varieties of positive MV-algebras.</description>

      <title>Projection algebras and free projection- and idempotent-generated regular $*$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new family of semigroups - the free projection-generated regular $*$-semigroups - and initiate their systematic study. Such a semigroup $PG(P)$ is constructed from a projection algebra $P$, using the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups. The assignment $P\mapsto PG(P)$ is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that maps a regular $*$-semigroup $S$ to its projection algebra $P(S)$. In fact, the category of projection algebras is coreflective in the category of regular $*$-semigroups. The algebra $P(S)$ uniquely determines the biordered structure of the idempotents $E(S)$, up to isomorphism, and this leads to a category equivalence between projection algebras and regular $*$-biordered sets. As a consequence, $PG(P)$ can be viewed as a quotient of the classical free idempotent-generated (regular) semigroups $IG(E)$ and $RIG(E)$, where $E=E(PG(P))$; this is witnessed by a number of presentations in terms of generators and defining relations. The semigroup $PG(P)$ can also be interpreted topologically, through a natural link to the fundamental groupoid of a simplicial complex explicitly constructed from $P$. The theory is then illustrated on a number of examples. In one direction, the free construction applied to the projection algebras of adjacency semigroups yields a new family of graph-based path semigroups. In another, it turns out that, remarkably, the Temperley-Lieb monoid $TL_n$ is the free regular $*$-semigroup over its own projection algebra $P(TL_n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores applications of the so-called Freese's technique, a classical approach to study the congruence variety of a given algebra. We leverage this tool to investigate lattices that are admissible as congruence sublattice of a given algebra. In particular, we present a novel characterization of congruence modular varieties, Taylor varieties, and varieties satisfying a non-trivial congruence identity by means of lattice omission.</description>

      <title>On exterior powers of reflection representations, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a group endowed with a finite set $S$ of generators. A representation $(V,\rho)$ of $W$ is called a reflection representation of $(W,S)$ if $\rho(s)$ is a (generalized) reflection on $V$ for each generator $s \in S$. In this paper, we prove that for any irreducible reflection representation $V$, all the exterior powers $\bigwedge ^d V$, $d = 0, 1, \dots, \dim V$, are irreducible $W$-modules, and they are non-isomorphic to each other. This extends a theorem of R. Steinberg which is stated for Euclidean reflection groups. Moreover, we prove that the exterior powers (except for the 0th and the highest power) of two non-isomorphic reflection representations always give non-isomorphic $W$-modules. This allows us to construct numerous pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible representations for such groups, especially for Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Torsion-free Modules over Commutative Domains of Krull Dimension One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a domain of Krull dimension one, we study when the class $\mathcal{F}$ of modules over $R$ that are arbitrary direct sums of finitely generated torsion-free modules is closed under direct summands. If $R$ is local, we show that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under direct summands if and only if any indecomposable, finitely generated, torsion-free module has local endomorphism ring. If, in addition, $R$ is noetherian this is equivalent to say that the normalization of $R$ is a local ring. If $R$ is an $h$-local domain of Krull dimension $1$ and $\mathcal{F}_R$ is closed under direct summands, then the property is inherited by the localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. Moreover, any localizations of $R$ at a maximal ideal, except maybe one, satisfies that any finitely generated ideal is $2$-generated. The converse is true when the domain $R$ is, in addition, integrally closed, or noetherian semilocal or noetherian with module-finite normalization. Finally, over a commutative domain of finite character and with no restriction on the Krull dimension, we show that the isomorphism classes of countable generated modules in $\mathcal{F}$ are determined by their genus.</description>
