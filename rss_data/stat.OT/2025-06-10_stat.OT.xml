      <title>One-dimensional quantile-stratified sampling and its application in statistical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine quantile-stratified samples from a known univariate probability distribution, with stratification occurring over a partition of the quantile regions in the distribution. We examine some general properties of this sampling method and we contrast it with standard IID sampling to highlight its similarities and differences. We examine the applications of this sampling method to various statistical simulations including importance sampling. We conduct simulation analysis to compare the performance of standard importance sampling against the quantile-stratified importance sampling to see how they each perform on a range of functions.</description>

      <title>Oral exams in introductory statistics class with non-native English speakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oral exams are a powerful tool to assess student's learning. This is particularly important in introductory statistics classes where students struggle to grasp various topics like the interpretation of probability, $p$-values and more. The challenge of acquiring conceptual understanding is only heightened when students are learning in a second language. In this paper, I share my experience administering oral exams to an introductory statistics class of non-native English speakers at a Japanese university. I explain the context of the university and course, before detailing the exam. Of particular interest is the relationship between exam performance and English proficiency. The results showed little relationship between the two, meaning the exam seemed to truly test student's statistical knowledge rather than their English ability. I close with encouragements and recommendations for practitioners hoping to implement similar oral exams, focusing on the unique difficulties faced by students not learning in their mother tongue.</description>
