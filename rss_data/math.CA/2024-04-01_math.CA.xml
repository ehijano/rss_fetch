      <title>Sinc method in spectrum completion and inverse Sturm-Liouville problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinal series representations for solutions of the Sturm-Liouville equation $-y''+q(x)y=\rho^{2}y$, $x\in(0,L)$ with a complex valued potential $q(x)$ are obtained, by using the corresponding transmutation operator. Consequently, partial sums of the series approximate the solutions uniformly with respect to $\rho$ in any strip $\left|\text{Im}\rho\right|&lt;C$ of the complex plane. This property of the obtained series representations leads to their applications in a variety of spectral problems. In particular, we show their applicability to the spectrum completion problem, consisting in computing large sets of the eigenvalues from a reduced finite set of known eigenvalues, without any information on the potential $q(x)$ as well as on the constants from boundary conditions. Among other applications this leads to an efficient numerical method for computing a Weyl function from two finite sets of the eigenvalues. This possibility is explored in the present work and illustrated by numerical tests. Finally, based on the cardinal series representations obtained, we develop a method for the numerical solution of the inverse two-spectra Sturm-Liouville problem and show its numerical efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Normalization Theorem in Asymptotic Differential Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the universal exponential extension of an algebraically closed differential field and investigate its properties in the presence of a nice valuation and in connection with linear differential equations. Next we prove normalization theorems for algebraic differential equations over $H$-fields, as a tool in solving such equations in suitable extensions. The results in this monograph are essential in our work on Hardy fields in [6].</description>

      <title>A Fourier Inversion Theorem for Normal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an inversion theorem for the Fourier transform defined for normal functions, in the case when such functions are of moderate decrease, and in dimensions 2 and 3. This improves on Carleson's general almost everywhere convergence result for square integrable functions to everywhere convergence, in the special case of normal functions of moderate decrease. The class of normal functions appear in Physics and the everywhere convergence is important for further analysis of wave equations and no radiation properties of electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>An existence and uniqueness result to evolution equations with sign-changing pseudo-differential operators and its applications to logarithmic Laplacian operators and second-order differential operators without ellipticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We broaden the domain of the Fourier transform to contain all distributions without using the Paley-Wiener theorem and devise a new weak formulation built upon this extension. This formulation is applicable to evolution equations involving pseudo-differential operators, even when the signs of their symbols may vary over time. Notably, our main operator includes the logarithmic Laplacian operator $\log (-\Delta)$ and a second-order differential operator whose leading coefficients are not positive semi-definite.</description>

      <title>Spherical Particle in Nematic Liquid Crystal with a Magnetic Field and Planar Anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study minimizers of the Landau-de Gennes energy in $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus B_1(0)$ with external magnetic field in the large particle limit. We impose strong tangential anchoring and uniaxiality of the $Q-$tensor on the boundary. We derive a lower bound for the energy in terms of the boundary condition and show in the extreme cases that the longitudinal director field is energy minimizing, indicating the presence of two half-point defects, so called boojums, at two opposite points of the sphere. Using a recovery sequence, we show that the energy bound is optimal.</description>

      <title>A new form of asymptotic expansion for non-smooth differential equations with time-decaying forcing functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is focused on the asymptotic expansions, as time tends to infinity, of decaying solutions of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The nonlinear terms in the system may not be smooth in a small neighborhood of the origin. The forcing function decays to zero in a very complicated but coherent way. We prove that, under suitable conditions on the forcing function, every decaying solution admits the same asymptotic expansion of a new type. This expansion contains a new variable that allows it to be established in a closed-form, but does not affect the meaning and precision of the expansion. The new variable is introduced to overcome the unsuitability of certain terms resulted from the scaling and shifting method, which is used to deal with the lack of smoothness of the nonlinear terms, and the general form of the forcing function. Moreover, the expansion is constructed explicitly with the use of the complexification method.</description>

      <title>Spherical maximal functions and Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Hardy spaces for Fourier integral operators to obtain bounds for spherical maximal functions in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, $n\geq2$, where the radii of the spheres are restricted to a compact subset of $(0,\infty)$. These bounds extend to general hypersurfaces with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature, to the complex spherical means, and to geodesic spheres on compact manifolds. We also obtain improved maximal function bounds and pointwise convergence statements for wave equations, both on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and on compact manifolds. The maximal function bounds are essentially sharp for all $p\in[1,2]\cup [\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1},\infty]$, for each such hypersurface, every complex spherical mean, and on every manifold.</description>
