      <title>Electrical Impedance Tomography with an Integrated Picoliter-Volume Subtractive Microfluidic Chamber in 65 nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography with fully integrated microfluidics and electronics is presented for the first time in a CMOS chip. Chambers and electrodes are fabricated in the interconnect layers of a 65 nm CMOS chip through post-processing, enabling picoliter-volumes to be processed and imaged. Tomography maps are reconstructed by reading out voltages from a 16-element electrode array and processing the data off-chip, and sources of variation in reconstruction are discussed. The EIT system presented in this work serves as a proof-of-concept towards using CMOS as a platform for co-integrated microfluidics and electronics.</description>

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2025 Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third ``Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter'' (MD$\nu$DM'25) meeting was held May 20-23, 2025 in Yokohama, Japan, hosted by the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). These proceedings compile contributions from the workshop and update the progress of mineral detector research. MD$\nu$DM'25 was the third such meeting, following the first in October of 2022 held at the IFPU in Trieste, Italy and the second in January of 2024 hosted by the Center for Neutrino Physics at Virginia Tech in Arlington, USA. Mineral detectors record and retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral samples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and micro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales relevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and dark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as the energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors which record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small mineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by astrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A series of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution of these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system and the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary, incorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics, materials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis. Although realizing the scientific potential of mineral detectors poses many challenges, the MD$\nu$DM community looks forward to the continued development of mineral detector experiments and the possible discoveries that mineral detectors could reveal.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network enhanced multispectral single-pixel imaging with a chip spectral sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispectral imaging (MSI) captures data across multiple spectral bands, offering enhanced informational depth compared to standard RGB imaging and benefiting diverse fields such as agriculture, medical diagnostics, and industrial inspection. Conventional MSI systems, however, suffer from high cost, complexity, and limited performance in low-light conditions. Moreover, data-driven MSI methods depend heavily on large, labeled training datasets and struggle with generalization. In this work, we present a portable multispectral single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral sensor for system miniaturization and leverages an untrained physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct high-quality spectral images without the need for labeled training data. The physics-informed structure of the network enables the self-corrected reconstruction of multispectral images directly with the input of raw measurements from the multispectral sensor. Our proof-of-concept prototype achieves the reconstruction of 12-channel high-quality spectral images at the sampling rate of 10%. We also experimentally validate its performance under varying sampling rate conditions, by comparing it with conventional compressive sensing algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this technique to an MSI-based image segmentation task, in which spatial regions are discriminated according to their characteristic spectral signatures. This compact, high-fidelity, and portable approach offers promising pathways to lightweight and cost-effective spectral imaging on mobile platforms.</description>

      <title>Photon identification using the Hough transform in imaging calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon identification in calorimeters represents a crucial challenge in particle physics experiments, especially in high-density environments where shower overlap probabilities become significant. We present an energy-core-based photon identification method that exploits the distinct compact energy core feature of electromagnetic showers through Hough transform pattern recognition in imaging calorimeters. The method, validated through simulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates outstanding performance. It achieves a high identification efficiency of nearly 100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency approaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons when the distance between them reaches the granularity limit of the calorimeter. This advanced energy-core-based photon identification method integrated with an energy splitting technique enhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool for imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon detection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.</description>

      <title>EPICS for Small-Scale Laboratories with Python Soft IOCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is widely used at large laboratories for slow controls and instrumentation, the deployment of a full EPICS installation can be difficult, with a steep learning curve to new users. Taking advantage of the pythonSoftIOC module, we developed an EPICS slow controls implementation for Jefferson Lab's Hall B cryotarget written entirely in Python and based on software IOCs that communicate with instruments over Ethernet. This system ran successfully, interfacing with Jefferson Lab's full EPICS network, and we offer it as an example of the capabilities of pythonSoftIOC to build lightweight, yet robust and flexible instrumentation platforms that would be easily adapted for use at a small-scale laboratory. University groups can use these examples to build complete slow controls systems, from device communication to data archiving and display, using open-source, mature EPICS tools and student-friendly Python as an alternative to expensive and proprietary systems such as LabView.</description>

      <title>Dipole Localization Using An Integrated Radio Frequency Atomic Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to reject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of local sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the detection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now demonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are used to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The methodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two different positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known orientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of measuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their environment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of hidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer to make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it is to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working simultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of a fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are safely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The portable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in the field work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low gain avalanche diodes with DC- and AC-coupled readout were exposed to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation at levels relevant to future experiments in particle, nuclear, and medical physics and to astrophysics. Damage-related change in their acceptor removal constants and in the resistivity of the region between the guard ring and the active area are reported, as is change in the leakage current and depletion voltages of the active volumes.</description>

      <title>Titanium for rare-event searches: Hydrofluoric acid-free etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-event search experiments require construction materials with high radiopurity to minimise background contributions. Thanks to its high mechanical strength, low density, machinability, and commercial availability in relatively radio-pure forms, titanium is a suitable material for structural elements in rare event searches. To remove surface deposits on materials used, a chemical etching stage is usually performed. However, the chemical resistance of titanium means that, conventionally, such etching is done with hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid presents serious health risks to users, and such hazards are compounded in the case of construction in deep underground laboratories. An alternative chemical etching using sulphuric acid is presented. This is demonstrated to etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\mu$m of material from the surface over the course of 20 hours. Scanning electron microscopy with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the surface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface contaminants after etching. The proposed method is a potential alternative to those currently employed.</description>

      <title>ParaFlow: fast calorimeter simulations parameterized in upstream material configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study whether machine-learning models for fast calorimeter simulations can learn meaningful representations of calorimeter signatures that account for variations in the full particle detector's configuration. This may open new opportunities in high-energy physics measurements, for example in the assessment of systematic uncertainties that are related to the detector geometry, in the inference of properties of the detector configuration, or in the automated design of experiments. As a concrete example, we parameterize normalizing-flow-based simulations in configurations of the material upstream of a toy calorimeter. We call this model ParaFlow, which is trained to interpolate between different material budgets and positions, as simulated with Geant4. We study ParaFlow's performance in terms of photon shower shapes that are directly influenced by the properties of the upstream material, in which photons can convert to an electron-positron pair. In general, we find that ParaFlow is able to reproduce the dependence of the shower shapes on the material properties at the few-percent level with larger differences only in the tails of the distributions.</description>

      <title>A response matrix determined with a coincidence-based acquisition for correction of charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved photon counting detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.</description>

      <title>Impact of angle-dependent recombination on neutrino energy reconstruction in LArTPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The technology of Liquid Argon Time-Projection Chambers (LArTPC) plays a very important role in modern neutrino physics. It allows precise tracking and calorimetry in detectors with very large volume and mass. One important component of LArTPC calorimetric energy reconstruction is the electron-ion recombination effect. Existing experiments have provided constraints to its empirical description, including an explicit dependence on the particle's angle with respect to the TPC's electric field.
  In this paper we analyze the impact of angle-dependent recombination models on the reconstruction of neutrino energy in LArTPCs. We examine in detail the predictions of the existing models, showing that there is still considerable uncertainty for the angular dependence prediction at the low values of $dE/dx$ typical of minimum ionizing particles. We apply a simple correction to overcome unphysical predictions in the non-constrained energy loss regions and evaluate the consequences of that in the bias and linearity of electron neutrino energy responses, using generator-level and electron shower simulations for neutrino energies in the range of 0.5-5 GeV. Comparing prediction with and without angular-dependence, we observe an average energy bias between -0.9\% at 0.5 GeV and -0.6\% at 5 GeV. While small, these values are close to the typical requirement of 2\% for the energy scale uncertainty of future experiments, and indicate the need to obtain actual experimental constraints at low $dE/dx$ and take the effect into account in order to achieve the best precision in future LAr TPC electron neutrino calorimetry.</description>
