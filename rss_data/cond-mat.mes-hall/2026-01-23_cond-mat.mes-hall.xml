      <title>In-Substrate Imaging of Diamond hBN FET Current via Widefield Quantum Diamond Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate widefield magnetic imaging of current flow in hydrogen terminated diamond field effect transistors (FETs) through in-substrate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Hydrogen termination of the diamond surface induces a two dimensional hole gas (2DHG), while an ensemble of near surface NV centers located $ \sim 1~\mu m$ below the surface enables noninvasive magnetic imaging of current flow with micrometer scale spatial resolution. The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\sim 600-900 \mu A$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Field-Effect Three-Terminal Electronic Device with an Electron Mobility Exceeding 40 Million cm^2/(Vs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and operation of a source-drain-gate three-terminal field-effect electronic device with an electron mobility exceeding $40\times 10^6$ cm$^2$ / (Vs). Several devices were fabricated, with the highest achieved electron mobility obtained using a symmetrically-doped GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well forming a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a density of $1.47(1) \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a pristine, pre-fabrication electron mobility of $44(2) \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/(\text{Vs}). To circumvent the well-known degradation of electron mobility during fabrication, devices were fabricated using a flip-chip technique where all lithographic processing steps were performed on a separate sapphire substrate. This method demonstrates the successful operation of various gate assembly designs on distinct 2DEGs without observable mobility degradation. This advance doubles the previous record for field-effect electronic device mobility and enables access to new regimes of quantum transport and applications that were previously unfathomable due to mobility limitations.</description>

      <title>Disparate Quantum Corrections to Conduction in Carbon Nanotube Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference effects such as weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) normally yield consistent electronic phase-coherence lengths in homogeneous conductors. Here we show that in individual carbon nanotube bundles exfoliated from highly conductive solution-spun fibers, different probes, including the field scales and magnitudes of WL and UCF and nonlocal magnetoconductance, lead to strikingly disparate estimates of coherence lengths. WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Anomalous valley Hall dynamics of exciton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent and multiple Andreev reflections in Ge hut nanowire Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of induced superconductivity in Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions. The Ge hut nanowires are grown on prepatterned SiGe ridges via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and Josephson junction devices are fabricated by contacting the nanowires with Al electrodes. Low-temperature current-bias transport measurements of the Josephson junctions are performed and the measurements show that the devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrent and excess current. The analysis of excess current indicates that the transparency of the Ge hut nanowire Josephson junctions is as high as 85%. Voltage-bias spectroscopy measurements of the devices show multiple Andreev reflections up to the fourth order. With magnetic field and temperature-dependent measurements of the multiple Andreev reflections, the critical field and the critical temperature of the induced superconductivity in the Josephson junctions are extracted to be ~0.12 T and ~1.4 K. The success in introducing superconductivity into Ge hut nanowires will stimulate their applications in building advanced quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Localized emission in MoSe$_2$ monolayers on GaN nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) in two-dimensional semiconductors offer compact, chip-compatible sources for quantum photonics. In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), nanopillars are widely used to induce localized emission, yet the underlying confinement mechanism and the relative roles of strain versus dielectric environment remain unclear. The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone. More broadly, this combined optical-mechanical characterization approach provides a general framework for mapping structure-property relationships in 2D quantum materials at the single-emitter level.</description>

      <title>Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall Effect at 0.002T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene enables precise carrier-density control via gating, making it an ideal platform for studying electronic interactions. However, sample inhomogeneities often limit access to the low-density regimes where these interactions dominate. Enhancing carrier mobility is therefore crucial for exploring fundamental properties and developing device applications. Here, we demonstrate a significant reduction in external inhomogeneity using a double-layer graphene architecture separated by an ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride layer. Mutual screening between the layers reduces scattering from random Coulomb potentials, resulting in a quantum mobility exceeding. Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations emerge at magnetic fields below 1 mT, while integer quantum Hall features are observed at 0.002T. Furthermore, we identify a fractional quantum Hall plateau at a filling factor of at 2T. These results demonstrate the platform's suitability for investigating strongly correlated electronic phases in graphene-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Helical Current of Propagating Dirac Electrons and Geometric Coupling to Chiral Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a propagating Dirac electron with intrinsic spin generically carries a real--space helical conserved current, even in the absence of orbital angular momentum. Using exact Dirac eigenstates in cylindrical confinement, we demonstrate that this helical structure possesses definite handedness, persists into evanescent regions, and is characterized by a geometric helix pitch independent of the longitudinal de~Broglie wavelength. This intrinsic helical geometry enables a local geometric coupling between a propagating electron and a chiral environment, yielding chirality--dependent spin selectivity through current geometry rather than through a spin--orbit coupling term.</description>

      <title>From many valleys to many topological phases - quantum anomalous Hall effect in IV-VI semiconductor quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent with prior qualitative expectations for group IV-VI topological crystalline insulators, this work demonstrates, based on band structure and Chern number calculations, that Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se/(PbSe)$_{1-y}$(EuS)$_y$ quantum wells constitute a promising and viable platform for realizing a variety of quantum anomalous Hall phases. The proposed basis transformation procedure for the multiband $\mathit{k} \cdot \mathit{p}$ Hamiltonian enables the treatment of wells grown along arbitrary crystallographic directions while explicitly accounting for the anisotropy of the material's isoenergetic surfaces. Numerical studies of $\langle 111\rangle$-, $\langle 110\rangle$- and $\langle 001\rangle$-oriented quantum wells predict attainable Chern numbers with magnitudes ranging from $1$ to $4$, depending on the quantum well width, Sn content, and relative orientation of the four projected $\mathrm{L}$ valleys with respect to the growth direction. The results further indicate that appropriate strain compensation is required to achieve high-quality quantization of the Hall conductance.</description>

      <title>Magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically predict that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can induce magnon equilibrium spin current in collinear antiferromagnets. Such a current, being a response to the effective magnon vector potential, can be considered as magnon analog of the superconducting supercurrent or the persistent current. Large amplitude of the predicted effect may compensate for the smallness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, making the equilibrium spin currents to be experimentally observed. We suggest that external electric field can play the role of effective flux magnons interact with and propose an experiment based on the interference of magnons in the ring geometry as a verification of the concept.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Heterogeneity in Physical Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks typically train linear synaptic weights while treating device nonlinearities as fixed. We show the opposite - by training the synaptic nonlinearity itself, as in Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) architectures, we yield markedly higher task performance per physical resource and improved performance-parameter scaling than conventional linear weight-based networks, demonstrating ability of KAN topologies to exploit reconfigurable nonlinear physical dynamics.
  We experimentally realise physical KANs in silicon-on-insulator devices we term 'Synaptic Nonlinear Elements' (SYNEs), operating at room temperature, 0.1-1 microampere currents, and 2 MHz speeds with no observed degradation over 10^13 measurements and months-long timescales.
  We demonstrate nonlinear function regression, classification, and prediction of Li-Ion battery dynamics from noisy real-world multi-sensor data. Physical KANs outperform equivalently-parameterised software multilayer perceptron networks across all tasks, with up to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters, and two orders of magnitude fewer devices than linear weight based physical networks. These results establish learned physical nonlinearity as a hardware-native computational primitive for compact and efficient learning systems, and SYNE devices as effective substrates for heterogenous nonlinear computing.</description>

      <title>{\sigma}h-Broken Induced Topological quasi-BIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Tunable Band Gap in Commensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bernal bilayer graphene exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the infrared with an electric field. We show that sublattice odd commensurate twisted bilayer graphene (C-TBG) exhibits a band gap that is tunable through the terahertz with an electric field. We show that from the perspective of terahertz optics the sublattice odd and even forms of C-TBG are "inflated" versions of Bernal and AA stacked bilayer graphene respectively with energy scales reduced by a factor of 110 for the 21.79 degree commensurate unit cell. This lower energy scale is accompanied by a correspondingly smaller gate voltage, which means that the strong-field regime is more easily accessible than in the Bernal case. Finally, we show that the interlayer coherence energy is a directly accessible experimental quantity through the position of a power-law divergence in the optical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum hall transformer in a quantum point contact over the full range of transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experiment [Cohen et al., Science 382, 542 (2023)] observed a robustly quantized $e^2/2h$ conductance in a quantum point contact between fractional quantum Hall edges (a quantum Hall transformer), which then vanishes at low temperature. While this behavior can be described by a boundary sine gordon (BSG) model derived from electron tunneling, the microscopic motivation for such strong tunneling is unclear. We use an alternative model based on sliding charge density waves and a density inhomogeneity to clarify the BSG description and calculate the conductance over the full range of transmission. Using a perturbative method and a matrix product state calculation, we draw a quantitative connection between the BSG model and the physical quantum Hall system.</description>

      <title>Vestigial Gapless Boson Density Wave Emerging between $\nu = 1/2$ Fractional Chern Insulator and Finite-Momentum Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The roton-triggered charge-density-wave (CDW)is widely studied in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) and fractional Chern insulator (FCI) systems, and there also exist field theoretical and numerical realizations of continuous transition from FCI to superfluid (SF). However, the theory and numerical explorations of the transition between FCI and supersolid (SS) are still lacking. In this work, we study the topological flat-band lattice models with $\nu$ = 1/2 hard-core bosons, where the previous studies have discovered the existence of FCI states and possible direct FCI-SS transitions. While the FCI is robust, we find the direct FCI-SS transition is absent, and there exist more intriguing scenarios. In the case of checkerboard lattice, we find an intermediate gapless CDW state without SF, sandwiched between FCI and SS. This novel state is triggered by the roton instability in FCI and it further continuously brings about the intertwined finite-momentum SF fluctuation when the CDW order is strong enough, eventually transiting into an unconventional finite-momentum SS state. The intermediate gapless CDW state is a vestige from the SS state, since the increasing quantum fluctuation melts only the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type SF order in SS but its (secondary) product -- the CDW order -- survives. On honeycomb lattice, we find no evidence of SS, but discover an interesting sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions, with both solids incompressible. Moreover, in contrast to previous single-roton condensation, this sequence of FCI-Solid I-Solid II transitions is triggered by the softening of multi-roton modes in FCI. Considering the intertwined wave vectors of the CDW orders, Solid I is a vestige of Solid II. Our work provides new horizon not only for the quantum phase transitions in FCI but also for the intertwined orders and gapless states in bosonic systems, which will inspire future studies.</description>

Abstract: Scalable spin qubit devices will likely require long-range qubit interconnects. We propose to create such an interconnect with a resistive topgate. The topgate is positively biased, to form a channel between the two dots; an end-to-end voltage difference across the nanowire results in an electric field that propels the electron from source dot to target dot. The electron is momentum-incoherent, but not necessarily spin-incoherent; we evaluate threats to spin coherence due to spin-orbit coupling, valley physics, and nuclear spin impurities. We find that spin-orbit coupling is the dominant threat, but momentum-space motional narrowing due to frequent scattering partially protects the electron, resulting in characteristic decoherence lengths ~15 mm for plausible parameters.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are arguably taking a leading role in driving the ongoing quantum technological revolution. A detailed knowledge of the microscopic fluctuating electromagnetic properties plays an important role in advancing the circuitry design, testing, and material integration of cutting-edge superconducting quantum electronics. Here we report scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum sensing of local magnetic noise environment of an on- chip superconducting resonator. We find that quasiparticle-induced fluctuating magnetic fields can drive NV spin relaxation, which shows a peak value around the superconducting transition point of niobium at the thermal equilibrium state. External microwave driving at the resonator mode frequency significantly increases the quasiparticle density, leading to enhancement of magnetic noise. We further perform optically detected magnetic resonance measurements to demonstrate quasiparticle magnetic noise mediated off-resonant dipole coupling between the NV center and niobium resonator. Our work reports experimental observation of the Hebel-Slichter peak signature by an external sensor outside of a superconductor. The presented study also highlights the advantages of quantum sensors in investigating miniaturized superconducting devices, providing insights into their future performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</title>

Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinful model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</description>

      <title>Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter in Optically Driven Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside them. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new nonequilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal steplike structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that redshifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this steplike potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is redshifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a dirty superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity that includes all cavity modes, we construct the nonequilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</description>

      <title>Near transform-limited single photons from rapid-thermal annealed quantum dots</title>

Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates, self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure. The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Employing a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer-range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state structure. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</description>

Abstract: Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full quantum mechanical simulations</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Effect of Thermal-Induced Atomic Motion on the Conductance of Copper Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over 20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions, helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs and their metal interconnects.</description>

      <title>Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moir\'e Superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\'e superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moir\'e-engineered 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Interface States and Nonlinear Thermoelectric Performance in Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence and topological nature of interface states (IFs) in N-AGNR/$(N-2)$-AGNR/N-AGNR heterostructure (AGNRH) segments lacking translational symmetry, focusing on their relation to the end states (ESs) of the constituent armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) segments. For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\beta} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\beta$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O &gt; N_C$ or $N_C &gt; N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\cal T}_{GNR}(\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.</description>

      <title>Bound States from Berry Curvature and Chiral Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of exotic superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, we study the two-body problem in electronic bands endowed with Berry curvature and show that it supports chiral, non-$s$-wave bound states with nonzero angular momentum. In the presence of a Fermi sea, these interactions give rise to a chiral pairing problem featuring multiple superconducting phases that break time-reversal symmetry. These phases form a cascade of chiral topological states with different angular momenta, where the order-parameter phase winds by $2\pi m$ around the Fermi surface, with $m = 1,3,5,\ldots$, and the succession of phases is governed by the Berry-curvature flux through the Fermi-sea area, $\Phi = b k_F^2/2$. As $\Phi$ increases, the system undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions between distinct chiral phases, occurring nearly periodically in $\Phi$ with period two. This realizes a quantum-geometry analog of the Little-Parks effect -- oscillations in $T_c$ that provide a clear and experimentally accessible hallmark of chiral superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Weak Electron-Phonon Coupling Is Insufficient to Generate Significant CISS in Two-Terminal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central open question in chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is whether weak electron-phonon coupling in a helical molecular junction can generate a sizable spin polarization in two-terminal transport without invoking additional strong symmetry-breaking ingredients. We address this question by implementing a self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculation for a helical tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions. The electron-phonon self-energies are evaluated self-consistently, and the transport signal is extracted using the standard magnetization-reversal protocol with a spin-polarized analyzer lead. We benchmark a fully self-consistent NEGF within the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) treatment for both global and local electron-phonon couplings against commonly used approximations, including diagonal self-energy schemes. We quantify how the resulting transport regime and spin polarization depend on phonon frequency, coupling strength, bias, temperature, and system size. In contrast to large polarizations and anomalous size trends reported under approximate treatments, the fully self-consistent calculation yields negligible spin polarization, additionally the electron-phonon coupling mainly renormalizes the spectrum, and transport remains quasi-ballistic across the explored parameter range.</description>

      <title>TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-Type and Laughlin-Type Argument for the Quantum Hall Effect in Lattice Fermions with Spiral Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the condition for the occurrence of the integer quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems with interactions, expressed as $\phi\nu-\rho\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $\phi$, $\nu$, and $\rho$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly with redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be systematically controlled by a factor of the system size.</description>

      <title>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current. This distinction between force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the correlation-induced quantum torques and the current shift in the spin Hall effect. This Hall shift leads to a new definition of the transport spin current thereby addressing an open question in spintronics. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description>
