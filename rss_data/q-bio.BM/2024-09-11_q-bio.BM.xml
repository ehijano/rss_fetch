      <title>Syntax-Guided Procedural Synthesis of Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing synthetically accessible molecules and recommending analogs to unsynthesizable molecules are important problems for accelerating molecular discovery. We reconceptualize both problems using ideas from program synthesis. Drawing inspiration from syntax-guided synthesis approaches, we decouple the syntactic skeleton from the semantics of a synthetic tree to create a bilevel framework for reasoning about the combinatorial space of synthesis pathways. Given a molecule we aim to generate analogs for, we iteratively refine its skeletal characteristics via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations over the space of syntactic skeletons. Given a black-box oracle to optimize, we formulate a joint design space over syntactic templates and molecular descriptors and introduce evolutionary algorithms that optimize both syntactic and semantic dimensions synergistically. Our key insight is that once the syntactic skeleton is set, we can amortize over the search complexity of deriving the program's semantics by training policies to fully utilize the fixed horizon Markov Decision Process imposed by the syntactic template. We demonstrate performance advantages of our bilevel framework for synthesizable analog generation and synthesizable molecule design. Notably, our approach offers the user explicit control over the resources required to perform synthesis and biases the design space towards simpler solutions, making it particularly promising for autonomous synthesis platforms.</description>

      <title>AbGPT: De Novo Antibody Design via Generative Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive immune response, largely mediated by B-cell receptors (BCRs), plays a crucial role for effective pathogen neutralization due to its diversity and antigen specificity. Designing BCRs de novo, or from scratch, has been challenging because of their complex structure and diverse binding requirements. Protein language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance in contextualizing and performing various downstream tasks without relying on structural information. However, these models often lack a comprehensive understanding of the entire protein space, which limits their application in antibody design. In this study, we introduce Antibody Generative Pretrained Transformer (AbGPT), a model fine-tuned from a foundational PLM to enable a more informed design of BCR sequences. Using a custom generation and filtering pipeline, AbGPT successfully generated a high-quality library of 15,000 BCR sequences, demonstrating a strong understanding of the intrinsic variability and conserved regions within the antibody repertoire.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Potential Binders: Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion for Denoising DNA-Encoded Libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of drug discovery, DNA-encoded library (DEL) screening technology has emerged as an efficient method for identifying high-affinity compounds. However, DEL screening faces a significant challenge: noise arising from nonspecific interactions within complex biological systems. Neural networks trained on DEL libraries have been employed to extract compound features, aiming to denoise the data and uncover potential binders to the desired therapeutic target. Nevertheless, the inherent structure of DEL, constrained by the limited diversity of building blocks, impacts the performance of compound encoders. Moreover, existing methods only capture compound features at a single level, further limiting the effectiveness of the denoising strategy. To mitigate these issues, we propose a Multimodal Pretraining DEL-Fusion model (MPDF) that enhances encoder capabilities through pretraining and integrates compound features across various scales. We develop pretraining tasks applying contrastive objectives between different compound representations and their text descriptions, enhancing the compound encoders' ability to acquire generic features. Furthermore, we propose a novel DEL-fusion framework that amalgamates compound information at the atomic, submolecular, and molecular levels, as captured by various compound encoders. The synergy of these innovations equips MPDF with enriched, multi-scale features, enabling comprehensive downstream denoising. Evaluated on three DEL datasets, MPDF demonstrates superior performance in data processing and analysis for validation tasks. Notably, MPDF offers novel insights into identifying high-affinity molecules, paving the way for improved DEL utility in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Infer metabolic fluxes from moment differences of mass-weighted concentration distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metabolic pathways are fundamental maps in biochemistry that detail how molecules are transformed through various reactions. The complexity of metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic direction changes over time or after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to accurately infer the metabolic direction changes after different treatments in an experiment. This study introduces a different concept: mass-weighted concentration distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the concentrations of metabolites times their associated molecular weights. By estimating the differences of the location and scale estimates of these distributions, it becomes possible to infer the metabolic direction and magnitude changes without requiring knowledge of the exact chemical structures of these compounds and their related pathways.</description>
