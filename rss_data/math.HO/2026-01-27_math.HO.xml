      <title>Generalizations of the Squircle-Lemniscate Relation and Keplerian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a generalized relationship between the arc length of sinusoidal spirals \(r^n=\cos(n\theta)\) and the area of generalized Lam\'e curves defined by \(x^{2n}+y^{2n}=1\). Building on our previous work connecting the lemniscate to the squircle, we prove an integral identity relating these two curves for any positive integer $n$, which we further generalize to arbitrary positive real exponents and general superellipses. We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\'e curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\'e curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\'e curve. Finally, we introduce policles--a new class of curves generalizing the squircle--and demonstrate a direct geometric mapping between their sectors and the arc lengths of sinusoidal spirals.</description>

      <title>LLAMA LIMA: A Living Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Generative AI on Learning Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of generative AI in mathematics education are rapidly evolving, posing significant challenges for research to keep pace. Research syntheses remain scarce and risk being outdated by the time of publication. To address this issue, we present a Living Meta-Analysis (LIMA) on the effects of generative AI-based interventions for learning mathematics. Following PRISMA-LSR guidelines, we continuously update the literature base, apply a Bayesian multilevel meta-regression model to account for cumulative data, and publish updated versions on a preprint server at regular intervals. This paper reports results from the first version, including 15 studies. The analyses indicate a small positive effect (g = 0.31) with a wide credible interval [0.06, 0.58], reflecting the still limited evidence base.</description>

      <title>Mesoamerican proportional design and astronomical dualities: rational approximations consistent with $\phi$ and $\pi$ in calendrics and architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how ancient Mesoamerican societies integrated mathematical ideas into calendrical design and monumental architecture requires approaches that acknowledge their distinct epistemological frameworks. While explicit textual evidence for concepts such as $\pi$ or the golden ratio $\phi$ is absent, numerical patterns embedded in Mesoamerican calendars, iconography, and ritual architecture reveal a coherent system of proportional reasoning grounded in simple integer ratios. Here we show that the numbers 5 and 8, central to Venus and solar calendrical relations and widely represented in Mesoamerican cosmology, generate rational approximations that reproduce, within known construction tolerances, the geometric relations associated with decagonal layouts. Using high-resolution measurements of the Iguana structure at Guachimontones, we demonstrate that its proportions align with integer ratios consistent with those found in the calendrical system and with the practical geometry of the regular decagon, without requiring knowledge of irrational constants. These findings suggest that Mesoamerican builders employed stable proportional modules that harmonized astronomical cycles, cosmological symbolism, and architectural design. This should not be interpreted as a lack of mathematical sophistication; rather, the material record reveals a distinct mathematical tradition in which number, measure, and cosmology were mutually reinforcing elements of cultural knowledge.</description>

      <title>Role of (periodic as well as aperiodic) tessellations in contemporary composition. The cases of Tesselles sonores and Le Chapeau \`a douze cornes by Marisa Acu\~na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a family of aperiodic monotiles, which includes David Smith's famous Hat, has shaken the field of plane tessellations. Music composers have already utilised the visual representation of plane tilings in their artwork (Tom Johnson through his use of Vuza's canons, talea and color in isorhythmic motets...). Constructions of the Hat from elementary geometric polygons provide a different perspective, for example through the sound transformation of microtonal intervals, as seen in Marisa Acu\~na's piece Le Chapeau \`a douze cornes.</description>
