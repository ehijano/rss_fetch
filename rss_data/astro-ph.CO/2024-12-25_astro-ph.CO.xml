      <title>Gravitational Waves from Particles Produced from Bubble Collisions in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a new source of gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order phase transitions. The collisions of bubbles of the new phase can efficiently produce particles that couple to the background field undergoing the transition, thereby transferring a significant fraction of the released vacuum energy into a distribution of inhomogeneous and dynamic particle populations that persist long after the bubbles have disappeared. We study the GWs produced by such particle distributions, showing that GWs arise from the quadrupolar anisotropy in the radiation emitted from the bubble collisions, and present a semi-analytical calculation of the two-point correlation function for the associated energy distributions. We find that this new contribution can qualitatively modify the overall GW signal from such phase transitions, creating a distinct shift in the spectral slope at low frequencies that could be observed by future GW experiments. It is therefore important to take this new contribution into account for any transition where the background field has significant self-coupling or couplings to other fields that could lead to efficient particle production at bubble collision.</description>

      <title>Search for a gravitational wave background from primordial black hole binaries using data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes, arising from the superposition of compact binary coalescence events. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms, and perform Bayesian parameter inference, investigating different prior distributions of the model parameters. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Determining $H_0$ from distance sum rule combining gamma-ray bursts with observational Hubble data and strong gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-independent bounds on the Hubble constant $H_0$ are important to shed light on cosmological tensions. We work out a model-independent analysis based on the sum rule, which is applied to late- and early-time data catalogs to determine $H_0$. Through the model-independent B\'ezier interpolation of the observational Hubble data (OHD) and assuming a flat universe, we reconstruct the dimensionless distances of the sum rule and apply them to strong lensing data to derive constraints on $H_0$. Next, we extend this method to the high-redshift domain including, in other two separated analyses, gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets from the well-established Amati and Combo correlations. In all three analyses, our findings agree at $1\sigma$ level with the $H_0$ determined from type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and only at $2\sigma$ level with the measurement derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our method evidences that the bounds on $H_0$ are significantly affected by strong lensing data, which favor the local measurement from SNe Ia. Including GRBs causes only a negligible decrease in the value of $H_0$. This may indicate that GRBs can be used to trace the expansion history and, in conjunction with CMB measurements, may heal the Hubble tension and accommodate to the flat $\Lambda$CDM paradigm purported by CMB data.</description>

      <title>Scalar kicks and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scalar field coupled conformally and disformally to matter affects both the linear memory effect for binary systems on hyperbolic orbits, as well as the kick velocity for binaries on bound or unbound orbits. We study these corrections in detail, their order of magnitude, and discuss their detectability. In particular, we find that the disformal interaction does not contribute to the memory effect and the emitted power spectrum at zero frequency. The conformal interaction corrects the GR linear memory and the quadrupole emitted power at zero frequency resulting in a breaking of the GR memory-power spectrum relationship. On the other hand, disformal interactions give rise to a change of momentum for the centre of mass. Hence, measuring both the linear memory effect and the kicks for hyperbolic orbits would give access to the conformal and disformal couplings of nearly massless scalars to matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmology before noon with multiple galaxy populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-future facilities observing the high-redshift universe ($2&lt;z&lt;5$) will have an opportunity to take advantage of "multi-tracer" cosmology by observing multiple tracers of the matter density field: Lyman alpha emitters (LAE), Lyman break galaxies (LBG), and CMB lensing $\kappa$. In this work we use Fisher forecasts to investigate the effect of multi-tracers on next-generation facilities. In agreement with previous work, we show that multiple tracers improve constraints primarily from degeneracy breaking, instead of the traditional intuition of sample variance cancellation. Then, we forecast that for both BBN and CMB primary priors, the addition of lensing and LAEs onto a LBG-only sample will gain 25\% or more in many parameters, with the largest gains being factor of $\sim10$ improvement for $f_{\rm EDE}$. We include a preliminary approach towards modelling the impact of radiative transfer (RT) on forecasts involving LAEs by introducing a simplified model at linear theory level. Our results, albeit preliminary, show that the while RT influences LAE-only forecasts strongly, its effect on composite multi-tracer forecasts are limited.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies Between JWST Observations and Simulations of Quenched Massive Galaxies at $z &gt; 3$: A Comparative Study With IllustrisTNG and ASTRID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered an unexpectedly large population of massive quiescent galaxies at $z&gt;3$. Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 &lt; \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} &lt; 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the local $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that AGN feedback is key in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback at $z &gt; 2.3$, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale. Although these simulations differ in many aspects, making a direct comparison challenging, our findings suggest the need for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. At lower stellar masses, the quenched galaxies have denser local environments than the star-forming galaxies, suggesting that environmental quenching helps quench less massive galaxies. We also study the post-quenching evolution of the high-$z$ massive quiescent galaxies and find that many experience subsequent reactivation of star formation, evolving into primary progenitors of $z=0$ brightest cluster galaxies.</description>
