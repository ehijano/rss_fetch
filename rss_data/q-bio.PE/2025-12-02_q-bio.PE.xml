      <title>Spatial self-organization stabilizes obligate mutualism through pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutualisms are key for structuring ecological communities, but they are sensitive to environmental change and fluctuations in population size. Consequently, how mutualisms achieve stability remains an open question in ecological theory. Motivated by previous results in competitive and predator-prey interactions, we hypothesize that self-organized pattern formation can act as a key stabilizing mechanism of mutualistic interactions. We test this hypothesis using a two-species reaction-diffusion model of a plant-pollinator system that incorporates non-local plant competition and local mutualistic interactions. We first perform a linear stability analysis to determine the conditions under which non-local competition can trigger vegetation pattern formation. We then compute the bifurcation diagrams for both spatial and homogeneous solutions and find that pattern formation enables coexistence at mutualistic strengths below the threshold required in well-mixed populations. This stability gain increases as environmental conditions worsen, because local maxima in vegetation density create the conditions for community persistence despite globally harsh conditions. Moreover, in the strong mutualism limit, the spatial system exhibits multistability between patterned and homogeneous solutions, creating alternative stable configurations that can buffer against fluctuations in population abundance. Spatial self-organization thus stabilizes mutualistic communities through spatial patterns, potentially driving plant-pollinator persistence in stressed environments, including arid ecosystems.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for the Formation of Large Animal Groups: Topological Coordination, Subgroup Merging, and Velocity Inheritance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large animal groups -- bird flocks, fish schools, insect swarms -- are often assumed to form by gradual aggregation of sparsely distributed individuals. Using a mathematically precise framework based on time-varying directed interaction networks, we show that this widely held view is incomplete.
  The theory demonstrates that large moving groups do not arise by slow accumulation; instead, they emerge through the rapid merging of multiple pre-existing subgroups that are simultaneously activated under high-density conditions. The key mechanism is topological: the long-term interaction structure of any moving group contains a single dominant strongly connected component (SCC). This dominant SCC determines the collective velocity -- both speed and direction -- of the entire group.
  When two subgroups encounter one another, the trailing subgroup aligns with -- and ultimately inherits -- the velocity of the dominant SCC of the leading subgroup. Repeated merging events naturally generate large groups whose speed is predicted to be lower than the mean speed of the original subgroups. The same dynamics explain several universal empirical features: broad neighbour-distance distributions, directional asymmetry in neighbour selection, and the characteristic narrow-front, wide-rear geometry of real flocks.
  The framework yields testable predictions for STARFLAG-style 3D datasets, offering a unified explanation for the formation, maintenance, and geometry of coordinated animal groups.</description>

      <title>Network Curvature as a Structural Driver of Dengue Spread: A Bayesian Spatial Analysis of Recife (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the structural connectivity of urban road networks helps explain dengue incidence in Recife, Brazil (2015--2024). For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk. In the BYM2 model, the structured spatial component collapses ($\phi \approx 0$), indicating that functional network connectivity explains nearly all spatial dependence typically attributed to adjacency-based CAR terms. The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</description>

      <title>Adaptation to time-varying environments in a reaction-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spatially-extended system of chemical reactions exhibiting adaptation to time-dependent influxes of reactants. Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles.</description>

      <title>Existence of two thresholds in a bistable equation with nonlocal competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal bistable reaction-diffusion equation, which serves as a model for a population structured by a phenotypic trait, subject to mutation, trait-dependent fitness, and nonlocal competition. Within this replicator-mutator framework, we further incorporate a ''pseudo-Allee effect'' so that the long time behavior (extinction vs. survival) depends on the size of the initial data. After proving the well-posedness of the associated Cauchy problem, we investigate its long-time behavior. We first show that small initial data lead to extinction. More surprisingly, we then prove that that extinction may also occur for too large initial data, in particular when selection is not strong enough. Finally, we exhibit situations where intermediate initial data lead to persistence, thereby revealing the existence of (at least) two thresholds. These results stand in sharp contrast with the behavior observed in local bistable equations.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of temperature and bird migration on the spread of West Nile virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: West Nile virus (WNV) is a climate-sensitive mosquito-borne arbovirus circulating between mosquitoes of the genus Culex and birds, with a potential spillover to humans and other mammals. Recent trends in climatic change, characterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures, and above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe, including Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of a system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept of diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent parameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality rate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts across space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory birds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has non-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical simulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany (2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement with the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed spreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly driven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and vectors. Only during the year 2023, the additional inclusion of advection for migratory birds was important to correctly predict new hotspots in new locations in Germany.</description>
