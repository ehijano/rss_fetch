      <title>Multi-IRS-aided Terahertz Networks: Channel Modelling and User Association With Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is envisioned as one of the candidate technologies for future wireless communications to enable achievable data rates of up to several terabits per second (Tbps). However, the high pathloss and molecular absorption in THz band communications often limit the transmission range. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS)-aided THz networks with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Specifically, we present an angle-based trigonometric channel model to facilitate the performance evaluation of IRS-aided THz networks. In addition, to maximize the sum rate, we formulate the transmitter (Tx)-IRS-receiver (Rx) matching problem, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To address this non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, we propose a Gale-Shapley algorithm-based solutions to obtain stable matching between transmitters and IRSs, and receivers and IRSs, in the first and second sub-problems, respectively. The impact of the transmission power, the number of IRS elements, and the network area on the sum rate are investigated. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared to an exhaustive search, nearest association, greedy search, and random allocation to validate the proposed solution. The complexity and convergence analysis demonstrate that the computational complexity of our algorithm is lower than that of the ES method.</description>

      <title>Value Prediction for Spatiotemporal Gait Data Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human gait has been commonly used for the diagnosis and evaluation of medical conditions and for monitoring the progress during treatment and rehabilitation. The use of wearable sensors that capture pressure or motion has yielded techniques that analyze the gait data to aid recovery, identify activity performed, or identify individuals. Deep learning, usually employing classification, has been successfully utilized in a variety of applications such as computer vision, biomedical imaging analysis, and natural language processing. We expand the application of deep learning to value prediction of time-series of spatiotemporal gait data. Moreover, we explore several deep learning architectures (Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and RNN combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)) to make short- and long-distance predictions using two different experimental setups. Our results show that short-distance prediction has an RMSE as low as 0.060675, and long-distance prediction RMSE as low as 0.106365. Additionally, the results show that the proposed deep learning models are capable of predicting the entire trial when trained and validated using the trials from the same participant. The proposed, customized models, used with value prediction open possibilities for additional applications, such as fall prediction, in-home progress monitoring, aiding of exoskeleton movement, and authentication.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing Framework in Efficient Channel State Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquiring downlink channel state information (CSI) at the base station is vital for optimizing performance in massive Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD) systems. While deep learning architectures have been successful in facilitating UE-side CSI feedback and gNB-side recovery, the undersampling issue prior to CSI feedback is often overlooked. This issue, which arises from low density pilot placement in current standards, results in significant aliasing effects in outdoor channels and consequently limits CSI recovery performance. To this end, this work introduces a new CSI upsampling framework at the gNB as a post-processing solution to address the gaps caused by undersampling. Leveraging the physical principles of discrete Fourier transform shifting theorem and multipath reciprocity, our framework effectively uses uplink CSI to mitigate aliasing effects. We further develop a learning-based method that integrates the proposed algorithm with the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm Net (ISTA-Net) architecture, enhancing our approach for non-uniform sampling recovery. Our numerical results show that both our rule-based and deep learning methods significantly outperform traditional interpolation techniques and current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Automotive Radar Sensing via Mixed-Precision Distributed Array Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of coarse quantization with mixed precision on measurements obtained from sparse linear arrays, synthesized by a collaborative automotive radar sensing strategy. The mixed quantization precision significantly reduces the data amount that needs to be shared from radar nodes to the fusion center for coherent processing. We utilize the low-rank properties inherent in the constructed Hankel matrix of the mixed-precision array, to recover azimuth angles from quantized measurements. Our proposed approach addresses the challenge of mixed-quantized Hankel matrix completion, allowing for accurate estimation of the azimuth angles of interest. To evaluate the recovery performance of the proposed scheme, we establish a quasi-isometric embedding with a high probability for mixed-precision quantization. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical results, highlighting successful reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Sparse Bayesian Learning-Based Hierarchical Construction for 3D Radio Environment Maps Incorporating Channel Shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio environment map (REM) visually displays the spectrum information over the geographical map and plays a significant role in monitoring, management, and security of spectrum resources.In this paper, we present an efficient 3D REM construction scheme based on the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), which aims to recovery the accurate REM with limited and optimized sampling data.In order to reduce the number of sampling sensors, an efficient sparse sampling method for unknown scenarios is proposed. For the given construction accuracy and the priority of each location, the quantity and sampling locations can be jointly optimized.With the sparse sampled data, by mining the spectrum situation sparsity and channel propagation characteristics, an SBL-based spectrum data hierarchical recovery algorithm is developed to estimate the missing data of unsampled locations.Finally, the simulated 3D REM data in the campus scenario are used to verify the proposed methods as well as to compare with the state-of-the-art. We also analyze the recovery performance and the impact of different parameters on the constructed REMs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can ensure the construction accuracy and improve the computational efficiency under the low sampling rate.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Beam Selection and Precoding Design for Coordinated Multiple-Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a joint optimization framework for user-centric beam selection and linear precoding (LP) design in a coordinated multiple-satellite (CoMSat) system, employing a Digital-Fourier-Transform-based (DFT) beamforming (BF) technique. Regarding serving users at their target SINRs and minimizing the total transmit power, the scheme aims to efficiently determine satellites for users to associate with and activate the best cluster of beams together with optimizing LP for every satellite-to-user transmission. These technical objectives are first framed as a complex mixed-integer programming (MIP) challenge. To tackle this, we reformulate it into a joint cluster association and LP design problem. Then, by theoretically analyzing the duality relationship between downlink and uplink transmissions, we develop an efficient iterative method to identify the optimal solution. Additionally, a simpler duality approach for rapid beam selection and LP design is presented for comparison purposes. Simulation results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed schemes across various settings.</description>

      <title>Sensor Network Localization via Riemannian Conjugate Gradient and Rank Reduction: An Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the Sensor Network Localization (SNL) problem using received signal strength. The SNL is formulated as an Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem under the unit ball sample model. Using the Burer-Monteiro factorization type cost function, the EDMC is solved by Riemannian conjugate gradient with Hager-Zhang line search method on a quotient manifold. A "rank reduction" preprocess is proposed for proper initialization and to achieve global convergence with high probability. Simulations on a synthetic scene show that our approach attains better localization accuracy and is computationally efficient compared to several baseline methods. Characterization of a small local basin of attraction around the global optima of the s-stress function under Bernoulli sampling rule and incoherence matrix completion framework is conducted for the first time. Theoretical result conjectures that the Euclidean distance problem with a structure-less sample mask can be effectively handled using spectral initialization followed by vanilla first-order methods. This preliminary analysis, along with the aforementioned numerical accomplishments, provides insights into revealing the landscape of the s-stress function and may stimulate the design of simpler algorithms to tackle the non-convex formulation of general EDMC problems.</description>

      <title>3D Spectrum Mapping and Reconstruction under Multi-Radiation Source Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrum map construction, which is crucial in cognitive radio (CR) system, visualizes the invisible space of the electromagnetic spectrum for spectrum-resource management and allocation. Traditional reconstruction methods are generally for two-dimensional (2D) spectrum map and driven by abundant sampling data. In this paper, we propose a data-model-knowledge-driven reconstruction scheme to construct the three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map under multi-radiation source scenarios. We firstly design a maximum and minimum path loss difference (MMPLD) clustering algorithm to detect the number of radiation sources in a 3D space. Then, we develop a joint location-power estimation method based on the heuristic population evolutionary optimization algorithm. Considering the variation of electromagnetic environment, we self-learn the path loss (PL) model based on the sampling data. Finally, the 3D spectrum is reconstructed according to the self-learned PL model and the extracted knowledge of radiation sources. Simulations show that the proposed 3D spectrum map reconstruction scheme not only has splendid adaptability to the environment, but also achieves high spectrum construction accuracy even when the sampling rate is very low.</description>

      <title>Distributed Deep Learning for Modulation Classification in 6G Cell-Free Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the evolution of 6th Generation (6G) technology, the emergence of cell-free networking presents a paradigm shift, revolutionizing user experiences within densely deployed networks where distributed access points collaborate. However, the integration of intelligent mechanisms is crucial for optimizing the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of these 6G cell-free networks. One application aiming to optimize spectrum usage is Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), a vital component for classifying and dynamically adjusting modulation schemes. This paper explores different distributed solutions for AMC in cell-free networks, addressing the training, computational complexity, and accuracy of two practical approaches. The first approach addresses scenarios where signal sharing is not feasible due to privacy concerns or fronthaul limitations. Our findings reveal that maintaining comparable accuracy is remarkably achievable, yet it comes with an increase in computational demand. The second approach considers a central model and multiple distributed models collaboratively classifying the modulation. This hybrid model leverages diversity gain through signal combining and requires synchronization and signal sharing. The hybrid model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a 2.5% improvement in accuracy with equivalent total computational load. Notably, the hybrid model distributes the computational load across multiple devices, resulting in a lower individual computational load.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning based Positioning with Multi-task Learning and Uncertainty-based Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have been shown to improve the performance of several use cases for the fifth-generation (5G) New radio (NR) air interface. In this paper we investigate user equipment (UE) positioning using the channel state information (CSI) fingerprints between a UE and multiple base stations (BSs). In such a setup, a single DL model can be trained for UE positioning using the CSI fingerprints of the multiple BSs as input. Alternatively, based on the CSI at each BS, a separate DL model can be trained at each BS and then the output of the different models are combined to determine the UE's position. In this work we compare these different fusion techniques and show that fusing the output of separate models achieves higher positioning accuracy, especially in a dynamic scenario. We also show that the fusion of multiple outputs further benefits from considering the uncertainty of the output of the DL model at each BS. For a more efficient training of the DL model across BSs, we additionally propose a multi-task learning (MTL) scheme by sharing some parameters across the models while jointly training all models. This method, not only improves the accuracy of the individual models, but also of the final combined estimate. Lastly, we evaluate the reliability of the uncertainty estimation to ascertain which of the fusion methods provides the highest quality of uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Adaptive Algorithm for Non-Smooth Spatial Filtering Problems in Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wireless sensor network often relies on a fusion center to process the data collected by each of its sensing nodes. Such an approach relies on the continuous transmission of raw data to the fusion center, which typically has a major impact on the sensors' battery life. To address this issue in the particular context of spatial filtering and signal fusion problems, we recently proposed the Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) algorithm, which distributively computes a spatial filter expressed as the solution of a smooth optimization problem involving the network-wide sensor signal statistics. In this work, we show that the DASF algorithm can be extended to compute the filters associated with a certain class of non-smooth optimization problems. This extension makes the addition of sparsity-inducing norms to the problem's cost function possible, allowing sensor selection to be performed in a distributed fashion, alongside the filtering task of interest, thereby further reducing the network's energy consumption. We provide a description of the algorithm, prove its convergence, and validate its performance and solution tracking capabilities with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Covariance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the use of deep learning for covariance estimation. We propose to globally learn a neural network that will then be applied locally at inference time. Leveraging recent advancements in self-supervised foundational models, we train the network without any labeling by simply masking different samples and learning to predict their covariance given their surrounding neighbors. The architecture is based on the popular attention mechanism. Its main advantage over classical methods is the automatic exploitation of global characteristics without any distributional assumptions or regularization. It can be pre-trained as a foundation model and then be repurposed for various downstream tasks, e.g., adaptive target detection in radar or hyperspectral imagery.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on the latest research and innovations in fundamental next-generation multiple access (NGMA) techniques and the coexistence with other key technologies for the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks. In more detail, we first examine multi-access edge computing (MEC), which is critical to meeting the growing demand for data processing and computational capacity at the edge of the network, as well as network slicing. We then explore over-the-air (OTA) computing, which is considered to be an approach that provides fast and efficient computation of various functions. We also explore semantic communications, identified as an effective way to improve communication systems by focusing on the exchange of meaningful information, thus minimizing unnecessary data and increasing efficiency. The interrelationship between machine learning (ML) and multiple access technologies is also reviewed, with an emphasis on federated learning, federated distillation, split learning, reinforcement learning, and the development of ML-based multiple access protocols. Finally, the concept of digital twinning and its role in network management is discussed, highlighting how virtual replication of physical networks can lead to improvements in network efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cycling power measurement is an indispensable metric with profound implications for cyclists' performance and fitness levels. It empowers riders with real-time feedback, supports precise training regimen planning, mitigates injury risks, and enhances muscular development. Despite these advantages, the widespread adoption of cycling power meters has been hampered by their prohibitive cost and deployment complexity. This paper pioneers a groundbreaking approach to power measurement in cycling, prioritizing affordability and user-friendliness. To achieve this goal, we introduce a cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) device that seamlessly integrates force signals with inertial sensor data while leveraging the power of edge machine learning techniques. In-field experimental evaluations demonstrate that our prototype can estimate power with remarkable accuracy, boasting a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of only 12.29 Watts (4.1\%). Notably, our design emphasizes energy efficiency, operating in a low-power mode that consumes a mere 50 milliwatts and offers an exceptional battery life of up to 25.8 hours in always-on active mode. With an ultra-low latency of 4.33 milliseconds for data processing and inference, our system ensures real-time power estimation during cycling activities. Incorporating IoT concepts and devices, this paper marks a significant milestone in developing cost-effective and accurate cycling power meters.</description>

      <title>Freshness-aware Resource Allocation for Non-orthogonal Wireless-powered IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a wireless-powered Internet of Things (IoT) network comprising a hybrid access point (HAP) and two devices. The HAP facilitates downlink wireless energy transfer (WET) for device charging and uplink wireless information transfer (WIT) to collect status updates from the devices. To keep the information fresh, concurrent WET and WIT are allowed, and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are adaptively scheduled for WIT. Consequently, we formulate an expected weighted sum age of information (EWSAoI) minimization problem to adaptively schedule the transmission scheme, choosing from WET, OMA, NOMA, and WET+OMA, and to allocate transmit power. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and develop an optimal policy based on instantaneous AoI and remaining battery power to determine scheme selection and transmit power allocation. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy, and the optimal policy has a distinct decision boundary-switching property, providing valuable insights for practical system design.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known as spectral graph filters, find a wide range of applications in web networks. To bypass eigendecomposition, polynomial graph filters are proposed to approximate graph filters by leveraging various polynomial bases for filter training. However, no existing studies have explored the diverse polynomial graph filters from a unified perspective for optimization.
  In this paper, we first unify polynomial graph filters, as well as the optimal filters of identical degrees into the Krylov subspace of the same order, thus providing equivalent expressive power theoretically. Next, we investigate the asymptotic convergence property of polynomials from the unified Krylov subspace perspective, revealing their limited adaptability in graphs with varying heterophily degrees. Inspired by those facts, we design a novel adaptive Krylov subspace approach to optimize polynomial bases with provable controllability over the graph spectrum so as to adapt various heterophily graphs. Subsequently, we propose AdaptKry, an optimized polynomial graph filter utilizing bases from the adaptive Krylov subspaces. Meanwhile, in light of the diverse spectral properties of complex graphs, we extend AdaptKry by leveraging multiple adaptive Krylov bases without incurring extra training costs. As a consequence, extended AdaptKry is able to capture the intricate characteristics of graphs and provide insights into their inherent complexity. We conduct extensive experiments across a series of real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superior filtering capability of AdaptKry, as well as the optimized efficacy of the adaptive Krylov basis.</description>

      <title>Minimal-Ambiguity Scattering Matrix Estimation with Load-Tunable Ports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the following generic wave problem: is the estimation of an arbitrarily complex linear $N$-port system's scattering matrix possible if waves can be input and output only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ ports are terminated with tunable loads? Fundamentally, this problem is intriguing because it ultimately probes to what extent inherent structure in Maxwell's equations constrains the scattering coefficients. Various limited versions of the problem are of temporary scientific and technological interest, ranging from optimal non-invasive focusing on perturbation-inducing targets in complex media, via the characterization of miniaturized, embedded, receive-only and/or multi-element antenna systems to physics-compliant end-to-end channel models for complex metasurface-programmable "smart radio environments". More generally, solutions to the problem may yield promising measurement techniques to characterize an arbitrary linear $N$-port system with an $N_\mathrm{A}$-port measurement device, where $N_\mathrm{A} \ll N$. We show theoretically that if $N_\mathrm{A}\geq 2$ and at least three distinct tunable loads are available, the problem can be solved except for sign ambiguities on the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports. If the transmission from at least one accessible port to the NDA ports can be measured, the sign ambiguity can be lifted. We corroborate our results with microwave experiments on an 8-port chaotic cavity with $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$. Moreover, we reveal additional constraining structure in Maxwell's equations by showing that a limitation to phase-insensitive measurements only results in a mild additional blockwise phase ambiguity that can be lifted simultaneously with the sign ambiguity.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Based on User Distribution: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional (6D) movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna/two-dimensional (2D) movable antenna (FA/2DMA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennas' movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS can significantly improve the network capacity as compared to the benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or MAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Different Optimization Strategies to Physics-Constrained Deep Learning for Soil Moisture Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil moisture is a key hydrological parameter that has significant importance to human society and the environment. Accurate modeling and monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields, especially in the root zone (top 100 cm of soil), is essential for improving agricultural production and crop yield with the help of precision irrigation and farming tools. Realizing the full sensor data potential depends greatly on advanced analytical and predictive domain-aware models. In this work, we propose a physics-constrained deep learning (P-DL) framework to integrate physics-based principles on water transport and water sensing signals for effective reconstruction of the soil moisture dynamics. We adopt three different optimizers, namely Adam, RMSprop, and GD, to minimize the loss function of P-DL during the training process. In the illustrative case study, we demonstrate the empirical convergence of Adam optimizers outperforms the other optimization methods in both mini-batch and full-batch training.</description>

      <title>Prototyping and Experimental Results for Environment-Aware Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment via Channel Knowledge Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM), which aims to directly reflect the intrinsic channel properties of the local wireless environment, is a novel technique for achieving environmentaware communication. In this paper, to alleviate the large training overhead in millimeter wave (mmWave) beam alignment, an environment-aware and training-free beam alignment prototype is established based on a typical CKM, termed beam index map (BIM). To this end, a general CKM construction method is first presented, and an indoor BIM is constructed offline to learn the candidate transmit and receive beam index pairs for each grid in the experimental area. Furthermore, based on the location information of the receiver (or the dynamic obstacles) from the ultra-wide band (UWB) positioning system, the established BIM is used to achieve training-free beam alignment by directly providing the beam indexes for the transmitter and receiver. Three typical scenarios are considered in the experiment, including quasi-static environment with line-of-sight (LoS) link, quasistatic environment without LoS link and dynamic environment. Besides, the receiver orientation measured from the gyroscope is also used to help CKM predict more accurate beam indexes. The experiment results show that compared with the benchmark location-based beam alignment strategy, the CKM-based beam alignment strategy can achieve much higher received power, which is close to that achieved by exhaustive beam search, but with significantly reduced training overhead.</description>

      <title>From Channel Measurement to Training Data for PHY Layer AI Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play an increasingly important role in the development of future communication networks. The success of a learning algorithm depends on the quality and quantity of the available training data. In the physical layer (PHY), channel information data can be obtained either through measurement campaigns or through simulations based on predefined channel models. Performing measurements can be time consuming while only gaining information about one specific position or scenario. Simulated data, on the other hand, are more generalized and reflect in most cases not a real environment but instead, a statistical approximation based on a mathematical model. This paper presents a procedure for acquiring channel data by means of fast and flexible software defined radio (SDR) based channel measurements along with a method for a parameter extraction that provides configuration input to the simulator. The procedure from the measurement to the simulated channel data is demonstrated in two exemplary propagation scenarios. It is shown, that in both cases the simulated data is in good accordance to the measurements</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Beam Training for Multi-RIS-Assisted Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the beam training problem in the multi-user millimeter wave (mmWave) communication system, where multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are deployed to improve the coverage and the achievable rate. However, existing beam training techniques in mmWave systems suffer from the high complexity (i.e., exponential order) and low identification accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme that reduces the training complexity to the logarithmic order with the high accuracy. Specifically, we first design a generation mechanism for HMB codebooks. Then, we propose a demultiplexing algorithm based on the soft decision to distinguish signals from different RIS reflective links. Finally, we utilize a multi-round voting mechanism to align the beams. Simulation results show that the proposed HMB training scheme enables simultaneous training for multiple RISs and multiple users, and reduces the beam training overhead to the logarithmic level. Moreover, it also shows that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the identification accuracy by at least 20% compared to existing beam training techniques.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Rate Analysis for Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal technology for next-generation cellular networks, offering mutual benefits in both sensing and communication capabilities. This advancement necessitates a re-examination of the fundamental limits within networks where these two functions coexist via shared spectrum and infrastructures. However, traditional stochastic geometry-based performance analyses are confined to either communication or sensing networks separately. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a generalized stochastic geometry framework in ISAC networks. Based on this framework, we define and calculate the coverage and ergodic rate of sensing and communication performance under resource constraints. Then, we shed light on the fundamental limits of ISAC networks by presenting theoretical results for the coverage rate of the unified performance, taking into account the coupling effects of dual functions in coexistence networks. Further, we obtain the analytical formulations for evaluating the ergodic sensing rate constrained by the maximum communication rate, and the ergodic communication rate constrained by the maximum sensing rate. Extensive numerical results validate the accuracy of all theoretical derivations, and also indicate that denser networks significantly enhance ISAC coverage. Specifically, increasing the base station density from $1$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ to $10$ $\text{km}^{-2}$ can boost the ISAC coverage rate from $1.4\%$ to $39.8\%$. Further, results also reveal that with the increase of the constrained sensing rate, the ergodic communication rate improves significantly, but the reverse is not obvious.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Compression with Learned Heegard-Berger Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider lossy compression of an information source when decoder-only side information may be absent. This setup, also referred to as the Heegard-Berger or Kaspi problem, is a special case of robust distributed source coding. Building upon previous works on neural network-based distributed compressors developed for the decoder-only side information (Wyner-Ziv) case, we propose learning-based schemes that are amenable to the availability of side information. We find that our learned compressors mimic the achievability part of the Heegard-Berger theorem and yield interpretable results operating close to information-theoretic bounds. Depending on the availability of the side information, our neural compressors recover characteristics of the point-to-point (i.e., with no side information) and the Wyner-Ziv coding strategies that include binning in the source space, although no structure exploiting knowledge of the source and side information was imposed into the design.</description>

      <title>Meta Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in Aerial Active-RIS-assisted Networks with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mounting a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) holds promise for improving traditional terrestrial network performance. Unlike conventional methods deploying passive RIS on UAVs, this study delves into the efficacy of an aerial active RIS (AARIS). Specifically, the downlink transmission of an AARIS network is investigated, where the base station (BS) leverages rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for effective interference management and benefits from the support of an AARIS for jointly amplifying and reflecting the BS's transmit signals. Considering both the non-trivial energy consumption of the active RIS and the limited energy storage of the UAV, we propose an innovative element selection strategy for optimizing the on/off status of RIS elements, which adaptively and remarkably manages the system's power consumption. To this end, a resource management problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS, the element activation, the phase shift and the amplification factor at the RIS, the RSMA common data rate at users, as well as the UAV's trajectory. Due to the dynamicity nature of UAV and user mobility, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for resource allocation, utilizing meta-learning to adaptively handle fast time-varying system dynamics. Simulations indicate that incorporating an active RIS at the UAV leads to substantial EE gain, compared to passive RIS-aided UAV. We observe the superiority of the RSMA-based AARIS system in terms of EE, compared to existing approaches adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency sonar systems deployed on a wide array of ocean observing platforms are creating a deluge of water column sonar data at an unprecedented speed from all corners of the ocean. Efficient and integrative analysis of these data, either across different sonar instruments or with other oceanographic datasets, holds the key to understanding the response of marine ecosystems to the rapidly changing climate. Here we present Echopype, an open-source Python software library designed to address this need. By standardizing water column sonar data from diverse instruments following a community convention and utilizing the widely embraced netCDF data model to encode sonar data as labeled, multi-dimensional arrays, Echopype facilitates intuitive, user-friendly exploration and use of sonar data in an instrument-agnostic manner. By leveraging existing open-source Python libraries optimized for distributed computing, Echopype directly enables computational interoperability and scalability in both local and cloud computing environments. Echopype's modularized package structure further provides a conceptually unified implementation framework for expanding its support for additional instrument raw data formats and incorporating new data analysis functionalities. We envision the continued development of Echopype as a catalyst for making information derived from water column sonar data an integrated component of regional and global ocean observation strategies.</description>

Abstract: Tracking climbers' activity to improve services and make the best use of their infrastructure is a concern for climbing gyms. Each climbing session must be analyzed from beginning till lowering of the climber. Therefore, spotting the climbers descending is crucial since it indicates when the ascent has come to an end. This problem must be addressed while preserving privacy and convenience of the climbers and the costs of the gyms. To this aim, a hardware prototype is developed to collect data using accelerometer sensors attached to a piece of climbing equipment mounted on the wall, called quickdraw, that connects the climbing rope to the bolt anchors. The corresponding sensors are configured to be energy-efficient, hence become practical in terms of expenses and time consumption for replacement when using in large quantity in a climbing gym. This paper describes hardware specifications, studies data measured by the sensors in ultra-low power mode, detect sensors' orientation patterns during lowering different routes, and develop an supervised approach to identify lowering.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint optimization framework for energy-efficient linear precoding and feeder-link-beam matching design in a multi-gateway multi-beam bent-pipe satellite communication system. The proposed scheme jointly optimizes the precoding vectors at the gateway antennas and amplifying-and-matching mechanism at the satellite to maximize the system-weighted energy efficiency under the transmit power budget constraint. The technical designs are formulated into a non-convex sparsity problem consisting of a fractional-form objective function and sparsity-related constraints. To address these challenges, two iterative efficient designs are proposed by utilizing the concepts of Dinkelbach's method and the compressed-sensing approach. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to another benchmark method.</description>

Abstract: We present a real-time visualization system for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique for treating various brain disorders and mental health diseases. Our solution targets the current challenges of slow and labor-intensive practices in treatment planning. Integrating Deep Learning (DL), our system rapidly predicts electric field (E-field) distributions in 0.2 seconds for precise and effective brain stimulation. The core advancement lies in our tool's real-time neuronavigation visualization capabilities, which support clinicians in making more informed decisions quickly and effectively. We assess our system's performance through three studies: First, a real-world use case scenario in a clinical setting, providing concrete feedback on applicability and usability in a practical environment. Second, a comparative analysis with another TMS tool focusing on computational efficiency across various hardware platforms. Lastly, we conducted an expert user study to measure usability and influence in optimizing TMS treatment planning. The system is openly available for community use and further development on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/lorifranke/SlicerTMS}.</description>

      <title>OTFS based Joint Radar and Communication: Signal Analysis using the Ambiguity Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently been identified as a suitable waveform for joint radar and communication systems. Focusing on the effect of data modulation on the radar sensing performance, we derive the ambiguity function (AF) of the OTFS waveform and characterize the radar global accuracy. We evaluate the behavior of the AF with respect to the distribution of the modulated data and derive an accurate approximation for the mean and variance of the AF, thus, approximating its distribution by a Rice distribution. Finally, we evaluate the global radar performance of the OTFS waveform with the OFDM waveform.</description>

      <title>BICM-compatible Rate Adaptive Geometric Constellation Shaping Using Optimized Many-to-one Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a rate adaptive geometric constellation shaping (GCS) scheme which is fully backward-compatible with existing state of the art bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The system relies on optimization of the positions of the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) points on the I/Q plane for maximized achievable information rate, while maintaining quantization and fiber nonlinear noise robustness. Furthermore, `dummy' bits are multiplexed with coded bits before mapping to symbols. Rate adaptivity is achieved by tuning the ratio of coded and `dummy' bits, while maintaining a fixed forward error-correction block and a fixed modulation format size. The points' positions and their labeling are optimized using automatic differentiation. The proposed GCS scheme is compared to a time-sharing hybrid (TH) QAM modulation and the now mainstream probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) scheme. The TH without shaping is outperformed for all studied data rates in a simulated linear channel by up to 0.7 dB. In a linear channel, PAS is shown to outperform the proposed GCS scheme, while similar performances are reported for PAS and the proposed GCS in a simulated nonlinear fiber channel. The GCS scheme is experimentally demonstrated in a multi-span recirculating loop coherent optical fiber transmission system with a total distance of up to 3000 km. Near-continuous zero-error flexible throughput is reported as a function of the transmission distance. Up to 1-2 spans of increased reach gains are achieved at the same net data rate w.r.t. conventional QAM. At a given distance, up to 0.79 bits/2D symbol of gain w.r.t. conventional QAM is achieved. In the experiment, similar performance to PAS is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Microwave lymphedema assessment using deep learning with contour assisted backprojection</title>

Abstract: We present a method for early detection of lymphatic fluid accumulation in lymphedema patients based on microwave imaging of the limb volume across an air gap. The proposed algorithm uses contour information of the imaged limb surface to approximate the wave propagation velocity locally to solve the eikonal equation for implementing the adjoint imaging operator. This modified backprojection algorithm results in focused imagery close to the limb surface where lymphatic fluid accumulation presents itself. Next, a deep neural network based on U-Net architecture is employed to identify the location and extent of the lymphatic fluid. Simulation studies with various upper and lower arm profiles compare the focusing performance of the proposed contour assisted backprojection imaging with the baseline imaging approach that assumes homogeneous media. The empirical results of the simulation experiments show that the proposed imaging method significantly improves the ability of the deepnet model to identify the location and the volume of the excess fluid in the limb.</description>

      <title>High-speed Low-consumption sEMG-based Transient-state micro-Gesture Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gesture recognition on wearable devices is extensively applied in human-computer interaction. Electromyography (EMG) has been used in many gesture recognition systems for its rapid perception of muscle signals. However, analyzing EMG signals on devices, like smart wristbands, usually needs inference models to have high performances, such as low inference latency, low power consumption, and low memory occupation. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved spiking neural network (SNN) to achieve these goals. We propose an adaptive multi-delta coding as a spiking coding method to improve recognition accuracy. We propose two additive solvers for SNN, which can reduce inference energy consumption and amount of parameters significantly, and improve the robustness of temporal differences. In addition, we propose a linear action detection method TAD-LIF, which is suitable for SNNs. TAD-LIF is an improved LIF neuron that can detect transient-state gestures quickly and accurately. We collected two datasets from 20 subjects including 6 micro gestures. The collection devices are two designed lightweight consumer-level sEMG wristbands (3 and 8 electrode channels respectively). Compared to CNN, FCN, and normal SNN-based methods, the proposed SNN has higher recognition accuracy. The accuracy of the proposed SNN is 83.85% and 93.52% on the two datasets respectively. In addition, the inference latency of the proposed SNN is about 1% of CNN, the power consumption is about 0.1% of CNN, and the memory occupation is about 20% of CNN. The proposed methods can be used for precise, high-speed, and low-power micro-gesture recognition tasks, and are suitable for consumer-level intelligent wearable devices, which is a general way to achieve ubiquitous computing.</description>

      <title>Vector Quantization for Deep-Learning-Based CSI Feedback in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a finite-rate deep-learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback method for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The presented method provides a finite-bit representation of the latent vector based on a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework while reducing its computational complexity based on shape-gain vector quantization. In this method, the magnitude of the latent vector is quantized using a non-uniform scalar codebook with a proper transformation function, while the direction of the latent vector is quantized using a trainable Grassmannian codebook. A multi-rate codebook design strategy is also developed by introducing a codeword selection rule for a nested codebook along with the design of a loss function. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the computational complexity associated with VQ-VAE while improving CSI reconstruction performance under a given feedback overhead.</description>

      <title>Flexible K Nearest Neighbors Classifier: Derivation and Application for Ion-mobility Spectrometry-based Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is widely used in many fields such as fingerprint-based localization or medicine. It determines the class membership of unlabelled sample based on the class memberships of the K labelled samples, the so-called nearest neighbors, that are closest to the unlabelled sample. The choice of K has been the topic of various studies and proposed KNN-variants. Yet no variant has been proven to outperform all other variants. In this paper a KNN-variant is discussed which ensures that the K nearest neighbors are indeed close to the unlabelled sample and finds K along the way. The algorithm is tested and compared to the standard KNN in theoretical scenarios and for indoor localization based on ion-mobility spectrometry fingerprints. It achieves a higher classification accuracy than the KNN in the tests, while having the same computational demand.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Detection in Noncoherent Massive SIMO Systems over Correlated Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the goal of enabling ultrareliable and low-latency wireless communications for industrial internet of things (IIoT), this paper studies the use of energy-based modulations in noncoherent massive single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems. We consider a one-shot communication over a channel with correlated Rayleigh fading and colored Gaussian noise, in which the receiver has statistical channel state information (CSI). We first provide a theoretical analysis on the limitations of unipolar pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) in systems of this kind, based on maximum likelihood detection. The existence of a fundamental error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes is proved for constellations with more than two energy levels, when no (statistical) CSI is available at the transmitter. In the main body of the paper, we present a design framework for quadratic detectors that generalizes the widely-used energy detector, to better exploit the statistical knowledge of the channel. This allows us to design receivers optimized according to information-theoretic criteria that exhibit lower error rates at moderate and high SNR. We subsequently derive an analytic approximation for the error probability of a general class of quadratic detectors in the large array regime. Finally, we numerically validate it and discuss the outage probability of the system.</description>

      <title>Electrocardiogram Instruction Tuning for Report Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) serves as the primary non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiac conditions monitoring, are crucial in assisting clinicians. Recent studies have concentrated on classifying cardiac conditions using ECG data but have overlooked ECG report generation, which is not only time-consuming but also requires clinical expertise. To automate ECG report generation and ensure its versatility, we propose the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework, the \textit{first} attempt to tackle ECG report generation with LLMs and multimodal instructions. To facilitate future research, we establish a benchmark to evaluate MEIT with various LLMs backbones across two large-scale ECG datasets. Our approach uniquely aligns the representations of the ECG signal and the report, and we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark MEIT with nine open source LLMs, using more than 800,000 ECG reports. MEIT's results underscore the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs, showcasing their proficiency in quality report generation, zero-shot capabilities, and resilience to signal perturbation. These findings emphasize the efficacy of our MEIT framework and its potential for real-world clinical application.</description>

      <title>D$^2$-JSCC: Digital Deep Joint Source-channel Coding for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemCom) have emerged as a new paradigm for supporting sixth-generation applications, where semantic features of data are transmitted using artificial intelligence algorithms to attain high communication efficiencies. Most existing SemCom techniques utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to implement analog source-channel mappings, which are incompatible with existing digital communication architectures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework of digital deep joint source-channel coding (D$^2$-JSCC) targeting image transmission in SemCom. The framework features digital source and channel codings that are jointly optimized to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) distortion. First, deep source coding with an adaptive density model is designed to encode semantic features according to their distributions. Second, digital channel coding is employed to protect encoded features against channel distortion. To facilitate their joint design, the E2E distortion is characterized as a function of the source and channel rates via the analysis of the Bayesian model and Lipschitz assumption on the DNNs. Then to minimize the E2E distortion, a two-step algorithm is proposed to control the source-channel rates for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms classic deep JSCC and mitigates the cliff and leveling-off effects, which commonly exist for separation-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Visual Decoding and Reconstruction via EEG Embeddings with Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How to decode human vision through neural signals has attracted a long-standing interest in neuroscience and machine learning. Modern contrastive learning and generative models improved the performance of fMRI-based visual decoding and reconstruction. However, the high cost and low temporal resolution of fMRI limit their applications in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), prompting a high need for EEG-based visual reconstruction. In this study, we present an EEG-based visual reconstruction framework. It consists of a plug-and-play EEG encoder called the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM), which is aligned with image embeddings, and a two-stage EEG guidance image generator that first transforms EEG features into image priors and then reconstructs the visual stimuli with a pre-trained image generator. Our approach allows EEG embeddings to achieve superior performance in image classification and retrieval tasks. Our two-stage image generation strategy vividly reconstructs images seen by humans. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of signals from different time windows and brain regions on decoding and reconstruction. The versatility of our framework is demonstrated in the magnetoencephalogram (MEG) data modality. We report that EEG-based visual decoding achieves SOTA performance, highlighting the portability, low cost, and high temporal resolution of EEG, enabling a wide range of BCI applications. The code of ATM is available at https://github.com/dongyangli-del/EEG_Image_decode.</description>
