      <title>A Network-Based Measure of Cosponsorship Influence on Bill Passing in the United States House of Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each year, the United States Congress considers {thousands of legislative proposals to select bills} to present to the US President to sign into law. Naturally, the decision processes of members of Congress are subject to peer influence. In this paper, we examine the effect on bill passage of accrued influence between US Congress members in the US House of Representatives. We explore how the influence of a bill's cosponsors affects the bill's outcome (specifically, whether or not it passes in the House). We define a notion of influence by analyzing the structure of a network that we construct {using} cosponsorship dynamics. We award `influence' between a pair of Congress members when they cosponsor a bill that achieves some amount of legislative success. We find that properties of the bill cosponsorship network can be a useful signal to examine influence in Congress; they help explain why some bills pass and others fail. We compare our measure of influence to off-the-shelf centrality measures and conclude that our influence measure is more indicative of bill passage.</description>

      <title>Reranking Social Media Feeds: A Practical Guide for Field Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media plays a central role in shaping public opinion and behavior, yet performing experiments on these platforms and, in particular, on feed algorithms is becoming increasingly challenging. This article offers practical recommendations to researchers developing and deploying field experiments focused on real-time re-ranking of social media feeds. This article is organized around two contributions. First, we overview an experimental method using web browser extensions that intercepts and re-ranks content in real-time, enabling naturalistic re-ranking field experiments. We then describe feed interventions and measurements that this paradigm enables on participants' actual feeds, without requiring the involvement of social media platforms. Second, we offer concrete technical recommendations for intercepting and re-ranking social media feeds with minimal user-facing delay, and provide an open-source implementation. This document aims to summarize lessons learned, provide concrete implementation details, and foster the ecosystem of independent social media research.</description>

      <title>Sampled Datasets Risk Substantial Bias in the Identification of Political Polarization on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following recent policy changes by X (Twitter) and other social media platforms, user interaction data has become increasingly difficult to access. These restrictions are impeding robust research pertaining to social and political phenomena online, which is critical due to the profound impact social media platforms may have on our societies. Here, we investigate the reliability of polarization measures obtained from different samples of social media data by studying the structural polarization of the Polish political debate on Twitter over a 24-hour period. First, we show that the political discussion on Twitter is only a small subset of the wider Twitter discussion. Second, we find that large samples can be representative of the whole political discussion on a platform, but small samples consistently fail to accurately reflect the true structure of polarization online. Finally, we demonstrate that keyword-based samples can be representative if keywords are selected with great care, but that poorly selected keywords can result in substantial political bias in the sampled data. Our findings demonstrate that it is not possible to measure polarization in a reliable way with small, sampled datasets, highlighting why the current lack of research data is so problematic, and providing insight into the practical implementation of the European Union's Digital Service Act which aims to improve researchers' access to social media data.</description>

      <title>A political radicalization framework based on Moral Foundations Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moral Foundations Theory proposes that individuals with conflicting political views base their behavior on different principles chosen from a small group of universal moral foundations. This study proposes using a set of widely accepted moral foundations (Fairness, Ingroup loyalty, Authority, and Purity) as proxies to determine the degree of radicalization of online communities. The fifth principle, Care, is generally surpassed by others, which are higher in the radicalized groups' moral hierarchy. Moreover, the presented data-driven methodological framework proposes an alternative way to measure whether a community complies with some moral principle or foundation: not evaluating its speech, but its behavior through interactions of its individuals, establishing a bridge between structural features of the interaction network and the intensity of communities' radicalization regarding the considered moral foundations. Two foundations may be assessed using the network's structural characteristics: Ingroup loyalty measured by group-level modularity, and Authority evaluated using group domination for detecting potential hierarchical substructures within the network. By analyzing the set of Pareto-optimal groups regarding a multidimensional moral relevance scale, the most radicalized communities are identified among those considered extreme in some of their attitudes or views. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated using real-world datasets. The radicalized communities' behavior exhibits increasing isolation, and its authorities and leaders show growing domination over their audience. There were also detected differences between users' behavior and speech, showing that individuals tend to share more 'extreme' ingroup content than that they publish: extreme views get more likes on social media.</description>

      <title>Shaping New Norms for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08564v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, the need for new norms is urgent. However, AI evolves at a much faster pace than the characteristic time of norm formation, posing an unprecedented challenge to our societies. This paper examines possible criticalities of the processes of norm formation surrounding AI. Thus, it focuses on how new norms can be established, rather than on what these norms should be. It distinguishes different scenarios based on the centralisation or decentralisation of the norm formation process, analysing the cases where new norms are shaped by formal authorities, informal institutions, or emerge spontaneously in a bottom-up fashion. On the latter point, the paper reports a conversation with ChatGPT in which the LLM discusses some of the emerging norms it has observed. Far from seeking exhaustiveness, this article aims to offer readers interpretive tools to understand society's response to the growing pervasiveness of AI. An outlook on how AI could influence the formation of future social norms emphasises the importance for open societies to anchor their formal deliberation process in an open, inclusive, and transparent public discourse.</description>

      <title>Demarked: A Strategy for Enhanced Abusive Speech Moderation through Counterspeech, Detoxification, and Message Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, such as recent EU regulations targeting digital violence, abusive content persists as a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on binary solutions, such as outright blocking or banning, yet fail to address the complex nature of abusive speech. In this work, we propose a more comprehensive approach called Demarcation scoring abusive speech based on four aspect -- (i) severity scale; (ii) presence of a target; (iii) context scale; (iv) legal scale -- and suggesting more options of actions like detoxification, counter speech generation, blocking, or, as a final measure, human intervention. Through a thorough analysis of abusive speech regulations across diverse jurisdictions, platforms, and research papers we highlight the gap in preventing measures and advocate for tailored proactive steps to combat its multifaceted manifestations. Our work aims to inform future strategies for effectively addressing abusive speech online.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>

      <title>Does Geo-co-location Matter? A Case Study of Public Health Conversations during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms like Twitter (now X) have been pivotal in information dissemination and public engagement, especially during COVID-19. A key goal for public health experts was to encourage prosocial behavior that could impact local outcomes such as masking and social distancing. Given the importance of local news and guidance during COVID-19, the objective of our research is to analyze the effect of localized engagement, on social media conversations. This study examines the impact of geographic co-location, as a proxy for localized engagement between public health experts (PHEs) and the public, on social media. We analyze a Twitter conversation dataset from January 2020 to November 2021, comprising over 19 K tweets from nearly five hundred PHEs, along with approximately 800 K replies from 350 K participants. Our findings reveal that geo-co-location is associated with higher engagement rates, especially in conversations on topics including masking, lockdowns, and education, and in conversations with academic and medical professionals. Lexical features associated with emotion and personal experiences were more common in geo-co-located contexts. This research provides insights into how geographic co-location influences social media engagement and can inform strategies to improve public health messaging.</description>

      <title>The Persistence of Contrarianism on Twitter: Mapping users' sharing habits for the Ukraine war, COVID-19 vaccination, and the 2022 Midterm Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical studies of online disinformation emphasize matters of public concern such as the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign election interference, and the Russo-Ukraine war, largely in studies that treat the topics separately. Comparatively fewer studies attempt to relate such disparate topics and address the extent to which they share behaviors. In this study, we compare three samples of Twitter data on COVID-19 vaccination, the Ukraine war and the 2022 midterm elections, to ascertain how distinct ideological stances of users across the three samples might be related. Our results indicate the emergence of a broad contrarian stance that is defined by its opposition to public health narratives/policies along with the Biden administration's foreign policy stances. Sharing activity within the contrarian position falls on a spectrum with outright conspiratorial content on one end. We confirm the existence of ideologically coherent cross-subject stances among Twitter users, but in a manner not squarely aligned with right-left political orientations.</description>

      <title>The G-invariant graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17001v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Laplacian based algorithms for data lying on a manifold have been proven effective for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and denoising. In this work, we consider data sets whose data points lie on a manifold that is closed under the action of a known unitary matrix Lie group G. We propose to construct the graph Laplacian by incorporating the distances between all the pairs of points generated by the action of G on the data set. We deem the latter construction the ``G-invariant Graph Laplacian'' (G-GL). We show that the G-GL converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the data manifold, while enjoying a significantly improved convergence rate compared to the standard graph Laplacian which only utilizes the distances between the points in the given data set. Furthermore, we show that the G-GL admits a set of eigenfunctions that have the form of certain products between the group elements and eigenvectors of certain matrices, which can be estimated from the data efficiently using FFT-type algorithms. We demonstrate our construction and its advantages on the problem of filtering data on a noisy manifold closed under the action of the special unitary group SU(2).</description>

      <title>Attraction by pairwise coherence explains the emergence of ideological sorting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Political polarization has become a growing concern in democratic societies, as it drives tribal alignments and erodes civic deliberation among citizens. Given its prevalence across different countries, previous research has sought to understand under which conditions people tend to endorse extreme opinions. However, in polarized contexts, citizens not only adopt more extreme views but also become correlated across issues that are, a priori, seemingly unrelated. This phenomenon, known as "ideological sorting", has been receiving greater attention in recent years but the micro-level mechanisms underlying its emergence remain poorly understood. Here, we study the conditions under which a social dynamic system is expected to become ideologically sorted as a function of the mechanisms of interaction between its individuals. To this end, we developed and analyzed a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two mechanisms: homophily (where people tend to interact with those holding similar opinions) and pairwise-coherence favoritism (where people tend to interact with ingroups holding politically coherent opinions). We numerically integrated the model's master equations that perfectly describe the system's dynamics and found that ideological sorting only emerges in models that include pairwise-coherence favoritism. We then compared the model's outcomes with empirical data from 24,035 opinions across 67 topics and found that pairwise-coherence favoritism is significantly present in datasets that measure political attitudes but absent across topics not considered related to politics. Overall, this work combines theoretical approaches from system dynamics with model-based analyses of empirical data to uncover a potential mechanism underlying the pervasiveness of ideological sorting.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Model of Bipartite Networks: Application to Cosponsorship in the United States Senate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many networks in political and social research are bipartite, with edges connecting exclusively across two distinct types of nodes. A common example includes cosponsorship networks, in which legislators are connected indirectly through the bills they support. Yet most existing network models are designed for unipartite networks, where edges can arise between any pair of nodes. However, using a unipartite network model to analyze bipartite networks, as often done in practice, can result in aggregation bias and artificially high-clustering -- a particularly insidious problem when studying the role groups play in network formation. To address these methodological problems, we develop a statistical model of bipartite networks theorized to be generated through group interactions by extending the popular mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel. Our model allows researchers to identify the groups of nodes, within each node type in the bipartite structure, that share common patterns of edge formation. The model also incorporates both node and dyad-level covariates as the predictors of group membership and of observed dyadic relations. We develop an efficient computational algorithm for fitting the model, and apply it to cosponsorship data from the United States Senate. We show that legislators in a Senate that was perfectly split along party lines were able to remain productive and pass major legislation by forming non-partisan, power-brokering coalitions that found common ground through their collaboration on low-stakes bills. We also find evidence for norms of reciprocity, and uncover the substantial role played by policy expertise in the formation of cosponsorships between senators and legislation. We make an open-source software package available that makes it possible for other researchers to uncover similar insights from bipartite networks.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Agents in Mean-Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce networked communication to the mean-field game framework, in particular to oracle-free settings where $N$ decentralised agents learn along a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We prove that our architecture, with only a few reasonable assumptions about network structure, has sample guarantees bounded between those of the centralised- and independent-learning cases. We discuss how the sample guarantees of the three theoretical algorithms do not actually result in practical convergence. We therefore show that in practical settings where the theoretical parameters are not observed (leading to poor estimation of the Q-function), our communication scheme significantly accelerates convergence over the independent case (and often even the centralised case), without relying on the assumption of a centralised learner. We contribute further practical enhancements to all three theoretical algorithms, allowing us to present their first empirical demonstrations. Our experiments confirm that we can remove several of the theoretical assumptions of the algorithms, and display the empirical convergence benefits brought by our new networked communication. We additionally show that the networked approach has significant advantages, over both the centralised and independent alternatives, in terms of robustness to unexpected learning failures and to changes in population size.</description>

      <title>Empowering Interdisciplinary Insights with Dynamic Graph Embedding Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed DyGETViz, a novel framework for effectively visualizing dynamic graphs (DGs) that are ubiquitous across diverse real-world systems. This framework leverages recent advancements in discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) models to adeptly handle the temporal dynamics inherent in dynamic graphs. DyGETViz effectively captures both micro- and macro-level structural shifts within these graphs, offering a robust method for representing complex and massive dynamic graphs. The application of DyGETViz extends to a diverse array of domains, including ethology, epidemiology, finance, genetics, linguistics, communication studies, social studies, and international relations. Through its implementation, DyGETViz has revealed or confirmed various critical insights. These include the diversity of content sharing patterns and the degree of specialization within online communities, the chronological evolution of lexicons across decades, and the distinct trajectories exhibited by aging-related and non-related genes. Importantly, DyGETViz enhances the accessibility of scientific findings to non-domain experts by simplifying the complexities of dynamic graphs. Our framework is released as an open-source Python package for use across diverse disciplines. Our work not only addresses the ongoing challenges in visualizing and analyzing DTDG models but also establishes a foundational framework for future investigations into dynamic graph representation and analysis across various disciplines.</description>
