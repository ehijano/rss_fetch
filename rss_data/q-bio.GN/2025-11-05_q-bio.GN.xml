      <title>LA-MARRVEL: A Knowledge-Grounded and Language-Aware LLM Reranker for AI-MARRVEL in Rare Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing rare diseases often requires connecting variant-bearing genes to evidence that is written as unstructured clinical prose, which the current established pipelines still leave for clinicians to reconcile manually. To this end, we introduce LA-MARRVEL, a knowledge-grounded and language-aware reranking layer that operates on top of AI-MARRVEL: it supplies expert-engineered context, queries a large language model multiple times, and aggregates the resulting partial rankings with a ranked voting method to produce a stable, explainable gene ranking. Evaluated on three real-world cohorts (BG, DDD, UDN), LA-MARRVEL consistently improves Recall@K over AI-MARRVEL and established phenotype-driven tools such as Exomiser and LIRICAL, with especially large gains on cases where the first-stage ranker placed the causal gene lower. Each ranked gene is accompanied by LLM-generated reasoning that integrates phenotypic, inheritance, and variant-level evidence, thereby making the output more interpretable and facilitating clinical review.</description>

      <title>Computational strategies for cross-species knowledge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research organisms provide invaluable insights into human biology and diseases, serving as essential tools for functional experiments, disease modeling, and drug testing. However, evolutionary divergence between humans and research organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here, we review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge across species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data and/or molecular networks. Our review addresses four key areas: (1) transferring disease and gene annotation knowledge across species, (2) identifying functionally equivalent molecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets, and (4) identifying equivalent cell types. We conclude with an outlook on future directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species knowledge transfer, including introducing the concept of "agnology" to describe functional equivalence of biological entities, regardless of their evolutionary origins. This concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models where evolutionary origins of functions can remain unresolved.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global transition consistency.
  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence, encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional organization.
  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference, antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster), and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory patterns drive prediction.</description>

      <title>AGNES: Adaptive Graph Neural Network and Dynamic Programming Hybrid Framework for Real-Time Nanopore Seed Chaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</description>

      <title>Lower-dimensional projections of cellular expression improves cell type classification from single-cell RNA sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular diversity at single cell level. It provides a global view of cell-type specification during the onset of biological mechanisms such as developmental processes and human organogenesis. Various statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for cell-type classification. Most of the methods utilizes unsupervised lower dimensional projections obtained from for a large reference data. In this work, we proposed a reference-based method for cell type classification, called EnProCell. The EnProCell, first, computes lower dimensional projections that capture both the high variance and class separability through an ensemble of principle component analysis and multiple discriminant analysis. In the second phase, EnProCell trains a deep neural network on the lower dimensional representation of data to classify cell types. The proposed method outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods when tested on four different data sets produced from different single-cell sequencing technologies. The EnProCell showed higher accuracy (98.91) and F1 score (98.64) than other methods for predicting reference from reference datasets. Similarly, EnProCell also showed better performance than existing methods in predicting cell types for data with unknown cell types (query) from reference datasets (accuracy:99.52; F1 score: 99.07). In addition to improved performance, the proposed methodology is simple and does not require more computational resources and time. the EnProCell is available at https://github.com/umar1196/EnProCell.</description>

      <title>HyperHELM: Hyperbolic Hierarchy Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.</description>
