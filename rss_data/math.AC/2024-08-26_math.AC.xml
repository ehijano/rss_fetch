      <title>Ideal-based quasi cozero divisor graph of a commutative ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative ring with identity, and let I be an ideal of R. The zero-divisor graph of R with respect to I, denoted by $\Gamma_I(R)$, is the graph whose vertices are the set $\{x \in R \setminus I | xy \in I$ for some $y \in R \setminus I\}$, where distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if $xy \in I$. The cozero-divisor graph with respect to I, denoted by $\Gamma''_I(R)$, is the graph of $R$ with vertices $\{x \in R \setminus I | xR + I \neq R\}$, and two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if $x \notin yR + I$ and $y \notin xR + I$. In this paper, we introduce and investigate an undirected graph $Q\Gamma''_I(R)$ of R with vertices $\{x \in R \setminus \sqrt{I} | xR + I \neq R$ and $xR + \sqrt{I} = xR + I\}$ and two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if $x \notin yR + I$ and $y \notin xR + I$.</description>

      <title>Solvable and Nilpotent Matroids: Realizability and Irreducible Decomposition of Their Associated Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, and study their realization spaces and their closures. Specifically, we analyze their associated varieties and their irreducible decompositions. Additionally, we study a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, and compute a finite set of defining equations of their associated matroid varieties.</description>

      <title>Regularity, singularities and $h$-vector of graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.01116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a standard graded algebra over a field. We investigate how the singularities of $R$ affect its $h$-vector, which is the coefficients of the numerator of its Hilbert series. The most concrete consequences of our work asserts that if $R$ satisfies Serre's condition $(S_r)$ and have reasonable singularities (Du Bois on the punctured spectrum or $F$-pure), then $h_0,\dots, h_r\geq 0$. Furthermore the multiplicity of $R$ is at least $h_0+h_1+\dots+h_{r-1}$. We also prove that equality in many cases forces $R$ to be Cohen-Macaulay. The main technical tools are sharp bounds on regularity of certain Ext modules, which can be viewed as Kodaira-type vanishing statements for Du Bois and $F$-singularities. Many corollaries are deduced, for instance that nice singularities of small codimension must be Cohen-Macaulay. Our results build on and extend previous work by de Fernex-Ein, Eisenbud-Goto, Huneke-Smith, Murai-Terai and others.</description>

      <title>On Waring numbers of henselian rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.09904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n&gt;1$ be a positive integer. Let $R$ be a henselian local ring with residue field $k$ of $n$th level $s_n(k)$. We give some upper and lower bounds for the $n$th Waring number $w_n(R)$ in terms of $w_n(k)$ and $s_n(k)$. In large number of cases we are able to compute $w_n(R)$. Similar results for the $n$th Waring number of the total ring of fractions of $R$ are obtained. We then provide applications. In particular we compute $w_n(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and $w_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for $n\in\{3,4,5\}$ and any prime $p$.</description>

      <title>Vanishing and non-negativity of the first normal Hilbert coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a Noetherian local ring such that $\widehat{R}$ is reduced. We prove that, when $\widehat{R}$ is $S_2$, if there exists a parameter ideal $Q\subseteq R$ such that $\bar{e}_1(Q)=0$, then $R$ is regular and $\nu(\mathfrak{m}/Q)\leq 1$. This leads to an affirmative answer to a problem raised by Goto-Hong-Mandal. We also give an alternative proof (in fact a strengthening) of their main result. In particular, we show that if $\widehat{R}$ is equidimensional, then $\bar{e}_1(Q)\geq 0$ for all parameter ideals $Q\subseteq R$, and in characteristic $p&gt;0$, we actually have $e_1^*(Q)\geq 0$. Our proofs rely on the existence of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras.</description>

      <title>Colength, multiplicity, and ideal closure operations II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R, \mathfrak{m})$ be a Noetherian local ring. This paper concerns several extremal invariants arising from the study of the relation between colength and (Hilbert--Samuel or Hilbert--Kunz) multiplicity of an $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal. We introduce versions of these invariants by restricting to various closures and ``cross-pollinate'' the two multiplicity theories by asking for analogues invariants already established in one of the theories.
  On the Hilbert--Samuel side, we prove that the analog of the St\"{u}ckrad--Vogel invariant (that is, the infimum of the ratio between the multiplicity and colength) for integrally closed $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideals is often $1$ under mild assumptions. We also compute the supremum and infimum of the relative drops of multiplicity for (integrally closed) $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideals. On the Hilbert--Kunz side, we study several analogs of the Lech--Mumford and St\"{u}ckrad--Vogel invariants.</description>

      <title>Rings where a non-nilpotent sum of units is a unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ring is *unit-additive* if a sum of units is always either a unit or nilpotent. For example, $k[X]$ and $k[X]/(X^2)$ are unit-additive, but $\mathbb Z$ is not. We prove a wide-ranging theorem about semigroup rings, showing among other things that an affine semigroup ring $A[M]$ is unit-additive if and only if $A$ is unit-additive and $M$ has no nontrivial invertible elements. In the algebraic variety setting, we get a characterization of unit additivity in terms of the nonexistence of nonconstant maps to the punctured affine line, which can be seen in terms of extensions of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Specializing to elliptic curves, we show that the affine coordinate ring of an elliptic curve is always unit-additive. The concept of unit additivity leads to the related concept of unit-additivity dimension -- i.e. how far is an integral domain from being unit-additive? It turns out that rings of unit-additivity dimension 1 are of some interest, as they include the rings of integers of number fields, all power series rings, and most local rings. We construct rings of all unit-additivity dimensions and show that in the affine setting, unit-additivity dimension is bounded above by Krull dimension. We also construct the *unit-additive closure* of an integral domain $D$, being the smallest subring of the fraction field of $D$ that is unit-additive, as a localization at a certain multiplicative set in $D$.</description>

      <title>Degree of $h$-polynomials of edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the degree of $h$-polynomials of edge ideals of finite simple graphs. In particular, we provide combinatorial formulas for the degree of the $h$-polynomial for various fundamental classes of graphs such as paths, cycles, and bipartite graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first investigation into the combinatorial interpretation of this algebraic invariant. Additionally, we characterize all connected graphs in which the sum of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the degree of the $h$-polynomial of an edge ideal reaches its maximum value, which is the number of vertices in the graph.</description>

      <title>On the maximum size of ultrametric orthogonal sets over discrete valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a discrete valued field with finite residue field. In analogy with orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a well-studied notion of "ultrametric orthogonality" in $\mathcal{K}^n$. In this paper, motivated by a question of Erd{\H{o}}s in the real case, given integers $k \geq \ell \geq 2$, we investigate the maximum size of a subset $S \subseteq \mathcal{K}^n \setminus\{{\bf 0}\}$ satisfying the following property: for any $E \subseteq S$ of size $k$, there exists $F \subseteq E$ of size $\ell$ such that any two distinct vectors in $F$ are orthogonal. Other variants of this property are also studied.</description>
