      <title>Capturing the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index from the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory with a domain-wall mass term, we construct a discretization of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for domains with compact boundary in a flat torus. We prove that, for sufficiently small lattice spacings, this discretization correctly captures the continuum Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Structure of Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian truncation for the two-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory within the framework of Hamiltonian truncation effective theory, where truncation artifacts are mitigated through a systematic inclusion of corrective terms organized in inverse powers of the ultraviolet energy cut-off $E_{\rm max}$. Building on the leading-order matching program, we develop two complementary extensions. First, we derive compact all-order expressions for the local matching corrections to the mass and quartic coupling by resumming infinite classes of diagrams sharing fixed topologies within the local approximation. Second, we extend the non-local sector by computing the next-to-next-to-local corrections contributing at $\mathcal{O}(E_{\rm max}^{-4})$, following a continuum-first matching procedure, in which the effective corrections are computed in infinite volume and the spatial direction is subsequently re-compactified to obtain a separable Hilbert-space basis on which the truncated operator construction is implemented. Our results show that an increasingly rich operator basis is necessary to describe the theory beyond leading order.</description>

      <title>Matter-induced plaquette terms in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a powerful framework for studying confinement, topological order, and exotic quantum matter. In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of confining strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum statistical properties of the confining string connecting a static fermion-antifermion pair in the massive Schwinger model. By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.</description>
