      <title>Scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes for ultrafast timing over keV-GeV energy scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise measurement of radiation has long played a vital role in a wide range of research and industrial fields, from fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model to medical imaging such as time-of-flight positron emission tomography. Developing radiation detectors that achieve high timing precision-on the order of a few tens of picoseconds-and energy measurement capabilities remains indispensable yet challenging. In this study, we developed two types of scintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs), one incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable simultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their performance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron annihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy measurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35% at 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions (CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained for both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic ray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1 and 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors, respectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in this study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In particular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the boundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold promise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Installation and first commissioning results of the JEF lead tungstate calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), consisting of 1,596 lead tungstate scintillating crystals, has been recently constructed and installed in Experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The calorimeter is a key component of the JLab Eta Factory Experiment, whose main goal is to measure the decays of eta and eta prime mesons into multi-photon final states. The ECAL replaces the inner part of the former forward lead-glass calorimeter. Scintillation light from each crystal is detected using Hamamatsu R4125 photomultiplier tubes. Calorimeter modules were fabricated and tested in the lab using light from light-emitting diodes before being installed in the detector frame. The detector is currently undergoing commissioning using the light monitoring system and cosmic rays. We will present an overview of the fabrication and testing of the calorimete modules, along with the first detector commissioning results. The ECAL was ready for data-taking in spring 2025.</description>

      <title>Rasnik 3-point alignment system: algorithm, control framework, and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rasnik is a three-point optical displacement sensor originally developed for particle detector alignment in high-energy physics experiments, including the muon chambers of L3 at LEP and ATLAS at the LHC. The system has evolved from four-quadrant photodiodes to CMOS pixel sensors with custom ChessField coded masks, enabling absolute position measurement with no cumulative drift due to absolute value coded. Key advantages include electromagnetic immunity through purely optical measurement principles, working distances from 50 mm to 15 m, and multi-degree-of-freedom sensitivity perpendicular to the optical axis. RasCal, a comprehensive control and analysis software, is presented in this paper and its real-time image processing shows 5 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ spatial resolution. With GPU acceleration, 274.5 Hz is achieved during live camera acquisition and 109 Hz on CPU. In maximum-throughput configurations, the processing rates exceed 300 Hz on simple consumer hardware. System performance is demonstrated across diverse applications: 5 pm/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ displacement sensitivity is achieved in the VATIGrav setup, dynamic behavior is characterized with a Watt's linkage. In addition, the lack of cumulative drift due to absolute coding with minimal thermal sensitivity under controlled conditions is used for vibration and thermal characterization of photodiode mounts for the LISA space mission. Millisecond-level command latency and thread-safe multi-camera support are provided by the RasCal software, establishing it as a robust and cost-effective precision measurement solution for demanding alignment applications in gravitational-wave detectors and space instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Ta-STJ Sensor Arrays for BSM Physics Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the $\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\sim$20 meV precision. Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the conversion of the Manitoba II mass spectrometer into a versatile proton beam facility. This infrastruc- ture is adaptable to any detector-under-test (DUT), and has proven itself effective with the characterization of silicon detectors used in subatomic beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) searches. This work discusses the modifications and subsequent tests to confirm the beam specifications met the demands of the aforementioned detectors.</description>

      <title>A borehole muon detector with SiPM-on-tile technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a compact and rugged muon detector designed for deployment in boreholes. The detector uses a SiPM-on-tile approach in which silicon photomultipliers are directly coupled to scintillator tiles, thereby eliminating the need for wavelength-shifting fibers and long scintillator bars. The modular design is based on a 64-channel unit, 140~cm in length and 80~mm in diameter, composed of $5 \times 5$~cm$^{2}$ scintillator tiles coupled to SiPMs, powered and read out using off-the-shelf electronics. The detector has an average muon detection efficiency above 95\% and acceptance over 5$^\circ$--60$^\circ$ in zenith and 0$^\circ$--360$^\circ$ in azimuth. Simulations indicate that reconstruction combining hit positions and energy deposits achieves a zenith resolution of 1.5--4.0$^\circ$ across most of the zenith range. This work demonstrates a compact, rugged, and cost-effective borehole muon detector based on the SiPM-on-tile approach, offering a new alternative for muon tomography.</description>

      <title>An Approach for Restoring Magnetic Field Uniformity in Openable BIPM-Type Kibble Balance Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble balance realizes the kilogram by linking mechanical and electrical quantities via a magnet system. In an improved BIPM-type magnet design by Tsinghua University, an open/close surface was incorporated, facilitating operation. However, an unavoidable mechanical air gap at the splitting plane introduces asymmetry in the magnetic flux density profile, degrading field uniformity. This study proposes a two-step yoke compensation method to restore symmetry by adjusting the upper outer yoke's inner radius and the splitting gap height. Finite element simulations show linear relationships between asymmetry and these parameters, enabling predictive compensation. Experimental results confirm that sequential tuning successfully eliminates asymmetry and recovers the designed uniform field range. The method provides an effective solution for enhancing magnetic field quality in openable Kibble balance magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-electron detectors are a key component of electron microscopes and advanced electron optics experiments. We present a YAG:Ce scintillator-based single-electron detector with a spatial resolution of 1 micrometer at an electron energy of 17 keV. Single-electron detection events are identified with an efficiency and purity larger than 0.8 at an electron energy of 17 keV, reaching 0.96 at 30 keV. We show that the detector enables electron diffraction studies with a sample-detector distance comparable to the mean free path of electrons at atmospheric pressure, potentially enabling atmospheric electron diffraction studies.</description>

      <title>Performance and long-term aging studies on Eco-Friendly Resistive Plate Chamber detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04777v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chambers detectors are extensively used in several domains of Physics. In High Energy Physics, they are typically operated in avalanche mode with a high-performance gas mixture based on Tetrafluoroethane (C2H2F4), a fluorinated high Global Warming Potential greenhouse gas. The RPC EcoGas@GIF++ Collaboration has pursued an intensive R\&amp;D activity to search for new gas mixtures with low environmental impact, fulfilling the performance expected for the LHC operations as well as for future and different applications. Here, results obtained with new eco-friendly gas mixtures based on Tetrafluoropropene and carbon dioxide, even under high-irradiation conditions, will be presented. Long-term aging tests carried out at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility will be discussed along with their possible limits and future perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) consisting of 1596 lead tungstate PbWO$_{\rm 4}$ scintillating crystals has been fabricated and installed in the experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The high-granularity, high-resolution calorimeter is required by the JLab Eta Factory experiment, whose main physics goal is to study rare decays of eta mesons. The ECAL replaced the inner part of the forward lead glass calorimeter of the GlueX detector. Signals from the detector will be digitized using twelve-bit flash analog-to-digital converters operated at a sampling rate of 250 MHz. The ECAL is integrated into the trigger system of the GlueX detector using electronics modules designed at JLab. The ECAL is currently at the commissioning stage and should be ready for the physics run in January 2025. We will give an overview of the JEF experiment, the design and construction of the ECAL, and the integration of the detector and its infrastructure into the Hall D experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers as charge readout operated in pure argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gain measurements of several 1 mm-thick, 10$\times$10 cm$^2$ Thick Gaseous Electron Multipliers (ThGEMs), operated in pure argon at 3.3 bar and room temperature are presented. Electrostatic simulations, performed with the COMSOL MultiPhysics software, were employed to guide the design of the detectors, and the field configurations are discussed. A modified ThGEM design, incorporating two embedded internal electrodes in addition to the conventional top and bottom electrodes, was developed to mitigate discharge-induced instabilities and to enable operation at higher gains. Several such structures were produced and compared to the standard 1 mm-thick two-electrode ThGEM. Gain measurements were conducted for every design described here over a wide range of applied electric fields and up to large values. The experimental setup and measurement methodology are described, alongside a comparative analysis of the performance of the different detector geometries.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Magnetic Sensitivity Measurements of Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03653v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CCAT Observatory is a ground-based submillimeter to millimeter experiment located on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert, at an altitude of 5,600 meters. CCAT features the 6-meter Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), which will cover frequency bands from 210 GHz to 850 GHz using its first-generation science instrument, Prime-Cam. The detectors used in Prime-Cam are feedhorn-coupled, lumped-element superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The telescope will perform wide-area surveys at speeds on the order of degrees per second. During telescope operation, the KIDs are exposed to changes in the magnetic field caused by the telescope's movement through Earth's magnetic field and internal sources within the telescope. We present and compare measurements of the magnetic sensitivity of three different CCAT KID designs at 100 mK. The measurements are conducted in a dilution refrigerator (DR) with a set of room temperature Helmholtz coils positioned around the DR. We discuss the implications of these results for CCAT field operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new end-to-end experimental data streaming framework designed from the ground up to support new types of applications -- AI training, extremely high-rate X-ray time-of-flight analysis, crystal structure determination with distributed processing, and custom data science applications and visualizers yet to be created. Throughout, we use design choices merging cloud microservices with traditional HPC batch execution models for security and flexibility. This project makes a unique contribution to the DOE Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI) landscape. By creating a flexible, API-driven data request service, we address a significant need for high-speed data streaming sources for the X-ray science data analysis community. With the combination of data request API, mutual authentication web security framework, job queue system, high-rate data buffer, and complementary nature to facility infrastructure, the LCLStreamer framework has prototyped and implemented several new paradigms critical for future generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Radiopurity screening of materials for rare event searches by neutron activation at the TRIGA reactor of Pavia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of physics experiments searching for rare events, the selection of extremely radiopure materials is a challenging task, as the signal of interest is often hidden by instrumental background. Neutron activation is a powerful technique to measure trace contaminants with high sensitivity but, to be properly applied, it requires a good characterization of neutron irradiation and $\gamma$-spectroscopy facilities. This paper presents the state-of-the-art workflow adopted by the Radioactivity Laboratory of the University of Milano-Bicocca for radiopurity screening of materials by neutron activation performed at the TRIGA reactor in Pavia. The ultimate sensitivity of the described workflow, in the absence of interfering activation products and without the application of radiochemical and/or active background rejection techniques, is $&lt;10^{-14}$ g/g for $^{40}$K, $&lt;10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{238}$U and of the order of $10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{232}$Th contaminations. Further details are here provided to address systematic uncertainties related to neutron irradiation that may bias results. To this aim, a dedicated neutron activation campaign was performed and the data were analyzed exploiting a Monte Carlo simulation model of the reactor and applying an unfolding technique to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the neutron flux in typical irradiation configurations. The results of this work provide a valuable benchmark for the application of neutron activation in future radiopurity screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Object Condensation Clustering for Calorimeter Shower Reconstruction at CLAS12</title>

Abstract: Several nuclear physics studies using the CLAS12 detector rely on the accurate reconstruction of neutrons and photons from its forward angle calorimeter system. These studies often place restrictive cuts when measuring neutral particles due to an overabundance of false clusters created by the existing calorimeter reconstruction software. In this work, we present a new AI approach to clustering CLAS12 calorimeter hits based on the object condensation framework. The model learns a latent representation of the full detector topology using GravNet layers, serving as the positional encoding for an event's calorimeter hits which are processed by a Transformer encoder. This unique structure allows the model to contextualize local and long range information, improving its performance. Evaluated on one million simulated $e+p$ collision events, our method significantly improves cluster trustworthiness: the fraction of reliable neutron clusters, increasing from 8.88\% to 30.73\%, and photon clusters, increasing from 51.07\% to 64.73\%. Our study also marks the first application of AI clustering techniques for hodoscopic detectors, showing potential for usage in many other experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>

Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity of a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results allow the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run to be refined, leading to a constraint that is an order of magnitude stronger than previously reported (corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio which is four orders of magnitude larger). This result represents the world-leading constraint on dark photons over a wide range of masses below $6\,\rm \mu eV$ and translates to the best laboratory-based limits on the photon mass $m_\gamma&lt;2.9\times 10^{-48}\,\rm g$.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the absolute single-photon detection efficiency of HRPPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pixelated High Rate Picosecond Photon Detectors (HRPPDs) by Incom Inc. are promising photosensors for use in Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors, where a high gain, sub-mm position resolution and sub-100ps timing resolution are required in a single photon mode. Quantum Efficiency (QE) has been measured for the first batch of EIC HRPPDs both by Incom and EIC research groups at Jefferson Lab and Brookhaven Lab, with peak values at $\sim$365 nm typically exceeding 30%. In this study, we present a first direct measurement of Photon Detection Efficiency being equal to (17.1 $\pm$ 0.1 [stat] $\pm$ 0.3 [sys])% at 398.6 nm, for a pixel near the center of HRPPD, in a photoelectron pulse counting mode using a picosecond diode laser. HRPPD QE at the same spot and at the same wavelength was evaluated to be (24.4 $\pm$ 0.1 [stat] $\pm$ 0.3 [sys])%, leading to a Collection Efficiency estimate of (70.3 $\pm$ 1.6)%, which is consistent with the expectations.</description>
