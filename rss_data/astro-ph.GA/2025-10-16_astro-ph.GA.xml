      <title>Detecting Ca II Absorption Lines with a Fe II assisted Dual Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ca II absorbers, characterized by dusty and metal-rich environments, provide unique insights into the interstellar medium of galaxies. However, their rarity and weak absorption features have hindered comprehensive studies. In this work, we present a novel dual CNN approach to detect Ca II absorption systems, analyzing over 100,000 quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16. Our primary CNN identifies Ca II features, while a secondary CNN cross-verifies these detections using five Fe II absorption lines. This approach yielded 1,646 Ca II absorption systems, including 525 previously known absorbers and 1,121 new discoveries, nearly tripling the size of any previously reported catalog. Among our Ca II absorbers, 95 are found to show the 2175\r{A} dust feature (2DA), corresponding to 22% of strong absorbers, 7% of weak absorbers, and $\sim$12% of the overall Ca II population at $0.8 &lt; z_{\text{abs}} &lt; 1.4$. Across the full redshift range of $0.36 &lt; z_{\text{abs}} &lt; 1.4$, $\sim$1.5% of Mg II absorbers host Ca II.</description>

      <title>Modelling the nebular emission of galaxies across cosmic time with COLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extragalactic nebular emission has long been a workhorse probe of the processes driving galaxy evolution, but the richness of JWST spectroscopy has shifted the bottleneck from data acquisition to physical interpretation and modelling. In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular line and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal equilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver and radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately balancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling, free-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where non-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling prescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures in the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the equilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously excessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and cold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement a level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate cooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines, together with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from free-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to the high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line ratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular emission across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Strong Evidence for Cosmic Ray-Supported $\sim$L$^{\ast}$ Galaxy Halos via X-ray \&amp; tSZ Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many state-of-the-art galaxy simulations featuring traditional feedback modes have significant challenges producing enough extended soft X-ray ($\sim 0.5-2$ keV) emission at R $\sim 0.5-1$ R$_{\rm vir}$ observed around galaxies with stellar masses M$_{\rm \ast} \lesssim 10^{11} \rm M_\odot$, without violating galaxy mass function constraints. Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone -- if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ \&amp; X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{\rm 12} \rm M_\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.</description>

      <title>The ASTRID Simulation at z=0: from Massive Black Holes to Large-scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the $z=0$ results for the cosmological simulation ASTRID. Hosting $2\times 5500^3\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\, {\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\times10^{4}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{15}\ M_{\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}&gt;10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\star}\geq 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: The Hidden Neighbours of OI Absorbers during Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources that fall below the detection threshold of current instruments. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies within the redshift range $z = 5 - 8$. We find that the circumgalactic medium of galaxies becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of $\approx 0.2$ in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. The observable absorbers ($N_{\rm OI} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) are not confined to haloes: at $z \geq 5$ the majority ($\gtrsim 60\%$) arise beyond $R_{\rm{vir}}$, and including these systems is essential to reproduce the observed increase in absorber incidence with redshift. The simulated absorbers preferentially reside in overdensities rich in low-mass galaxies ($M_\star \leq 10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$), explaining the scarcity of detected counterparts, while not excluding the possibility of nearby star-forming sources ($\geq 5\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations and, at larger distances, by the JWST. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The Nephele ecosystem: stars, globular clusters, and stellar streams associated with the progenitor galaxy of $\omega$ Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) and their associated stellar streams are key tracers of the hierarchical assembly history of the Milky Way. $\omega$ Centauri, the most massive and chemically complex GC in the Galaxy, is widely believed to be the remnant nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy. Identifying its associated debris and that of chemically similar clusters can provide important constraints on the nature of this progenitor system. We aim to identify field stars that are chemically and kinematically linked to $\omega$ Cen and to a group of globular clusters associated with the Nephele accretion event. We analyse APOGEE DR17 data using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in a 8-dimensional chemical space to identify field stars whose abundances match those of $\omega$ Cen. We then compute the orbital energy and angular momentum of these stars and apply a second GMM, calibrated on simulations from the e-TidalGCs project, to determine kinematic compatibility with the predicted streams of $\omega$ Cen and the associated Nephele GCs. We identify 470 stars chemically compatible with $\omega$ Cen, of which 58 are also Al-rich, consistent with second-generation stars found in GCs. Of these, 6 stars show kinematics consistent with the predicted $\omega$ Cen stream, and additional stars are linked to the tidal streams of NGC 6205, NGC 6254, NGC 6273, NGC 6656, and NGC 6809. We also find overlap in chemical and kinematic properties between Nephele stars and the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus population. Our findings indicate stellar debris linked to $\omega$ Cen and its candidate globular cluster family, consistent with a shared, now-disrupted galactic progenitor. Despite residual uncertainties from disc contamination and limited sky coverage, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of combined chemical and dynamical analyses in uncovering relics of past accretion events in the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Planetary Nebulae in the Milky Way: Physical Properties, Chemical Abundances, and Galactic Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the physical and chemical properties of planetary nebulae (PNe) from the Milky Way Galaxy using the largest number of sources to date, with 1,449 True PNe from the HASH database. Among the Galactic components thin disk, thick disk, halo, and bulge-most PNe are concentrated in the Galactic disk, with a median angular size of 12 arcseconds (0.45 pc), while halo PNe tend to have larger sizes. Physical parameters of whole PNe, extinction coefficent c(Hbeta), electron temperature (Te), and density (Ne) show Gaussian-like distributions with medians of 1.5, 9,900 K, and 1,200 cm(-3), respectively. The abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar in PNe show Gaussian distributions with slight variations across Galactic components. PNe located in thin disk exhibit higher abundances, except for O and Ne, while PNe in halo have the lowest values for all elements. Strong correlations between elements, particularly Sulphur vs. Nitrogen (r=0.87), were identified using statistical tests. Comparisons with previous studies reveal variations ( 2 dex.) in abundance ratios, particularly in halo PNe. We also present the first detailed database in the literature, providing 7,200 abundance values for these elements, derived from 16,500 emission line measurements, to support the testing and development of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Connecting outflows with radio emission in AGN at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGN feedback is a well known mechanism in the evolution of galaxies. One open question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift, radio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving ionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies have investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our main goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with moderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in observations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed in earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at comparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the literature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure in our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649 aligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a jet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we found that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial scales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas present small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that the kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by outflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and ionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic considerations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a significant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low redshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot rule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the interstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic oscillations in optical color evolutions to support sub-pc binary black hole systems in broad line active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with periodicity around hundreds to thousands of days have been accepted as an efficient indicator for sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). However, considering intrinsic variability (red noises) of BLAGN, it is still an open question on physical origin of detected optical QPOs from AGN variability or truly from sub-pc BBHs. Here, a simple method is proposed to support optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent optical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are expected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be non-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN. Through simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by Continuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar as time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely smaller than $3.3\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding optical color evolutions, but about $3.1\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with periodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the simulated single-band light curves. Therefore, confidence level is definitely higher than 5$\sigma$ to support the QPOs in color evolutions not related to intrinsic AGN variability but truly related to sub-pc BBHs. In the near future, the proposed method can be applied for searching reliable optical QPOs in BLAGN through multi-band light curves from the ZTF and the upcoming LSST.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas content of gravitational-lensed quasars at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star-forming activity in the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars is crucial to understanding the connection between supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity and galaxy evolution. While most existing studies are biased toward luminous quasars, we conduct carbon monoxide (CO) observations of 17 gravitationally lensed quasars that have four images using the IRAM 30m telescope to investigate the molecular gas content of moderate- to low-luminosity quasars. CO emissions are detected in five out of 17 quasars, corresponding to a detection rate of about 30\%. Analysis of their star formation activity reveals that these quasars live in gas-rich environments but exhibit weaker starbursts and lower star formation efficiencies compared to other luminous high-redshift quasars. In addition, the CO spectral line energy distributions of the two quasars (SDSS J0924+0219, SDSS J1330+1810) are also consistent with mild star formation instead of extreme starbursts. These results suggest that these lensed quasars reside in weaker starburst environments.</description>

      <title>Dust extinction map of the Galactic plane based on the UKIDSS survey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust plays a critical role in the study of the interstellar medium (ISM). Extinction maps derived from optical surveys often fail to capture regions with high column density due to the limited photometric depth in optical wavelengths. To address these limitations, we developed the XPNICER method based on near-infrared (NIR) photometric survey data. This method combines the previously established PNICER and Xpercentile techniques, enabling effective mitigation of foreground contamination and improved handling of complex dust structures in the Galactic plane, which thus can provide more accurate extinction estimates, particularly in highly obscured regions. By applying XPNICER to the Galactic Plane Survey from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey, we have generated a series of two-dimensional (2D) dust extinction maps that span roughly 1800 deg2 of the Galactic plane (0&lt; l &lt; 110deg and 140&lt; l &lt; 232deg, |b| &lt; 5deg). These maps, with spatial resolutions between 30arcsec and 300arcsec, can trace extinction up to Av ~ 30-40 mag. This new approach offers higher spatial resolution and better detection of high-extinction regions compared to previous large-scale dust-based maps of the Galactic plane, providing an independent and complementary measure of dust column densities.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the absence of anomalous microwave emission in the M 31 halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a temperature asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data towards various galaxies has opened a window for a deeper comprehension of galactic halos. A crucial step forward is that of estimating the fraction of missing baryons in the halos, but it relies on understanding the real cause of the observed CMB temperature asymmetry since many effects might give a non-negligible contribution. Here, we analyzed the contribution played by the anomalous microwave emission (AME) from halo dust grains in the halo of the M 31 galaxy. Assuming either amorphous carbon and silicates dust grains with size ranging from $0.01~\mu$m to about $0.3~\mu$m and mass in the range $10^{-14} - 10^{-13}$ g, we estimated the total mass, distribution, and diffuse emission in the $100\,\mu$m band of the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Then, we estimated the temperature asymmetry induced by the rotation of the M 31 halo and compared the obtained values with the \textit{Planck}'s SMICA-processed data. We find that the AME cannot account for the measured CMB temperature asymmetry, with its contribution constrained to $\lesssim 7\%$, thereby indicating that additional physical mechanisms must be responsible for the observed signal.</description>

      <title>The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $&gt;3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}&gt;10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Active galactic nucleus outflows accelerate when they escape the bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale outflows driven by AGNs are an important element of galaxy evolution. Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the activity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of the host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of outflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately constant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\rm tr} \sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven outflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to expand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical code to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a constant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite bulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free parameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles, variations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of outflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles essentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density profile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves the fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they accelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of significant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of outflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can explain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The free parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable ranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the true conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion.</description>

      <title>Mergers lighting the early Universe: enhanced star formation, AGN triggering, and Ly$\alpha$ emission in close pairs at $z=3-9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers and interactions are often invoked to explain enhanced star formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z&gt;2$). We use JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs (projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) using a probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of $1.12 \pm 0.05$ at separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly detectable out to $\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales (50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations $&gt;5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-$\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Story of Chemical Evolution in Local Star-Forming Nuclear Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A VLT/MUSE population synthesis study of metallicities in the nuclear star-forming rings of four disk galaxies (NGC 613, NGC 1097, NGC 3351, NGC 7552) is presented. Disentangling the spectral contributions of young and old stellar populations, we find a large spread of ages and metallicities of the old stars in the nuclear rings. This indicates a persistent infall of metal-poor gas and ongoing episodic star formation over many gigayears. The young stars have metallicities a factor two to three higher than solar in all galaxies except NGC 3351, where the range is from half to twice solar. Previously reported detections of extremely metal poor regions at young stellar age on the rings of these four galaxies are a methodological artifact of the average over all stars, young and old. In addition, it is important to include contributions of very young stars ($&lt;6$ Myr) in this environment. For each of the four galaxies, the extinction maps generated through our population synthesis analysis provide support for the infall scenario. They reveal dust lanes along the leading edges of the stellar bars, indicating the flow of interstellar material towards the circumnuclear zone. Prominent stellar clusters show little extinction, most likely because of the onset of stellar winds. Inside and on the nuclear rings, regions that are largely free of extinction are detected.</description>

      <title>CHILLING: Continuum Halos in LVHIS Local Irregular Nearby Galaxies - Radio continuum spectral behavior of dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies, due to their shallow gravitational potentials, provide critical environments for studying feedback mechanisms from star formation and its impacts on dwarf galaxy evolution. In particular, radio continuum (RC) observations offer valuable insights into cosmic ray dynamics, which play a significant role in shaping these processes. This study investigates the detectability and spectral characteristics of RC emission in a sample of 15 dwarf galaxies (11 gas-rich, star forming dwarfs and 4 blue compact dwarfs) spanning a broad range of stellar masses and star formation histories. Using multi-band RC data (L/S-, C-, and X-band) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we analyse the physical conditions responsible for RC emission and explore the dominant emission mechanisms within these systems. RC emission is detected in 11 out of the 15 galaxies. Our results indicate that RC emission correlates strongly with star formation rate, far-infrared, and stellar mass, while dynamic parameters such as HI and rotational velocity exhibit no significant correlation with RC detectability. Spectral analysis reveals that the RC spectral energy distribution in these galaxies frequently deviate from a simple power-law behavior, instead displaying curvature that suggests more complex underlying physical processes. Statistical model comparison confirms that a single power-law model is inadequate to capture the observed spectral shapes, emphasising the necessity of more sophisticated approaches. Additionally, the observed radio-far-infrared correlation indicates that cosmic ray electrons in lower-mass dwarf galaxies cool more rapidly than they can escape (e.g. via galactic winds), resulting in a measurable RC deficit.</description>

      <title>The dark side of early galaxies: $\texttt{geko}$ uncovers dark-matter fractions at $z\sim4-6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r&lt;r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.</description>

      <title>The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey III: First data release of JCMT CO-line observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low- to intermediate-mass ($\sim$0.8$-$8 M$_\odot$) evolved stars contribute significantly to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium in the local Universe, making accurate mass-return estimates in their final stages crucial. The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) is a large multi-telescope project targeting a volume-limited sample of $\sim$850 stars within 3 kpc in order to derive the dust and gas return rates in the Solar Neighbourhood, and to constrain the physics underlying these processes. We present an initial analysis of the CO-line observations, including detection statistics, carbon isotopic ratios, initial mass-loss rates, and gas-to-dust ratios. We describe a new data reduction pipeline to analyse the available NESS CO data from the JCMT, measuring line parameters and calculating empirical gas mass-loss rates. We present the first release of the available data on 485 sources, one of the largest homogeneous samples of CO data to date. Comparison with a large literature sample finds that high mass-loss rate and especially carbon-rich sources are over-represented in literature, while NESS is probing significantly more sources at low mass-loss rates, detecting 59 sources in CO for the first time and providing useful upper limits. CO line detection rates are 81% for the CO (2--1) line and 75% for CO (3--2). The majority (82%) of detected lines conform to the expected soft parabola shape, while eleven sources show a double wind. Calculated mass-loss rates show power-law relations with both the dust-production rates and expansion velocities up to $\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}$~\msunyr. Median gas-to-dust ratios of 250 and 680 are found for oxygen-rich and carbon-rich sources, respectively. Our analysis of CO observations in this first data release highlights the importance of our volume-limited approach in characterizing the local AGB population as a whole.</description>

      <title>The Launching of Galactic Winds from a Multiphase ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic outflows are a key agent of galaxy evolution, yet their observed multiphase nature remains difficult to reconcile with theoretical models, which often fail to explain how cold gas survives interactions with hot, fast winds. We present high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic simulations of hot outflows interacting with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), parameterised by its cold-gas volume filling fraction $f_v$, depth $L_{\rm ISM}$, and clump size $r_{\rm cl}$. We identify a universal survival criterion $f_v L_{\rm ISM} \gtrsim r_{\rm crit}$ that generalises the classical single-cloud condition ($r_{\rm cl} &gt; r_{\rm crit}$) and correctly predicts cold-gas survival across diverse ISM configurations - including scale-free - down to $r_{\rm cl}/r_{\rm crit} \sim 10^{-2}$. The surviving cold phase rapidly loses memory of the initial ISM structure and evolves toward a self-similar clump mass spectrum following Zipf's law ($\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}m \propto m^{-2}$), implying that turbulent mixing and radiative condensation universally shape multiphase outflows. Cold gas assembles into plumes or confined shells of size $\sim \chi r_{\mathrm{cl,min}}$, growing as mass is accreted from the hot phase. The interaction of a laminar wind with a clumpy ISM drives turbulence in both phases, with first-order velocity structure functions following a Kolmogorov scaling and an injection scale set by $L_{\rm ISM}$, while velocity dispersions reach $\sigma \sim c_{\rm s,cold}$. The areal covering fraction of cold gas approaches unity even for $f_v \sim 10^{-3}$, though its volume filling fraction stays low, explaining the "misty" appearance of observed outflows. Together, these results link small-scale cloud-wind interactions to galaxy-scale feedback, and we discuss their implications for interpreting observations and for modelling multiphase galactic winds in larger-scale simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the automatic stellar stream detection algorithm StarStream to Gaia Data Release 3 and identify 87 stellar streams associated with Galactic globular clusters (GCs), including 34 high-quality cases with median completeness and purity both exceeding 50%, as estimated from modeling mock streams. These detections double the number of known GC streams, and increase the fraction of GCs with tidal streams at high Galactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 30 degree) to 75%. In contrast to visual expectations, many new streams are wide or short, or misaligned with their progenitors' orbits. Taking advantage of the unbiased density measurements enabled by our method, we also estimate the mass loss rate for the progenitor GCs. We find that several low-mass, large-size clusters have enhanced mass loss rates, indicating that they are approaching complete tidal disruption.</description>

      <title>StarStream: Automatic detection algorithm for stellar streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has led to the discovery of over 100 stellar streams in the Milky Way, most of which likely originated from globular clusters (GCs). As the upcoming wide-field surveys can potentially continue to increase the number of known streams, there is a growing need to shift focus from manual detection of individual streams to automated detection methods that prioritize both quality and quantity. Traditional techniques rely heavily on the visual expectation that GC streams are dynamically cold and thin. This assumption does not hold for all streams, whose morphologies and kinematics can vary significantly with the progenitor's mass and orbit. As a result, these methods are biased toward a subset of the whole stream population, with often unquantified purity and completeness. In this work, we present StarStream, an automatic stream detection algorithm based on a physics-inspired model rather than visual expectation. Our method provides a more accurate prediction of stream stars in the multi-dimensional space of observables, while using fewer free parameters to account for the diversity of streams. Applied to a mock GC stream catalog tailored for the Gaia DR3 dataset, our algorithm achieves both purity and completeness of at least 65% at Galactic latitudes |b| &gt; 30 degree.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</description>

      <title>Probing Helium Reionization Through the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ Hyperfine Transition Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperfine transition of $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ as a promising probe of the IGM during the final stages of helium reionization. Utilising the most recent helium reionization simulation, we generate three-dimensional maps of the 3.5cm ($8.67$ GHz) differential brightness temperature and analyze its evolution. Our results show that the volume-averaged brightness temperature declines rapidly from $\sim 1 \mu$K at $z = 4$ to $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \mu$K by $z = 2.3$, tracing the HeII to HeIII transition driven by quasars. The power spectrum of the 3.5cm signal exhibits a scale-dependent evolution, peaking on small scales and declining as reionization progresses. We explore the cross-correlation of the 3.5cm transition line with the distribution of AGNs, which shows a transition from positive to negative correlation as ionized regions grow. We also examine the 3.5cm forest and demonstrate that absorption features persist down to $z \sim 2.90$, even when more than $85\%$ of HeII is ionized. Although current observational upper limits lie several orders of magnitude above theoretical predictions, future radio arrays such as $\mathrm{SKA-mid}$ offer promising prospects. Overall, this study highlights the $^{3}\mathrm{He}^{+}$ hyperfine transition as a sensitive tracer of the thermal and ionization history of the IGM during helium reionization.</description>

      <title>The variability of active galaxies: I. Broad-band noise X-ray power spectra from XMM-Newton and Swift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.</description>

      <title>Numerical Studies on the Radio Afterglows in TDE (I): Forward Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent long-term radio monitoring of tidal disruption events (TDEs) suggests that radio afterglows are common. Most studies argue that these afterglows may arise from forward shocks (FS) produced by the interaction between the TDE outflow and the hot, diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM). Current theoretical models do not model the evolution of relativistic electrons in space, which introduces uncertainties. Here we conducted hydrodynamic simulations to study the hydrodynamic evolution of relativistic electrons, and calculated the synchrotron spectra via radiative transfer. We focus on the FS scenario with non-relativistic outflows, and various parameters of the outflow and CNM are explored. A moderate outflow with kinetic energy of several $10^{50}$ erg in a Galactic center - like CNM can produce mJy-level radio afterglows at a distance of 100 Mpc. The self-absorption frequency exhibits a slow decline at early times and a rapid decrease at late times. We derived the temporal evolution of the high-frequency radio flux, revealing its characteristic rise and decline pattern. We also find that: (1) the radio spectra for narrow outflows are clearly anisotropic along different sight lines; (2) the FS parameters inferred from radio spectra using conventional analytical formulas deviate significantly from those in simulations, in which the inferred shock radii are half of those from simulations, and the inferred energies are an order of magnitude lower.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Subhalo Mass Functions in Simulations from Galaxy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful tool to directly infer the dark matter (DM) subhalo mass function (SHMF) in lens galaxies. However, comparing observationally inferred SHMFs to theoretical predictions remains challenging, as the predicted SHMF can vary significantly between galaxies - even within the same cosmological model - due to differences in the properties and environment of individual galaxies. We present a machine learning framework to infer the galaxy-specific predicted SHMF from galaxy images, conditioned on the assumed inverse warm DM particle mass $M^{-1}_{\rm DM}$. To train the model, we use 1024 high-resolution hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations from the DREAMS suite. Mock observations are generated using Synthesizer, excluding gas particle contributions, and SHMFs are computed with the Rockstar halo finder. Our neural network takes as input both the galaxy images and the inverse DM mass. This method enables scalable, image-based predictions for the theoretical DM SHMFs of individual galaxies, facilitating direct comparisons with observational measurements.</description>

      <title>AREPO-RSG: Aspherical Circumstellar Material and Winds from Pulsating Dusty Red Supergiants in Global 3D Radiation Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a surprisingly large fraction of hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) interacting with dense confined circumstellar material (CSM), whose origin is heavily debated. Exploiting our recent implementation of a sophisticated radiation transport scheme in the moving-mesh code AREPO, we perform full-sphere 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations of red supergiant envelopes. For $10\, M_\odot$ and $20\, M_\odot$ core-carbon-burning stars, we find that large-amplitude radial pulsations lift the surface material of density $10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\; \mathrm{g\; cm^{-3}}$ to the circumstellar environment up to $3\times10^{14}$ cm, consistent with the inferred density for the interacting SN 2013fs. There, radiation acts on dust to drive highly anisotropic outflows of $10^{-6}$-$10^{-5}\, M_\odot\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The total CSM masses for both simulations are $\sim 0.01\, M_\odot$. Due to convection, the CSM density structure has order-of-magnitude angular variations, dominated by large-scale asymmetries. We suggest that (1) the CSM around the progenitor is bound material instead of a widely-assumed steady wind, (2) highly aspherical CSM is common and can be created by surface convection rather than only from binary interactions, and (3) 3D effects need to be incorporated in 1D SN modeling, potentially via effective clumping. Based on our simulations, we propose a 1D analytical CSM model to be directly used for SN observable modeling. We predict that progenitor pulsations (seen in SN 2023ixf) and highly-confined CSM (seen in SN 2013fs) should be common among most hydrogen-rich SNe. This can be tested with progenitor monitoring using Rubin Observatory and near-future high-cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT and UVEX.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength analysis of the progenitor of GRB 230307A via Bayesian model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole. Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} = 1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$, with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} = 471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within $v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and $a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fermi Bubbles Without AGN: Gamma-Ray Bubbles in MHD Galaxy Formation Simulations with Full Cosmic Ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we show in MHD simulations with cosmological initial conditions that bi-lobed gamma-ray outflows similar to the Fermi bubbles can form from star formation and supernova feedback, without involvement from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We use simulations run with full MHD and dynamical, on-the-fly multi-species cosmic ray transport in MeV-TeV energy bins to model gamma-ray emission in Milky Way-mass spiral galaxies from neutral pion decay, relativistic non-thermal Bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton scattering. We find that these gamma-ray outflows are present in all three Milky-Way mass simulated galaxies. The amplitude, shape, and the composition of the gamma-ray spectrum of these bubbles fluctuates over time, with lepton-dominated and hadron-dominated phases. Spectra in which there is O(1) more gamma-ray flux from inverse Compton scattering than neutral pion decay are a good fit to the measured Fermi-LAT spectrum. Additionally, these simulations predict multi-wavelength features in soft x-rays and synchrotron radio, potentially providing new observational signatures that can connect the circumgalactic medium to cosmic ray physics and activity in the galactic center.</description>

Abstract: Galactic microquasar SS433 and the radio nebula W50 surrounding it present a prototypical example of a hyper-Eddington binary system shaping its ambient interstellar medium via energetic outflows. In this paper, we present X-ray observations of the SS433/W50 complex by the eROSITA telescope onboard the SRG space observatory. These data provide images of the entire nebula characterized by a very large dynamic range and allow spectral analysis of the diffuse X-ray emission. In particular, these data illustrate a close connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of W50 on scales ranging from sub-parsecs, represented by narrow X-ray bright filaments, to the entire extent $\gtrsim 100\,{\rm pc}$ of the nebula. These data also allow us to fully characterize a pair of nearly symmetric, sharp-edged, elongated structures aligned with the orbital axis of the binary system, which lack radio counterparts, but are prominent in very high energy gamma-ray emission. The resulting multifaceted picture of the interaction between energetic outflows and the surrounding medium paves the way for future focused multiwavelength observations and dedicated numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Subhalos and Higher Order Catastrophes in Gravitational Wave Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is an invaluable probe of the nature of dark matter, and the structures it forms. Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for unparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to the precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of the entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly lensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos: \emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative magnification ($\mu_r &gt; 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the caustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for $\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models, and \emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images, which occur for $\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find that these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in our simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of low-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in lensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction integral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We also report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the distributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo populations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the upcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based detectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide insight into the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Stellar structures, molecular gas, and star formation across the PHANGS sample of nearby galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify stellar structures in the PHANGS sample of 74 nearby galaxies and construct morphological masks of sub-galactic environments based on Spitzer 3.6 micron images. At the simplest level, we distinguish centres, bars, spiral arms, interarm and discs without strong spirals. Slightly more sophisticated masks include rings and lenses, publicly released but not explicitly used in this paper. We examine trends using PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) intensity maps and tracers of star formation. The interarm regions and discs without strong spirals dominate in area, whereas molecular gas and star formation are quite evenly distributed among the five basic environments. We reproduce the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation with a slope compatible with unity within the uncertainties, without significant slope differences among environments. In contrast to early studies, we find that bars are not always deserts devoid of gas and star formation, but instead they show large diversity. Similarly, spiral arms do not account for most of the gas and star formation in disc galaxies, and they do not have shorter depletion times than the interarm regions. Spiral arms accumulate gas and star formation, without systematically boosting the star formation efficiency. Centres harbour remarkably high surface densities and on average shorter depletion times than other environments. Centres of barred galaxies show higher surface densities and wider distributions compared to the outer disc; yet, depletion times are similar to unbarred galaxies, suggesting highly intermittent periods of star formation when bars episodically drive gas inflow, without enhancing the central star formation efficiency permanently. In conclusion, we provide quantitative evidence that stellar structures in galaxies strongly affect the organisation of molecular gas and star formation, but their impact on star formation efficiency is more subtle.</description>

      <title>Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in EAGLE: lifetimes and longevity of misaligned galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dominant processes by which galaxies replenish their cold gas reservoirs remain disputed, especially in massive galaxies. Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments offer an opportunity to study these replenishment processes. However, observed distributions of these misalignments conflict with current models of gas replenishment in early-type galaxies (ETGs), with longer relaxation timescales suggested as a possible solution. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the relaxation of unstable misaligned gas in galaxies with masses of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We extract misalignments from formation to relaxation providing a sample of $\sim3200$ relaxations. We find relaxation timescales tend to be short-duration, with median lifetimes of $\sim0.5$ Gyr, though with a notable population of unstable misalignments lasting $\gtrsim1$ Gyr. Relaxation time distributions show a log-linear relationship, with $\approx20$ per cent of unstable misalignments persisting for $\gtrsim3$ torquing times. Long-lived unstable misalignments are predominantly found in galaxies with higher stellar masses, lower star-forming gas fractions, higher ongoing gas inflow, and which reside in the centres of dense environments. Mergers only cause $\approx10$ per cent of unstable misalignments among galaxies at $z&lt;0.35$, and $\approx21$ per cent at $0.35&lt;z&lt;1.0$ in EAGLE. We conclude that, at least in EAGLE, unstable kinematic misalignments are not predominantly driven by gas-rich minor mergers at any redshift probed. Additionally, processes that significantly extend relaxation times are not dominant in the galaxy population. Instead, we see a diverse formation pathway for misalignments such as through hot halo cooling.</description>

      <title>Do tides play a role in the determination of the pre-stellar core mass function?</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have examined the role of tides in the star formation process. They suggest, notably, that the tides determine the characteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by preventing the collapse of density fluctuations that would become gravitationally unstable in the absence of the tidal field generated by a neighboring central mass. However, most of these studies consider the tidal collapse condition as a 1D process or use a scalar virial condition and thus neglect the anisotropy of the tidal field and its compressive effects. In the present paper, we consider a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the envelope of a central core. This perturbation is subject to a tidal field generated by the central core. We study its evolution taking dynamical effects and the anisotropy of the tides into account. Based on the general tensorial virial equations, we determine a new collapse condition that takes these mechanisms into account. We identify two regimes: (i) a weak tidal regime in which the dynamics of the perturbation is only slightly modified by the action of the tides and (ii) a strong tidal regime in which the density threshold for collapse can potentially be increased due to the combined effects of the tides and the rotational support generated by the tidal synchronization of the perturbation with the orbital motion. In the case of a turbulence-induced density perturbation formed in the vicinity of a first Larson core, we show that the density threshold above which the perturbation collapses is increased only for low-mass perturbations (less than 2.7 solar mass) and only by at most a factor of 1.5. We conclude that tides likely do not play a major role in the process of star formation or in the determination of the characteristic mass of the IMF. We propose an alternative explanation for the observed value of the characteristic mass of the IMF.</description>

      <title>Disturbed cold gas in galaxy and structure formation</title>

Abstract: Cold and cool gas (T $\leq 10^4$ K) in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and its interaction with galaxies remain poorly understood. Simulations predict that cold gas flows into galaxies through cosmic filaments, determining the disk formation and galaxy evolution. The cold gas accretion modes in the CGM and their dependence on dark matter halo mass and redshift remain puzzling. Resolving the kiloparsec-scale kinematics and dynamics of cold gas interacting with the disk, dust, and metals in different environments is particularly lacking at z &gt; 2. Here we report two disturbed cold gas structures traced by ultra-strong MgII absorbers (rest-frame equivalent width Wr &gt; 2 \AA) exhibiting high kinematic velocities (&gt; 500 km/s) and their environments at z ~ 4.9 and z ~ 2.6. Observations were conducted with VLT/MUSE, JWST/NIRCam, and ALMA to detect Lya and nebular emission lines, as well as dust continuum emission in the vicinity of these two absorbing gas structures. We identify two Lya emitters associated with a strong MgII absorber pair separated by ~1000 km/s at z~ 4.87. The pair exhibits relative differences in metallicity, dust content, and ionization states, suggesting internal metal and dust exchange within the ultra-large cold gas structure. For the strong MgII absorber at z = 2.5652, we detect a dusty star-forming galaxy at a projected distance of $D = 38$ kpc. This galaxy exhibits prominent HeI, [SIII], and Paschen$\gamma$ lines, along with significant dust continuum. It has a star formation rate of ~ 121 +/- 33 $M_{\odot}$/yr and likely harbors a rotating disk. These findings tentatively suggest that cold gas at high redshifts plays a critical role in driving disk formation and actively participates in the transfer of metals and dust within the overdense regions of the CGM.</description>

      <title>Where are the Population III star relics in the simulated Milky Way analogues?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using 6 Milky Way analogues with two different numerical resolutions from the Auriga simulation, we investigate the total mass, spatial distribution and kinematics of the Population III star relics in the Milky Way analogues at $z=0$. These relics (primarily second generation stars) formed over a wide redshift range, from about $z=22$ to $z=4$, with an average formation redshift of $z \sim 10.0$, and comprise about $2\times10^{-5}$ of the entire galactic stellar population. The disk and bulge components host only a small fraction of these relics, contributing less than $12$ percent in total. The stellar halo, in particular the outer stellar halo of which galactic radius $r&gt;30$ kpc, hosts the largest fraction (about 46 percent on average), with an average of one relic star for per $4,000$ to $10,000$ stars, making it a promising region for observational searches. Additionally, around $18$ percent of the Population III star relics are found in satellite galaxies, with smaller and older satellite galaxies tending to contain a higher proportion of these stars. Thus, low-mass and early-formed satellite galaxies are also ideal targets for finding such relics, although some satellite galaxies may lack them entirely. The spatial distribution and kinematics of these stars show good numerical convergence across different simulation resolutions. Our results provide valuable guidance for searches of the Population III star relics and offer insights for interpreting findings from ongoing and future stellar archaeology surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in the task of wide binary classification. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments in EAGLE: enhanced SMBH growth in misaligned galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in $\sim11\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0&lt;z&lt;1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.</description>

      <title>Insights for Early Massive Black Hole Growth from JWST Detection of the [Ne v] {\lambda}3427 Emission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line detected in the recently published JWST spectra of two galaxies, at z = 6.9 and 5.6, to study the key properties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in their centers. Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line emission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly complete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z &gt; 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order L_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems is Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH&gt;10^7 M_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated from dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied BH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably higher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the general trend seen in some other z &gt; 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the [Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection of the [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line at z &gt; 5 would translate to similarly high AGN luminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for studying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured sources.</description>

      <title>LAP1-B is the First Observed System Consistent with Theoretical Predictions for Population III Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Nakajima et al. (2025) presented James Webb Space Telescope observations of the $z=6.6$ Population III (Pop III) candidate LAP1-B, which is gravitationally lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416. We argue that this is the first object to agree with three key theoretical predictions for Pop III stars: (1) formation in extremely low-metallicity halos with virial temperatures ranging from $T_{\rm vir}\sim 10^3-10^4~{\rm K}$, (2) a top-heavy initial mass function, and (3) formation of low-mass clusters with ${\sim}{\rm a ~few}\times 1000~M_\odot$ in massive Pop III stars. LAP1-B is consistent with recently formed Pop III stars hosted in a $\sim 5\times 10^7~M_\odot$ dark matter halo, some of which have enriched their surrounding gas either with supernovae or stellar winds. We use the semi-analytic model of Visbal et al. (2020) to predict the abundance of Pop III clusters observable at the high magnification provided by the foreground galaxy cluster MACS J0416. Using fiducial parameters unmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy similar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic abundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because of their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which would host fewer stars. Thus, we find that LAP1-B was found at the redshift theoretically expected, given current observable limits, despite the fact that most Pop III systems form much earlier.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-halo internal alignments across cosmic time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigations of intrinsic alignments suggest a link between the alignment of a central galaxy's major axis with the galaxy distribution and its internal galaxy-halo shape alignment. In contrast, blue central galaxies typically exhibit almost no alignment signal, owing to a stronger internal misalignment with their halo. We investigated how the internal alignment between the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components evolves over time as a function of the total mass of central galaxies at z=0. In particular, we aim to understand why disk-dominated, blue central galaxies often show weak or absent alignment signals with the galaxy distribution in their group and in the larger-scale cosmic structure. We used data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 run and selected a sample of bright central galaxies at z=0. We computed the principal axes of the stellar and dark matter components, along with their angular momenta, to obtain the various alignment angles analyzed in this study. Also, we used the merger trees to determine the number of major mergers between z=20 and z=0, and to track their shapes along their main branch. We examined secondary dependencies of the galaxy-halo alignment on properties such as color and merger history. We analyzed how shape alignments relate to the dynamical coupling between the angular momentum directions of the stellar and dark matter components. The results show that massive centrals tend to align with the shape of their inner halo, and they are typically red and have undergone numerous mergers. Lower-mass red centrals, and those that have experienced many mergers exhibit the strongest evolution toward alignment. Blue centrals, in contrast, are more strongly influenced by the link between the stellar and dark matter angular momenta, such that they evolve toward either alignment or misalignment with both the shape and angular momentum of the inner halo.</description>

      <title>Inferring Stellar Densities with Flexible Models I: The Distribution of RR Lyrae in the Milky Way with $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way requires detailed mapping of its stellar components, which preserve fossil records of the Galaxy's assembly through cosmic time. RR Lyrae stars are particularly well-suited for this endeavor, as they are old, standard candle variables that probe the Galaxy's earliest formation epochs. In this work, we employ a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the three-dimensional density distribution of RR Lyrae stars in the Milky Way. This approach provides a flexible framework for modeling complex stellar distributions, particularly in the inner Galaxy where the bulge, disk, and halo components overlap. Our analysis reveals that the inner Galaxy is dominated by a distinct prolate stellar population with axis ratio $q$=1.31. Consistent with previous work, we find the halo follows a $r^{-4}$ power-law profile that flattens within 12 kpc of the Galactic center. We also confirm the halo is oblate ($q$=0.70) with a tilt angle of $18^{\circ}$. We report for the first time that this tilt aligns the halo major axis in the direction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. These results establish GMMs as an effective and flexible tool for modeling Galactic structure and provide new constraints on the distribution of old stars in the inner Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: We present ALMA CO observations of 14 HI-detected galaxies from the CHILES survey found in a cosmic over-density at z~0.12. This is the largest collection of spatially resolved CO + HI observations beyond the local Universe (z&gt;0.05) to date. While the HI-detected parent sample spans a range of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR), and environments, we only directly detect CO in the highest stellar mass galaxies, log(M_*/M_Sun)&gt;10.0, with SFRs greater than ~2 M_Sun/yr. The detected CO has the kinematic signature of a rotating disk, consistent with the HI. We stack the CO non-detections and find a mean H_2 mass of log(M_H2/M_Sun) = 8.46 in galaxies with a mean stellar mass of log(M_*/M_Sun) = 9.35. In addition to high stellar masses and SFRs, the systems detected in CO are spatially larger, have redder overall colors, and exhibit broader (stacked) line widths. The CO emission is spatially coincident with both the highest stellar mass surface density and star forming region of the galaxies, as revealed by the 1.4 GHz continuum emission. We interpret the redder colors as the molecular gas being coincident with dusty regions of obscured star formation. The 14 HI detections show a range of morphologies, but the HI reservoir is always more extended than the CO. Finally, we compare with samples in the literature and find mild evidence for evolution in the molecular gas reservoir and H_2-to-HI gas ratio with redshift in HI flux-limited samples. We show that the scatter in the HI, and HI-to-stellar mass ratio is too great to conclusively measure evolution below z=0.2, and is even extremely difficult below z=0.4. Detections from CHILES are likely to be the only individual galaxies detected in HI between 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.23 for the foreseeable future due to the severity of satellite radio frequency interference, and its preferential impact on short baselines which dominate contemporary HI surveys.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational lensing to probe for bright quintessential galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of the first generation of galaxies is an ongoing challenge in observational astrophysics. While advances in deep field observation have led to the identification of large numbers of galaxies within the Epoch of Reionization, there are very few observed galaxies at this range that are sufficiently bright for high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. To this end, we analyse HST and ground-based photometry of five candidate strongly lensed galaxies, all projected behind the cores of massive clusters and with similarly red optical-NIR colors. All are characterized by a drop-off in their spectra between the near-infrared and optical wavelengths, corresponding to a Lyman-break that sets a lower bound on their redshifts. Using the open-source SED modeling software Prospector, we characterize two of these galaxies as high-z (z $\sim$ 6.5-7) while the other three are low-z (z $\sim$ 2) despite all five having similar apparent magnitudes at the observed wavelengths. We demonstrate that for the brightest dropout candidates we can distinguish high-z galaxies from red or dusty low-z galaxies using limited photometric data. The bright sources enable deep constraints on the dropout color which, in combination with flat continua measured in redder bands, require high-z solutions when searching the parameter space. At the time of writing this work significantly increases the number of m_AB &lt; 24 galaxies at or above a redshift of 6, and provides a path forward for future analysis on the early era of galaxy formation</description>

      <title>The Dependency of Bar Formation Timescale on Disk Mass Fraction, Toomre $Q$, and Scale Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as "Fujii relation"), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre $Q$ (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre $Q$, and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre $Q$ and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre $Q$ and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from $0.20_{-0.06}^{+0.09}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $12.20_{-2.80}^{+3.37}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.</description>

      <title>The X-ray$-$UV Luminosity Relation of eROSITA Quasars</title>

Abstract: The non-linear relation between the UV and X-ray luminosity in quasars has been studied for decades. However, as we lack a comprehensive model able to explain it, its investigation still relies on observational efforts. This work focuses on optically selected quasars detected by eROSITA. We present the properties of the sources collected in the eROSITA early data release (eFEDS) and those resulting from the first six months of eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). We focus on the subset of quasars bright enough in the optical/UV band to avoid an ''Eddington bias'' towards X-ray brighter-than-average spectral energy distributions. The final samples include 1,248 and 519 sources for eFEDS and eRASS1, up to redshift $z\approx3$ and $z\approx1.5$, respectively. We found that the X-ray$-$UV luminosity relation shows no significant evolution with redshift, and its slope is in perfect agreement with previous compilations of quasar samples. The intrinsic dispersion of the relation is about 0.2 dex, which is small enough for possible cosmological applications. However, the limited redshift range and statistics of the current samples do not allow us to obtain significant cosmological constraints yet. We show how this is going to change with the future releases of the eROSITA data.</description>

      <title>NGC 2392 and NGC 4361: Spectroscopic Diagnostics of Planetary Nebula Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study presents a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC~2392 and NGC~4361 using optical spectra obtained from the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) and mid-infrared spectra from archival \textit{Spitzer} IRS data. The physical conditions, such as electron temperature ($T_e$) and density ($n_e$), were derived using diagnostic emission lines through the PyNeb software. Elemental abundances of key species, including He, O, N, Ne, S, Cl, and Ar, were determined for both nebulae, offering insights into their nucleosynthesis history and evolutionary status. High-resolution HST and Pan-STARRS imaging further elucidate the morphological structures of the nebulae. NGC~2392 exhibits a well-defined double-shell structure and moderate excitation characteristics, while NGC~4361 displays a diffuse elliptical morphology with high-excitation conditions and a notably low nitrogen content. The observed line spectra and derived abundances point toward distinct progenitor histories for the two PNe, with NGC~2392 originating from a younger, intermediate-mass progenitor, while NGC~4361 traces an older, metal-poor Population II star. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the evolution and chemical enrichment processes of low- to intermediate-mass stars.</description>
