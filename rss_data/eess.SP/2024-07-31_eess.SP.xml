      <title>How Homogenizing the Channel-wise Magnitude Can Enhance EEG Classification Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant challenge in the electroencephalogram EEG lies in the fact that current data representations involve multiple electrode signals, resulting in data redundancy and dominant lead information. However extensive research conducted on EEG classification focuses on designing model architectures without tackling the underlying issues. Otherwise, there has been a notable gap in addressing data preprocessing for EEG, leading to considerable computational overhead in Deep Learning (DL) processes. In light of these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach for EEG data pre-processing. Our method first transforms the EEG data into an encoded image by an Inverted Channel-wise Magnitude Homogenization (ICWMH) to mitigate inter-channel biases. Next, we apply the edge detection technique on the EEG-encoded image combined with skip connection to emphasize the most significant transitions in the data while preserving structural and invariant information. By doing so, we can improve the EEG learning process efficiently without using a huge DL network. Our experimental evaluations reveal that we can significantly improve (i.e., from 2% to 5%) over current baselines.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Geometry-Based EEG Approaches: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Riemannian geometry in the decoding of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has swiftly garnered attention because of its straightforwardness, precision, and resilience, along with its aptitude for transfer learning, which has been demonstrated through significant achievements in global BCI competitions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the integration of deep learning with Riemannian geometry to enhance EEG signal decoding in BCIs. Our review updates the findings since the last major review in 2017, comparing modern approaches that utilize deep learning to improve the handling of non-Euclidean data structures inherent in EEG signals. We discuss how these approaches not only tackle the traditional challenges of noise sensitivity, non-stationarity, and lengthy calibration times but also introduce novel classification frameworks and signal processing techniques to reduce these limitations significantly. Furthermore, we identify current shortcomings and propose future research directions in manifold learning and riemannian-based classification, focusing on practical implementations and theoretical expansions, such as feature tracking on manifolds, multitask learning, feature extraction, and transfer learning. This review aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical, real-world applications, making sophisticated mathematical approaches accessible and actionable for BCI enhancements.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty-aware Deep Learning Framework-based Robust Design Optimization of Metamaterial Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials represent an innovative class of artificial structures, distinguished by their extraordinary mechanical characteristics, which are beyond the scope of traditional natural materials. The use of deep generative models has become increasingly popular in the design of metamaterial units. The effectiveness of using deep generative models lies in their capacity to compress complex input data into a simplified, lower-dimensional latent space, while also enabling the creation of novel optimal designs through sampling within this space. However, the design process does not take into account the effect of model uncertainty due to data sparsity or the effect of input data uncertainty due to inherent randomness in the data. This might lead to the generation of undesirable structures with high sensitivity to the uncertainties in the system. To address this issue, a novel uncertainty-aware deep learning framework-based robust design approach is proposed for the design of metamaterial units with optimal target properties. The proposed approach utilizes the probabilistic nature of the deep learning framework and quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties associated with surrogate-based design optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed design approach is capable of designing high-performance metamaterial units with high reliability. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed design approach, a single-objective design optimization problem and a multi-objective design optimization problem are presented. The optimal robust designs obtained are validated by comparing them to the designs obtained from the topology optimization method as well as the designs obtained from a deterministic deep learning framework-based design optimization where none of the uncertainties in the system are explicitly considered.</description>

      <title>Power Measurement Enabled Channel Autocorrelation Matrix Estimation for IRS-Assisted Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By reconfiguring wireless channels via passive signal reflection, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can bring significant performance enhancement for wireless communication systems. However, such performance improvement generally relies on the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) for IRS-involved links. Prior works on IRS CSI acquisition mainly estimate IRS-cascaded channels based on the extra pilot signals received at the users/base station (BS) with time-varying IRS reflections, which, however, needs to modify the existing channel training/estimation protocols of wireless systems. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a new channel estimation scheme for IRS-assisted communication systems based on the received signal power measured at the user terminal, which is practically attainable without the need of changing the current protocol. Due to the lack of signal phase information in measured power, the autocorrelation matrix of the BS-IRS-user cascaded channel is estimated by solving an equivalent rank-minimization problem. To this end, a low-rank-approaching (LRA) algorithm is proposed by employing the fractional programming and alternating optimization techniques. To reduce computational complexity, an approximate LRA (ALRA) algorithm is also developed. Furthermore, these two algorithms are extended to be robust against the receiver noise and quantization error in power measurement. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation algorithms as well as the IRS passive reflection design based on the estimated channel autocorrelation matrix.</description>

      <title>Improving EEG Classification Through Randomly Reassembling Original and Generated Data with Transformer-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) classification has been widely used in various medical and engineering applications, where it is important for understanding brain function, diagnosing diseases, and assessing mental health conditions. However, the scarcity of EEG data severely restricts the performance of EEG classification networks, and generative model-based data augmentation methods emerging as potential solutions to overcome this challenge. There are two problems with existing such methods: (1) The quality of the generated EEG signals is not high. (2) The enhancement of EEG classification networks is not effective. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based denoising diffusion probabilistic model and a generated data-based data augmentation method to address the above two problems. For the characteristics of EEG signals, we propose a constant-factor scaling method to preprocess the signals, which reduces the loss of information. We incorporated Multi-Scale Convolution and Dynamic Fourier Spectrum Information modules into the model, improving the stability of the training process and the quality of the generated data. The proposed augmentation method randomly reassemble the generated data with original data in the time-domain to obtain vicinal data, which improves the model performance by minimizing the empirical risk and the vicinal risk. We experiment the proposed augmentation method on five EEG datasets for four tasks and observe significant accuracy performance improvements: 14.00% on the Bonn dataset; 25.83% on the New Delhi epilepsy dataset; 4.98% on the SleepEDF-20 dataset; 9.42% on the FACED dataset; 2.5% on the Shu dataset. We intend to make the code of our method publicly accessible shortly</description>

      <title>EEGMamba: Bidirectional State Space Models with Mixture of Experts for EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, with the development of deep learning, electroencephalogram (EEG) classification networks have achieved certain progress. Transformer-based models can perform well in capturing long-term dependencies in EEG signals. However, their quadratic computational complexity leads to significant computational overhead. Moreover, most EEG classification models are only suitable for single tasks, showing poor generalization capabilities across different tasks and further unable to handle EEG data from various tasks simultaneously due to variations in signal length and the number of channels. In this paper, we introduce a universal EEG classification network named EEGMamba, which seamlessly integrates the Spatio-Temporal-Adaptive (ST-Adaptive) module, Bidirectional Mamba, and Mixture of Experts (MoE) into a unified framework for multiple tasks. The proposed ST-Adaptive module performs unified feature extraction on EEG signals of different lengths and channel counts through spatio-adaptive convolution and incorporates a class token to achieve temporal-adaptability. Moreover, we design a bidirectional Mamba particularly suitable for EEG signals for further feature extraction, balancing high accuracy and fast inference speed in processing long EEG signals. In order to better process EEG data for different tasks, we introduce Task-aware MoE with a universal expert, achieving the capture of both differences and commonalities between EEG data from different tasks. We test our model on eight publicly available EEG datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in four types of tasks: seizure detection, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, and motor imagery. The code is set to be released soon.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Flexible Deep Learning Method for Signal Delineation via Keypoints Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) methods have been used for electrocardiogram (ECG) processing in a wide variety of tasks, demonstrating good performance compared with traditional signal processing algorithms. These methods offer an efficient framework with a limited need for apriori data pre-processing and feature engineering. While several studies use this approach for ECG signal delineation, a significant gap persists between the expected and the actual outcome. Existing methods rely on a sample-to-sample classifier. However, the clinical expected outcome consists of a set of onset, offset, and peak for the different waves that compose each R-R interval. To align the actual with the expected output, it is necessary to incorporate post-processing algorithms. This counteracts two of the main advantages of DL models, since these algorithms are based on assumptions and slow down the method's performance. In this paper, we present Keypoint Estimation for Electrocardiogram Delineation (KEED), a novel DL model designed for keypoint estimation, which organically offers an output aligned with clinical expectations. By standing apart from the conventional sample-to-sample classifier, we achieve two benefits: (i) Eliminate the need for additional post-processing, and (ii) Establish a flexible framework that allows the adjustment of the threshold value considering the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff regarding the particular clinical requirements. The proposed method's performance is compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) signal processing methods. Remarkably, KEED significantly outperforms despite being optimized with an extremely limited annotated data. In addition, KEED decreases the inference time by a factor ranging from 52x to 703x.</description>

      <title>Beam Focusing for Near-Field Multi-User Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays are poised to play a pivotal role in sixth-generation (6G) networks. Utilizing such arrays often results in a near-field spherical wave transmission environment, enabling the generation of focused beams, which introduces new degrees of freedom for wireless localization. In this paper, we consider a beam-focusing design for localizing multiple sources in the radiating near-field. Our formulation accommodates various expected types of implementations of large antenna arrays, including hybrid analog/digital architectures and dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs). We consider a direct localization estimation method exploiting curvature-of-arrival of impinging spherical wavefront to obtain user positions. In this regard, we adopt a two-stage approach configuring the array to optimize near-field positioning. In the first step, we focus only on adjusting the array coefficients to minimize the estimation error. We obtain a closed-form approximate solution based on projection and the better one based on the Riemann gradient algorithm. We then extend this approach to simultaneously localize and focus the beams via a sub-optimal iterative approach that does not rely on such knowledge. The simulation results show that near-field localization accuracy based on a hybrid array or DMA can achieve performance close to that of fully digital arrays at a lower cost, and DMAs can attain better performance than hybrid solutions with the same aperture.</description>

      <title>Movable Frequency Diverse Array-Assisted Covert Communication With Multiple Wardens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency diverse array (FDA) is highly promising for improving covert communication performance by adjusting the frequency of each antenna at the transmitter. However, when faced with the cases of multiple wardens and highly correlated channels, FDA is limited by the frequency constraint and cannot provide satisfactory covert performance. In this paper, we propose a novel movable FDA (MFDA) antenna technology where positions of the antennas can be dynamically adjusted in a given finite region. Specifically, we aim to maximize the covert rate by jointly optimizing the antenna beamforming vector, antenna frequency vector and antenna position vector. To solve this non-convex optimization problem with coupled variables, we develop a two-stage alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method. Moreover, considering the challenge of obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) at multiple wardens, we study the case of imperfect CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that MFDA can significantly enhance covert performance compared to the conventional FDA. In particular, when the frequency constraint is strict, MFDA can further increase the covert rate by adjusting the positions of antennas instead of the frequencies.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Improvement of Rank-Ordered Mean Algorithm in Single-Photon LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth estimation using a single-photon LiDAR is often solved by a matched filter. It is, however, error-prone in the presence of background noise. A commonly used technique to reject background noise is the rank-ordered mean (ROM) filter previously reported by Shin \textit{et al.} (2015). ROM rejects noisy photon arrival timestamps by selecting only a small range of them around the median statistics within its local neighborhood. Despite the promising performance of ROM, its theoretical performance limit is unknown. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the ROM performance by showing that ROM fails when the reflectivity drops below a threshold predetermined by the depth and signal-to-background ratio, and its accuracy undergoes a phase transition at the cutoff. Based on our theory, we propose an improved signal extraction technique by selecting tight timestamp clusters. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves depth estimation performance over ROM by 3 orders of magnitude at the same signal intensities, and achieves high image fidelity at noise levels as high as 17 times that of signal.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS via Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the channel estimation problem for beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) from a tensor decomposition perspective. We first show that the received pilot signals can be arranged as a three-way tensor, allowing us to recast the cascaded channel estimation problem as a block Tucker decomposition problem that yields decoupled estimates for the involved channel matrices while offering a substantial performance gain over the conventional (matrix-based) least squares (LS) estimation method. More specifically, we develop two solutions to solve the problem. The first one is a closed-form solution that extracts the channel estimates via a block Tucker Kronecker factorization (BTKF), which boils down to solving a set of parallel rank-one matrix approximation problems. Exploiting such a low-rank property yields a noise rejection gain compared to the standard LS estimation scheme while allowing the two involved channels to be estimated separately. The second solution is based on a block Tucker alternating least squares (BTALS) algorithm that directly estimates the involved channel matrices using an iterative estimation procedure. We discuss the uniqueness and identifiability issues and their implications for training design. We also propose a tensor-based design of the BD-RIS training tensor for each algorithm that ensures unique decoupled channel estimates under trivial scaling ambiguities. Our numerical results shed light on the tradeoffs offered by BTKF and BTALS methods. Specifically, while the first enjoys fast and parallel extraction of the channel estimates in closed form, the second has a more flexible training design, allowing for a significantly reduced training overhead compared to the state-of-the-art LS method.</description>

      <title>Single-BS Simultaneous Environment Sensing and UE Localization without LoS Path by Exploiting Near-Field Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the mobile communication network evolves over the past few decades, localizing user equipment (UE) has become an important network service. While localization in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios has reached a level of maturity, it is known that in far-field scenarios without a LoS path nor any prior information about the scatterers, accurately localizing the UE is impossible. In this letter, we show that this becomes possible if there are scatterers in the near-field region of the base station (BS) antenna arrays. Specifically, by exploiting the additional distance sensing capability of extremely large-scale antenna arrays (XL-arrays) provided by near-field effects, we propose a novel method that simultaneously performs environment sensing and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) UE localization using one single BS. In the proposed method, the BS leverages the near-field characteristics of XL-arrays to directly estimate the locations of the near-field scatterers with array signal processing, which then serves as virtual anchors for UE localization. Then, the propagation delay for each path is estimated and the position of the UE is obtained based on the positions of scatterers and the path delays. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and robustness with similar complexity compared with benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Optimization approach for Ultrasound Shear Wave Speed Estimation with Time-Lateral Plane Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) is a noninvasive way to measure stiffness of soft tissue for medical diagnosis. In SWE imaging, an acoustic radiation force induces tissue displacement, which creates shear waves (SWs) that travel laterally through the medium. Finding the lateral arrival times of SWs at different tissue locations helps figure out the shear wave speed (SWS), which is directly linked to the stiffness of the medium. Traditional SWS estimation techniques, however, are not noise resilient enough handling noise and reflection artifacts filled data. This paper proposes new techniques to estimate SWS in both time and frequency domains. These new methods optimize a loss function that is based on the lateral signal shift parameter between known locations and is constrained by neighborhood displacement group shift determined from the time-lateral plane-denoised SW propagation data. The proposed constrained optimization is formed by coupling losses of local particles with a Gaussian kernel giving an optimum arrival time for the center particle by enforcing stiffness homogeneity in a small neighborhood to enable inherent noise resilience. The denoising scheme involves isolating the transitioning SW profile in each time-lateral plane, creating a parameterized mask. Moreover, lateral interpolation is performed to enhance reconstruction resolution and obtain increased displacement groups to enhance the reliability of the optimization. The proposed noise robust scheme is tested on a simulation and three experimental datasets. The performance of the method is compared with 3 ToF and 2 frequency-domain methods. The evaluations show visually and quantitatively superior and noise-robust reconstructions compared to state-of-the-art methods. Due to its high contrast and minimal error, the proposed technique can find its application in tissue health inspection and cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>RIP sensing matrices construction for sparsifying dictionaries with application to MRI imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical applications of compressed sensing often restrict the choice of its two main ingredients. They may (i) prescribe using particular redundant dictionaries for certain classes of signals to become sparsely represented, or (ii) dictate specific measurement mechanisms which exploit certain physical principles. On the problem of RIP measurement matrix design in compressed sensing with redundant dictionaries, we give a simple construction to derive sensing matrices whose compositions with a prescribed dictionary have a high probability of the RIP in the $k \log(n/k)$ regime. Our construction thus provides recovery guarantees usually only attainable for sensing matrices from random ensembles with sparsifying orthonormal bases. Moreover, we use the dictionary factorization idea that our construction rests on in the application of magnetic resonance imaging, in which also the sensing matrix is prescribed by quantum mechanical principles. We propose a recovery algorithm based on transforming the acquired measurements such that the compressed sensing theory for RIP embeddings can be utilized to recover wavelet coefficients of the target image, and show its performance on examples from the fastMRI dataset.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation for Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Systems Enabled by Integrated Super-resolution Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated super-resolution sensing and communication (ISSAC) has emerged as a promising technology to achieve extremely high precision sensing for those key parameters, such as the angles of the sensing targets. In this paper, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme enabled by ISSAC for millimeter wave (mmWave) and TeraHertz (THz) systems with a hybrid analog/digital beamforming architecture, where both the pilot overhead and the cost of radio frequency (RF) chains are significantly reduced. The key idea is to exploit the fact that subspace-based super-resolution algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) can estimate channel parameters accurately without requiring dedicate a priori known pilots. In particular, the proposed method consists of two stages. First, the angles of the multi-path channel components are estimated in a pilot-free manner during the transmission of data symbols. Second, the multi-path channel coefficients are estimated with very few pilots. Compared to conventional channel estimation schemes that rely solely on channel training, our approach requires the estimation of much fewer parameters in the second stage. Furthermore, with channel multi-path angles obtained, the beamforming gain can be achieved when pilots are sent to estimate the channel path gains. To comprehensively investigate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider both the basic line-of-sight (LoS) channels and more general multi-path channels. We compare the performance of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) of channel estimation and the resulting beamforming gains of our proposed scheme with the traditional scheme that rely exclusively on channel training. It is demonstrated that our proposed method significantly outperforms the benchmarking scheme. Simulation results are presented to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Communication for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperative perception plays a crucial role in autonomous driving scenarios. Despite its potential to improve perception accuracy and robustness, the large amount of raw sensor data inevitably results in high communication overhead. To mitigate this issue, we propose TOCOM-V2I, a task-oriented communication framework for V2I cooperative perception, which reduces bandwidth consumption by transmitting only task-relevant information, instead of the raw data stream, for perceiving the surrounding environment. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a spatial-aware feature selection module to filter out irrelevant information based on spatial relationships and perceptual prior. Second, we introduce a hierarchical entropy model to exploit redundancy within the features for efficient compression and transmission. Finally, we utilize a scaled dot-product attention architecture to fuse vehicle-side and infrastructure-side features to improve perception performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TOCOM-V2I.</description>

      <title>Toward Wireless Localization Using Multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the capabilities and effectiveness of backward sensing centered on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We demonstrate that the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation of incident waves in the far-field regime can be accomplished using a single RIS by leveraging configurational diversity. Furthermore, we identify that the spatial diversity achieved through deploying multiple RISs enables accurate localization of multiple power sources. Physically accurate and mathematically concise models are introduced to characterize forward signal aggregations via RISs. By employing linearized approximations inherent in the far-field region, the measurement process for various configurations can be expressed as a system of linear equations. The mathematical essence of backward sensing lies in solving this system. A theoretical framework for determining key performance indicators is established through condition number analysis of the sensing operators. In the context of localization using multiple RISs, we examine relationships among the rank of sensing operators, the size of the region of interest (RoI), and the number of elements and measurements. For DoA estimations, we provide an upper bound for the relative error of the least squares reconstruction algorithm. These quantitative analyses offer essential insights for system design and optimization. Numerical experiments validate our findings. To demonstrate the practicality of our proposed RIS-centric sensing approach, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype using universal software radio peripherals (USRP) and employ a magnitude-only reconstruction algorithm tailored for this system. To our knowledge, this represents the first trial of its kind.</description>

      <title>Edge Learning Based Collaborative Automatic Modulation Classification for Hierarchical Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hierarchical cognitive radio networks, edge or cloud servers utilize the data collected by edge devices for modulation classification, which, however, is faced with problems of the computation load, transmission overhead, and data privacy. In this article, an edge learning (EL) based framework jointly mobilizing the edge device and the edge server for intelligent co-inference is proposed to realize the collaborative automatic modulation classification (C-AMC) between them. A spectrum semantic compression neural network is designed for the edge device to compress the collected raw data into a compact semantic embedding that is then sent to the edge server via the wireless channel. On the edge server side, a modulation classification neural network combining the bidirectional long-short term memory and attention structures is elaborated to determine the modulation type from the noisy semantic embedding. The C-AMC framework decently balances the computation resources of both sides while avoiding the high transmission overhead and data privacy leakage. Both the offline and online training procedures of the C-AMC framework are elaborated. The compression strategy of the C-AMC framework is also developed to further facilitate the deployment, especially for the resource-constrained edge device. Simulation results show the superiority of the EL-based C-AMC framework in terms of the classification accuracy, computational complexity, and the data compression rate as well as reveal useful insights paving the practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Detecting $\sim$10 mK Face Temperature Change Based on Lock-in Thermography Referencing Heartbeat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared thermography, which has widely spread particularly during the COVID-19 period, has been effectively used for research on health monitoring and emotion estimation. Nevertheless, detecting minute temperature changes with thermography is challenging as it is disturbed by not only noise but also outside temperature surrounding the object. In this study, we demonstrate detecting face temperature variation by implementing lock-in thermography using heartbeat signals as a reference. It allows us to detect minute temperature changes, as low as $\sim$10 mK, on the forehead with a commercially available thermal camera. The proposed approach enables stable measurement of body temperature variation, showing potential for non-contact emotion estimation.</description>

      <title>Advanced ISAC Design: Movable Antennas and Accounting for Dynamic RCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to enhance system performance. Unlike the existing ISAC literature, we account for dynamic radar cross-section (RCS) variations. Chance constraints are introduced and integrated into the sensing quality of service (QoS) framework to precisely control the impact of the resulting RCS uncertainties. Taking into account the dynamic nature of the RCS, we jointly optimize the MA positions and the communication and sensing beam design for minimization of the total transmit power at the base station (BS) while ensuring the individual communication and sensing task QoS requirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), we develop an iterative algorithm to obtain a high quality suboptimal solution. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-enhanced ISAC system cannot only significantly reduce the BS transmit power compared to systems relying on fixed antenna positions and antenna selection but also demonstrates remarkable robustness to RCS fluctuations, underscoring the multifaceted benefits of exploiting MAs in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Hardware Limitations of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in the Uplink: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) have emerged as promising candidates for basestation deployment in the next generation of wireless communications. While overlooking the practical and hardware limitations of DMA, previous studies have highlighted DMAs' potential to deliver high data rates while maintaining low power consumption. In this paper, we address this oversight by analyzing the impact of practical hardware limitations such as antenna efficiency, power consumed in required components, processing limitations, etc. Specifically, we investigate DMA-assisted wireless communications in the uplink and propose a model which accounts for these hardware limitations. To do so, we propose a concise model to characterize the power consumption of a DMA. For a fair assessment, we propose a wave-domain combiner, based on holography theory, to maximize the achievable sum rate of DMA-assisted antennas. We compare the achievable sum rate and energy efficiency of DMA antennas with that of a partially connected hybrid phased array. Our findings reveal the true potential of DMAs when accounting for the limitations of both designs.</description>

      <title>Uplink Wave-Domain Combiner for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces Accounting for Hardware Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using refractive metasurfaces (RMTSs) as part of the antenna design offers a promising solution to the ever-increasing demand for improved energy efficiency of wireless communications. To overcome the limitations of using one RMTS layer, a recent proposal is to cascade multiple layers, a structure called stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) where the desired precoder and combiner is formed in the wave domain. However, while proposing the antenna structure, the analysis did not account for the attendant limitations imposed by the hardware used which has a significant impact on the performance of SIMs. In this paper, we study the achievable sum-rate of a SIM antenna in an uplink wireless communication scenario accounting for hardware limitations. We begin by proposing a system model that captures both the effect of noise and hardware limitations in these systems. We then formulate the achievable sum-rate problem; since optimizing the rate is non-convex, we propose two approaches: a gradient ascent algorithm and an interior point method to find a close-to-optimum combiner. To show the efficiency of using SIMs at a basestation, we compare the achievable sum-rate with that of a digital phased array (DPA). We provide two comparisons: first, in Rayleigh fading and realistic 3GPP channels and then under a constraint of an equal number of radio frequency (RF) chains and equal physical aperture size constraint. Our results show that SIM antennas can surpass DPA performance under an equal number of RF chains but has inferior performance under equal aperture size.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Disequilibrium Issues in Tackling Heart Disease Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of heart disease classification, two primary obstacles arise. Firstly, existing Electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets consistently demonstrate imbalances and biases across various modalities. Secondly, these time-series data consist of diverse lead signals, causing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to become overfitting to the one with higher power, hence diminishing the performance of the Deep Learning (DL) process. In addition, when facing an imbalanced dataset, performance from such high-dimensional data may be susceptible to overfitting. Current efforts predominantly focus on enhancing DL models by designing novel architectures, despite these evident challenges, seemingly overlooking the core issues, therefore hindering advancements in heart disease classification. To address these obstacles, our proposed approach introduces two straightforward and direct methods to enhance the classification tasks. To address the high dimensionality issue, we employ a Channel-wise Magnitude Equalizer (CME) on signal-encoded images. This approach reduces redundancy in the feature data range, highlighting changes in the dataset. Simultaneously, to counteract data imbalance, we propose the Inverted Weight Logarithmic Loss (IWL) to alleviate imbalances among the data. When applying IWL loss, the accuracy of state-of-the-art models (SOTA) increases up to 5% in the CPSC2018 dataset. CME in combination with IWL also surpasses the classification results of other baseline models from 5% to 10%.</description>

      <title>A UAV-Enabled Time-Sensitive Data Collection Scheme for Grassland Monitoring Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassland monitoring is essential for the sustainable development of grassland resources. Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate critical ecological data, making data loss unacceptable, but the harsh environment complicates data collection. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) offer efficient data collection solutions, enhancing performance on resource-limited mobile devices. In this context, this paper is the first to investigate a UAV-enabled time-sensitive data collection problem (TSDCMP) within grassland monitoring edge networks (GMENs). Unlike many existing data collection scenarios, this problem has three key challenges. First, the total amount of data collected depends significantly on the data collection duration and arrival time of UAV at each access point (AP). Second, the volume of data at different APs varies among regions due to differences in monitoring objects and vegetation coverage. Third, the service requests time and locations from APs are often not adjacent topologically. To address these issues, We formulate the TSDCMP for UAV-enabled GMENs as a mixed-integer programming model in a single trip. This model considers constraints such as the limited energy of UAV, the coupled routing and time scheduling, and the state of APs and UAV arrival time. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative heuristic algorithm based on temporal-spatial correlations (CHTSC) that integrates a modified dynamic programming (MDP) into an iterated local search to solve the TSDCMP for UAV-enabled GMENs. This approach fully takes into account the temporal and spatial relationships between consecutive service requests from APs. Systematic simulation studies demonstrate that the mixed-integer programming model effectively represents the TSDCMP within UAV-enabled GMENs.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Pre-Trained Transformers for Heart Time-Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoder-only transformers are the backbone of the popular generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) series of large language models. In this work, we apply the same framework to periodic heart time-series data to create two pre-trained general purpose cardiac models, namely PPG-PT and ECG-PT. We demonstrate that both such pre-trained models are fully interpretable. This is achieved firstly through aggregate attention maps which show that the model focuses on similar points in previous cardiac cycles in order to make predictions and gradually broadens its attention in deeper layers. Next, tokens with the same value, that occur at different distinct points in the ECG and PPG cycle, form separate clusters in high dimensional space based on their phase as they propagate through the transformer blocks. Finally, we highlight that individual attention heads respond to specific physiologically relevent features, such as the dicrotic notch in PPG and the P-wave in ECG. It is also demonstrated that these pre-trained models can be easily fine-tuned for tasks such as classification of atrial fibrillation. In this specific example, the fine-tuning took 11 minutes of computer time, and achieved a leave-one-subject-out AUCs of 0.99 and 0.93 for ECG and PPG respectively. Importantly, these fine-tuned models are also fully explainable, with attention shifting to regions in the context that are strongly indicative of atrial fibrillation.</description>

      <title>MambaCapsule: Towards Transparent Cardiac Disease Diagnosis with Electrocardiography Using Mamba Capsule Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardiac arrhythmia, a condition characterized by irregular heartbeats, often serves as an early indication of various heart ailments. With the advent of deep learning, numerous innovative models have been introduced for diagnosing arrhythmias using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, recent studies solely focus on the performance of models, neglecting the interpretation of their results. This leads to a considerable lack of transparency, posing a significant risk in the actual diagnostic process. To solve this problem, this paper introduces MambaCapsule, a deep neural networks for ECG arrhythmias classification, which increases the explainability of the model while enhancing the accuracy.Our model utilizes Mamba for feature extraction and Capsule networks for prediction, providing not only a confidence score but also signal features. Akin to the processing mechanism of human brain, the model learns signal features and their relationship between them by reconstructing ECG signals in the predicted selection. The model evaluation was conducted on MIT-BIH and PTB dataset, following the AAMI standard. MambaCapsule has achieved a total accuracy of 99.54% and 99.59% on the test sets respectively. These results demonstrate the promising performance of under the standard test protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology to enhance spatial multiplexing in wireless networks. This letter considers the discrete passive beamforming design for IRS in order to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among multiple users in an IRS-assisted downlink network. The main design difficulty lies in the discrete phase-shift constraint. Differing from most existing works, this letter advocates a convex-hull relaxation of the discrete constraints which leads to a continuous reformulated problem equivalent to the original discrete problem. This letter further proposes an efficient alternating projection/proximal gradient descent and ascent algorithm for solving the reformulated problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.</description>

      <title>Wideband THz Multi-User Downlink Communications with Leaky Wave Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless systems are envisioned to utilize the large spectra available at THz bands for wireless communications. Extremely massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennas can be costly and power inefficient for wideband THz communications. An alternative antenna technology, which can achieve low cost and power efficient THz signaling, is based on leaky wave antennas (LWAs). In this paper, we explore the usage of the LWAs for wideband downlink multi-user THz communications. We propose a model for LWA-aided communication systems that faithfully captures the antenna operations. We that LWAs yield frequency-dependent beams, where the equivalent wideband channel induces dependence between angle, frequency, and spectral lobe width. We identify the LWAs inherent frequency-selective beamsteering capabilities as motivating multi-band THz communications that deviate from conventional orthogonal frequency-division, and employ non-identical subbands. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm for jointly optimizing the LWA configuration along with the spectral division and power allocation to maximize the achievable sum-rate. Our numerical results show that a single LWA can generate diverse beampatterns, exhibiting performance comparable to costly fully digital MIMO. Interestingly, we demonstrate that allowing transmission with non-identical subbands leverages the characteristics of LWA-based channels compared to uniform division, yielding improved beamsteering that translate to higher rates.</description>

Abstract: The quasi-optical propagation of millimeter-wave signals enables high-accuracy localization algorithms that employ geometric approaches or machine learning models. However, most algorithms require information on the indoor environment, may entail the collection of large training datasets, or bear an infeasible computational burden for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. In this work, we propose to use tiny neural networks (NNs) to learn the relationship between angle difference-of-arrival (ADoA) measurements and locations of a receiver in an indoor environment. To relieve training data collection efforts, we resort to a self-supervised approach by bootstrapping the training of our neural network through location estimates obtained from a state-of-the-art localization algorithm. We evaluate our scheme via mmWave measurements from indoor 60-GHz double-directional channel sounding. We process the measurements to yield dominant multipath components, use the corresponding angles to compute ADoA values, and finally obtain location fixes. Results show that the tiny NN achieves sub-meter errors in 74% of the cases, thus performing as good as or even better than the state-of-the-art algorithm, with significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Ground-to-UAV sub-Terahertz channel measurement and modeling</title>

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted terahertz (THz) wireless communications have been expected to play a vital role in the next generation of wireless networks. UAVs can serve as either repeaters or data collectors within the communication link, thereby potentially augmenting the efficacy of communication systems. Despite their promise, the channel analysis and modeling specific to THz wireless channels leveraging UAVs remain under explored. This work delves into a ground-to-UAV channel at 140 GHz, with a specific focus on the influence of UAV hovering behavior on channel performance. Employing experimental measurements through an unmodulated channel setup and a geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) that integrates three-dimensional positional coordinates and beamwidth, this work evaluates the impact of UAV dynamic movements and antenna orientation on channel performance. Our findings highlight the minimal impact of UAV orientation adjustments on channel performance and underscore the diminishing necessity for precise alignment between UAVs and ground stations as beamwidth increases.</description>

      <title>Observations on Large-Scale Attenuation Effects in a 26 GHz Urban Micro-Cell Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a measurement campaign carried out in an FR2 urban outdoor environment in a live experimental network deployment. The radio propagation analysis from a physical perspective at 26 GHz is essential for the correct deployment and dimensioning of future communication networks. This study performs a walk test emulating realistic conditions under which a pedestrian may be affected, summarizing and evaluating some of the typical effects encountered in a communications scenario such as penetration losses in a building, losses due to vegetation or the human body, or diffraction/scattering propagation around corners in street canyon-like environments. The operational conditions of the 5G network, the urban micro-cell scenario, and the use of omnidirectional antennas on the UE side validate the channel conditions from a perspective closer to a realistic scenario for a pedestrian within a FR2 live network.</description>

      <title>PAPR-optimized OFDM Design for Opportunistic Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems via optimized sparsification of tone reservation (TR). In particular, we propose a novel TR optimization method in which the minimum number of effectively used peak-reserved tones (PRTs) required to satisfy a prescribed PAPR level is found, leaving the remaining PRTs free to be opportunistically utilized by other functionalities, such as joint communication and sensing (JCAS), index modulation (IM), cognitive radio (CR) and others. The proposed method relies on an l0 norm regularization approach to penalize the number of PRTs, leading to a problem convexized via fractional programming (FP), whose solution is shown to ensure that the prescribed PAPR is achieved with high probability with a smaller number of PRTs than state of the art (SotA) methods. The contribution can be seen as a mechanism to enable the opportunistic integration of adjacent functionalities into existing OFDM-based systems.</description>

      <title>IRS-Aided Multi-Antenna Wireless Powered Communications in Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided multi-antenna wireless powered communications in a multi-link interference channel, where multiple IRSs are deployed to enhance the downlink/uplink communications between each pair of hybrid access point (HAP) and wireless device. Our objective is to maximize the system sum throughput by optimizing the allocation of communication resources. To attain this objective and meanwhile balance the performance-cost tradeoff, we propose three transmission schemes: the IRS-aided asynchronous (Asy) scheme, the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided synchronous (Syn) scheme. For the resulting three non-convex design problems, we propose a general algorithmic framework capable of suboptimally addressing all of them. Numerical results show that our proposed IRS-aided schemes noticeably surpass their counterparts without IRSs in both system sum throughput and total transmission energy consumption at the HAPs. Moreover, although the IRS-aided Asy scheme consistently achieves the highest sum throughput, the IRS-aided TDMA scheme is more appealing in scenarios with substantial cross-link interference and limited IRS elements, while the IRS-aided Syn scheme is preferable in low cross-link interference scenarios.</description>

      <title>Image detection using combinatorial auction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal solution of the classical problem of detecting the location of multiple image occurrences in a two-dimensional, noisy measurement. Assuming the image occurrences do not overlap, we formulate this task as a constrained maximum likelihood optimization problem. We show that the maximum likelihood estimator is equivalent to an instance of the winner determination problem from the field of combinatorial auction and that the solution can be obtained by searching over a binary tree. We then design a pruning mechanism that significantly accelerates the runtime of the search. We demonstrate on simulations and electron microscopy data sets that the proposed algorithm provides accurate detection in challenging regimes of high noise levels and densely packed image occurrences.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning for Wireless Networks: A Demonstration with Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.</description>

      <title>Advancing Ultra-Reliable 6G: Transformer and Semantic Localization Empowered Robust Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in 6G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment. Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming. While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations. Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments. This emphasizes a critical need for robust solutions. This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions. An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates. To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem. To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the K-means clustering and YOLOv8 model. To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that combines a lightweight transformer with a CNN architecture through a weighted entropy mechanism. This hybrid architecture utilizes multimodal data sources to dynamically predict the optimal beams. A novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), has been proposed to quantify this. Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Superlattices with Artificial Gauge Field Towards Colorless and Crosstalkless Ultrahigh-Density Photonic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense waveguides are the basic building blocks for photonic integrated circuits (PIC). Due to the rapidly increasing scale of PIC chips, high-density integration of waveguide arrays working with low crosstalk over broadband wavelength range is highly desired. However, the sub-wavelength regime of such structures has not been adequately explored in practice. Herein, we proposed a waveguide superlattice design leveraging the artificial gauge field (AGF) mechanism, corresponding to the quantum analog of field-induced n-photon resonances in semiconductor superlattices. This approach experimentally achieves -24 dB crosstalk suppression with an ultra-broad transmission bandwidth over 500 nm for dual polarizations. The fabricated waveguide superlattices support high-speed signal transmission of 112 Gbit/s with high-fidelity signal-to-noise ratio profiles and bit error rates. This design, featuring a silica upper cladding, is compatible with standard metal back end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes. Based on such a fundamental structure that can be readily transferred to other platforms, passive and active devices over versatile platforms can be realized with a significantly shrunk on-chip footprint, thus it holds great promise for significant reduction of the power consumption and cost in PICs.</description>
