      <title>Broadband Entangled-Photon Pair Generation with Integrated Photonics: Guidelines and A Materials Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated photon-pair sources are key components for quantum computing, networking, and sensing applications. Integrated photonics has enabled chip-scale sources using nonlinear processes, producing high-rate entanglement with sub-100 microwatt power at telecom wavelengths. Many quantum systems operate in the visible or near-infrared ranges, necessitating broadband visible-telecom entangled-pair sources for connecting remote systems via entanglement swapping and teleportation. This study evaluates broadband entanglement generation through spontaneous four-wave mixing in various nonlinear integrated photonic materials, including silicon nitride, lithium niobate, aluminum gallium arsenide, indium gallium phosphide, and gallium nitride. We demonstrate how geometric dispersion engineering facilitates phase-matching for each platform and reveals unexpected results, such as robust designs to fabrication variations and a Type-1 cross-polarized phase-matching condition for III-V materials that expands the operational bandwidth. With experimentally attainable parameters, integrated photonic microresonators with optimized designs can achieve pair generation rates greater than ~1 THz/mW$^2$.</description>

      <title>Birefringence-free photoelastic modulator with centimeter-square aperture operating at 2.7 MHz with sub-watt drive power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoelastic modulators are optical devices with a broad range of applications. These devices typically utilize a transverse interaction mechanism between acoustic and optical waves, resulting in a fundamental trade-off between the input aperture and the modulation frequency. Commercially available modulators with centimeter square apertures have operating frequencies in the vicinity of 50 kHz. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a birefringence-free photoelastic modulator operating at approximately 2.7 MHz with a centimeter square aperture, increasing the operating frequency substantially compared to existing approaches. Using the modulator and polarizers, we demonstrate close to $\pi$ radians polarization modulation amplitude with sub-watt drive power, translating to nearly 100% intensity modulation efficiency at the fundamental (2.7 MHz) and second harmonic (5.4 MHz) frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic mode evolution waveguides (AMEWs) are widely utilized in integrated photonics, including tapered waveguides, edge couplers, mode converters, splitters, etc. An analytical theory and a novel AMEW design algorithm are developed to create shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA). With the new algorithm, we demonstrate a broadband and highly efficient polarization splitter-rotator (PSR) on a lithium-niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform with an LN thickness of 500 nm. The fabricated PSR, with a total length of 2 mm, exhibits an insertion loss (IL) of 0.8 dB and a polarization extinction ratio (ER) of 12 dB over a wavelength range exceeding 76 nm.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in photonic Floquet insulator with unpaired Dirac cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are most frequently constructed using lattices with specific degeneracies in their linear spectra, such as Dirac points. For a broad class of lattices, such as honeycomb ones, these points and associated Dirac cones generally appear in non-equivalent pairs. Simultaneous breakup of the time-reversal and inversion symmetry in systems based on such lattices may result in the formation of the unpaired Dirac cones in bulk spectrum, but the existence of topologically protected edge states in such structures remains an open problem. Here photonic Floquet insulator on honeycomb lattice with unpaired Dirac cones in its spectrum is introduced that can support unidirectional edge states appearing at the edge between two regions with opposite sublattice detuning. Topological properties of this system are characterized by the nonzero valley Chern number. Remarkably, edge states in this system can circumvent sharp corners without inter-valley scattering even though there is no total forbidden gap in the spectrum. Our results reveal unusual interplay between two different physical mechanisms of creation of topological edge states based on simultaneous breakup of different symmetries of the system.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric photonic lattices with type-II Dirac cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The type-II Dirac cone is a special feature of the band structure, whose Fermi level is represented by a pair of crossing lines. It has been demonstrated that such a structure is useful for investigating topological edge solitons, and more specifically, for mimicking the Kline tunneling. However, it is still not clear what the interplay between type-II Dirac cones and the non-Hermiticity mechanism will result in. Here, this question is addressed; in particular, we report the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric photonic lattices with type-II Dirac cones for the first time. We identify a slope-exceptional ring and name it the type-II exceptional ring. We display the restoration of the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the lattice by reducing the separation between the sites in the unit cell. Curiously, the amplitude of the beam during propagation in the non-Hermitian lattice with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry only decays because of diffraction, whereas in the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken lattice it will be amplified, even though the beam still diffracts. This work establishes the link between the non-Hermiticity mechanism and the violation of Lorentz invariance in these physical systems.</description>

      <title>Broadband Light Harvesting from Scalable Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband absorption in the visible spectrum is essential in optoelectronic applications that involve power conversion such as photovoltaics and photocatalysis. Most ultrathin broadband absorbers use parasitic plasmonic structures that maximize absorption using surface plasmons and/or Fabry-Perot cavities, which limits the weight efficiency of the device. Here, we show the theoretical and experimental realization of an unpatterned/planar semiconductor thin-film absorber based on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). We experimentally demonstrate an average total absorption in the visible range (450 nm - 700 nm) of &gt; 70% using &gt; 4 nm of semiconductor absorbing materials scalable over large areas with vapor phase growth techniques. Our analysis suggests that a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.54% and a specific power &gt; 300 W g^-1 may be achieved in a photovoltaic cell based on this metamaterial absorber.</description>

      <title>Optimal input excitations for suppressing nonlinear instabilities in multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping has become a powerful tool for manipulating light propagation in various complex media undergoing linear scattering. Controlling nonlinear optical interactions with spatial degrees of freedom is a relatively recent but growing area of research. A wavefront-shaping-based approach can be used to suppress nonlinear stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and transverse mode instability (TMI), which are the two main limitations to power scaling in high-power narrowband fiber amplifiers. Here we formulate both SBS and TMI suppression as optimization problems with respect to coherent multimode input excitation in a given multimode fiber. We develop an efficient method for finding the globally optimal input excitation for SBS and TMI suppression using linear programming. We theoretically show that optimally exciting a standard multimode fiber leads to roughly an order of magnitude enhancement in output power limited by SBS and TMI, compared to fundamental-mode-only excitation. We find that the optimal mode content is robust to small perturbations and our approach works even in the presence of mode dependent loss and gain. Optimal mode content can be excited in real experiments using spatial light modulators, creating a novel platform for instability-free ultrahigh-power fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Towards the Quantum Limits of Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the spatial phase profile of a single-mode electromagnetic field. Our attention is on input states that are a statistical mixture of displaced and squeezed number states, a superset of Gaussian states. In particular, we derive the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) for estimating the expansion coefficients of the wavefront in an orthonormal basis, finding that it is diagonal. Moreover, we show that a measurement saturating the QFIM always exists, and point to an adaptive strategy capable of implementing it. We then construct the optimal measurements for three particular states: mixtures of photon number, coherent, and single-mode squeezed vacuum states. Sensitivity of the measurements to nuisance parameters is explored.</description>

      <title>Multiple scattering and diffusion of scalar coherent waves in a group of small spheroidal particles with random orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we study multiple scattering and diffusion of scalar wave in a group of monodisperse spheroidal particles with random orientations. We begin by fixing a spheroid in a prolate spheroidal coordinate system, and attain the expansion of the scalar Green's function in this space. The expansion is firstly based on spheroidal wave functions, and then we transform it into the expansion of spherical wave functions. Next, we average the Green's function over the orientations of the spheroid to get the averaged transition operator. Finally, we calculate the transport mean free path and anisotropy factor for the spheroidal particles group, based on the irreducible vertex in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The approaches to get the average transition operator and the mean free paths in this manuscript will be of benefit to the research area of multiple scattering by non-spherical particles.</description>

      <title>Wavefront shaping and imaging through a multimode hollow-core fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode fibers recently emerged as compact minimally-invasive probes for high-resolution deep-tissue imaging. However, the commonly used silica fibers have a relatively low numerical aperture (NA) limiting the spatial resolution of a probe. On top of that, light propagation within the solid core generates auto-fluorescence and Raman background, which interferes with imaging. Here we propose to use a hollow-core fiber to solve these problems. We experimentally demonstrate spatial wavefront shaping at the multimode hollow-core fiber output with tunable high-NA. We demonstrate raster-scan and speckle-based compressive imaging through a multimode hollow-core fiber.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Wave Nonlinear Polarization Control and Signatures of Criticality in a Perovskite Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising photonic materials for fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Their potential for nonlinear optics has also drawn great interest recently; yet, to date, continuous-wave (CW) nonlinearities have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate CW nonlinear phenomena in a CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite cavity. We first demonstrate optical bistability -- the hallmark of single-mode coherent nonlinear optics. Next we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate nonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the optical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a dramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is indicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$ cavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW nonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable. In addition, our approach to uncover a phase transition of matter via optical hysteresis measurements is promising for exploring strongly correlated states of light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Realization of Z$_2$ topological photonic insulators made from multilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have long attracted interest for their intriguing optical and electronic properties. Recently TMDs in their quasi-bulk form have started to show considerable promise for nanophotonics thanks to their high refractive indices, large optical anisotropy, wide transparency windows reaching to the visible, and robust room temperature excitons promising for nonlinear optics. Adherence of TMD layers to any substrate via van der Waals forces is a further key enabler for nanofabrication of sophisticated photonic structures requiring heterointegration. Here, we capitalize on these attractive properties and realize topological spin-Hall photonic lattices made of arrays of triangular nanoholes in 50 to 100 nm thick WS$_2$ flakes exfoliated on SiO$_2$/Si substrates. High quality structures are achieved taking advantage of anisotropic dry etching dictated by the crystal axes of WS$_2$. Reflectance measurements at room temperature show a photonic gap opening in the near-infrared in trivial and topological phases. Unidirectional propagation along the domain interface is demonstrated in real space via circularly polarized laser excitation in samples with both zigzag and armchair domain boundaries. Finite-difference time-domain simulations are used to interpret optical spectroscopy results. Our work opens the way for future sophisticated nanophotonic devices based on the layered (van der Waals) materials platform.</description>

      <title>In vacuum metasurface for optical microtrap array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled and individual controlled particles have revolutionized the atomic, molecular and optical physics, and they afford exquisite capabilities for applications in quantum simulation of many-body physics, quantum computation and quantum sensing. Underlying this development is the technical maturity of generating scalable optical beams, enabled by active components and high numerical aperture objective. However, such a complex combination of bulk optics outside the vacuum chamber is very sensitive to any vibration and drift. Here we demonstrate the generation of 3*3 static tweezer array with a single chip-scale multifunctional metasurface element in vacuum, replacing the meter-long free space optics. Fluorescence counts on the camera validates the successfully trapping of the atomic ensemble array. Further, we discuss the strategy to achieve low scattering and crosstalk, where a metasurface design featuring dual-wavelength independent control is included. Our results, together with other recent development in integrated photonics for cold atoms, could pave the way for compact and portable quantum sensors and simulators in platforms of neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast energy-dispersive soft-x-ray diffraction in the water window with a laser-driven source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved soft-x-ray-diffraction experiments give access to microscopic processes in a broad range of solid-state materials by probing ultrafast dynamics of ordering phenomena. While laboratory-based high-harmonic generation (HHG) light sources provide the required photon energies, their limited photon flux is distributed over a wide spectral range, rendering typical monochromatic diffraction schemes challenging. Here, we present a scheme for energy-dispersive soft-x-ray diffraction with femtosecond temporal resolution and photon energies across the water window from 200 to 600 eV. The experiment utilizes the broadband nature of the HHG emission to efficiently probe large slices in reciprocal space. As a proof-of-concept, we study the laser-induced structural dynamics of a Mo/Si superlattice in an ultrafast, non-resonant soft-x-ray diffraction experiment. We extract the underlying strain dynamics from the measured shift of its first order superlattice Bragg peak in reciprocal space at photon energies around 500 eV via soft-x-ray scattering simulations.</description>

      <title>Time-domain topology optimization of power dissipation in dispersive dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a density-based topology optimization scheme for locally optimizing the electric power dissipation in nanostructures made of lossy dispersive materials. By using the complex-conjugate pole-residue (CCPR) model, we can accurately model any linear materials' dispersion without limiting to specific material classes. We incorporate the CCPR model via auxiliary differential equations (ADE) into Maxwell's equations in the time domain, and formulate a gradient-based topology optimization problem to optimize the dissipation over a broad spectrum of frequencies. To estimate the objective function gradient, we use the adjoint field method, and explain the discretization and integration of the adjoint system into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework. Our method is demonstrated using the example of topology optimized spherical nanoparticles made of Gold and Silicon with an enhanced absorption efficiency in the visible-ultraviolet spectral range. In this context, a detailed analysis of the challenges of topology optimization of plasmonic materials associated with a density-based approach is given.</description>

      <title>Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\eta_{Kerr}=\pm \pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.</description>

      <title>Coherent Acoustic Phonons in Plasmonic Nanoparticles: Elastic Properties and Dissipation at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the frequency and quality factor of mechanical plasmonic nanoresonators as a function of temperature, ranging from ambient to 4 K. Our investigation focused on individual gold nanorods and nanodisks of various sizes. We observed that oscillation frequencies increase linearly as temperature decreases until saturation is reached at cryogenic temperatures. This behavior is explained by the temperature dependence of the elastic modulus, with a Debye temperature compatible with reported bulk values for gold. To describe the behavior of the quality factor, we developed a model considering the nanostructures as anelastic solids, identifying a dissipation peak around 150 K due to a thermally activated process, likely of the Niblett-Wilks mechanism type. Importantly, our findings suggest that external dissipation factors are more critical to improving quality factors than internal friction, which can be increased by modifying the nanoresonator's environment. Our results enable the design of structures with high vibration frequencies and quality factors by effectively controlling external losses.</description>

      <title>16-channel Photonic Solver for Optimization Problems on a Silicon Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we proposed a programmable 16-channel photonic solver for quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. The solver is based on a hybrid optoelectronic scheme including a photonic chip and the corresponding electronic driving circuit. The photonic chip is fabricated on silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate and integrates high-speed electro-optic modulators, thermo-optic phase shifters and photodetectors to conduct the 16-dimensional optical vector-matrix multiplication (OVMM). Due to the parallel and low latency propagation of lightwave, the calculation of the QUBO cost function can be accelerated. Besides, the electronic processor is employed to run the heuristic algorithm to search the optimal solution. In the experiment, two 16-dimensional randomly generated QUBO problems are solved with high successful probabilities. To our knowledge, it is the largest scale of programmable and on-chip photonic solver ever reported. Moreover, the computing speed of the OVMM on photonic chip is ~2 TFLOP/s. It shows the potential of fast solving such optimization problems with integrated photonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the generalised design of low-complexity, small aperture optical terminals intended for kilometre-scale, terrestrial, free-space laser links between fixed and dynamic targets. The design features single-mode fibre coupling of the free-space beam, assisted by a fast-steering, tip/tilt mirror that enables first-order turbulence suppression and fine target tracking. The total power throughput over the free-space link and the scintillation index in fibre are optimised. The optimal tip/tilt correction bandwidth and range, aperture size, and focal length for a given link are derived using analytical atmospheric turbulence modelling and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multiple Interacting Photonic Modes in Strongly Coupled Organic Microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics with molecular materials in optical cavities offers exciting prospects for controlling electronic, nuclear and photonic degrees of freedom for applications in physics, chemistry and materials science. However, achieving strong coupling with molecular ensembles typically requires high molecular densities and substantial electromagnetic field confinement. These conditions usually involve a significant degree of molecular disorder and a highly structured photonic density of states. It remains unclear to what extent these additional complexities modify the usual physical picture of strong coupling developed for atoms and inorganic semiconductors. Using a microscopic quantum description of molecular ensembles in realistic multimode optical resonators, we show that the emergence of a vacuum Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy is a necessary but not sufficient metric of coherent admixing between light and matter. In low finesse multi-mode situations we find that molecular dipoles can be partially hybridised with photonic dissipation channels associated with off-resonant cavity modes. These vacuum-induced dissipative processes ultimately limit the extent of light-matter coherence that the system can sustain.</description>

      <title>Towards ultrasensitive biosensors based on virus-like particles and plasmonic surface lattice resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic surface lattice resonance (SLR) is a phenomenon in which individual localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) excited in periodically-arranged plasmonic nanoparticles couple through the interaction with propagating diffracted incident light. The SLR optical absorption peak is by at least one order of magnitude more intense than the LSPR one, making SLR superior for applications in which LSPR is commonly used. Recently, we have developed a route for the fabrication of spherical virus-like particles (VLPs) with plasmonic cores and protein coronas, where the LSPR in the cores amplifies vibrational signals originating from protein-antibody bonding, showing the potential of VLPs in biodetection. However, the signals were not strong enough to detect antibodies at very low concentrations. Here, we show that by ordering the VLPs in periodic nanoarrays exhibiting SLR amplifies the signals by two orders of magnitude, revealing superior potential of SLR arrays in ultrasensitive biodetection.</description>

      <title>Observation of Space-Dependent Rotational Doppler Shifts with a Single Ion Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experiment investigating the rotational Doppler effect using a single trapped ion excited by two copropagating vortex laser beams. The setup isolates the azimuthal gradients of the fields, eliminating longitudinal and curvature effects. We provide a detailed characterization of the phenomenon by deterministically positioning a single ion across the beams, achieving a signal which depends on the angular velocity of the ion and the difference of optical orbital angular momentum between the two beams. The interpretation of the measurements is supported by numerical simulations and by a simplified analytical model. Our results reveal key properties of the rotational Doppler effect, showing that it increases approaching the center of the beam and that it is independent of the waist of the beam. This offers insights into the feasibility of super-kicks or super-Doppler shifts for sensing and manipulating atomic motion transverse to the beams' propagation direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural vibrational frequencies of biological particles such as viruses and bacteria encode critical information about their mechanical and biological states as they interact with their local environment and undergo structural evolution. However, detecting and tracking these vibrations within a biological context at the single particle level has remained elusive. In this study, we track the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under ambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an 80-100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19-22 GHz range sensitive to virus morphology and 2-10 GHz modes with nanosecond dephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking virus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by the local environment. Single particle tracking allows capture of viral disassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity, high resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into biological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism level.</description>

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D printing) has clear benefits in the production of lightweight mirrors for astronomy: it can create optimised lightweight structures and combine multiple components into one. New capabilities in AM ceramics, silicon carbide infiltrated with silicon and fused silica, offer the possibility to combine the design benefits of AM with a material suitable for visible, ultraviolet and X-ray applications. This paper will introduce the printing methods and post-processing steps to convert AM ceramic samples into reflective mirrors. Surface roughness measurements after abrasive polishing of the AM ceramics will be presented.</description>

Abstract: Due to high dynamic range and ease of use, continuous wave terahertz spectroscopy is an increasingly popular method for optical characterization of components used in cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. In this work, we describe an optical testbed that enables simultaneous measurements of transmission and reflection properties of various radiation absorbing dielectric materials, essential components in the reduction of undesired optical loading. To demonstrate the performance of the testbed, we have measured the reflection response of five absorbers commonly used for such applications: TKRAM, carbon- and iron-loaded Stycast, HR10, AN72, and an in-house 3D printed absorber across a frequency range of 100 to 500 GHz, for both S- and P-polarization, with incident angles varying from 15 to 45 degrees. We present results on both the specular and scattered reflection response of these absorbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that light can break mirror symmetries and combining symmetries with a uniform time translation, and their breaking is characterized by an off-diagonal charge conductivity. Taking periodically driven graphene as an example, we show that mirror symmetries about the $xz$ and $yz$ planes and the combining symmetries, the symmetries of combinations of the mirror operations about these planes and a uniform time translation, can be broken by linearly or circularly polarized light. We also show that this symmetry breaking induces the time-averaged off-diagonal symmetric or antisymmetric charge conductivity in a nonequilibrium steady state with linearly or circularly, respectively, polarized light. Our results are experimentally testable in pump-probe measurements. This work will pave the way for controlling mirror symmetries via light and utilizing the light-induced mirror symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: We have proposed an arbitrary vector beam (VB) generation scheme in a thin disk-shaped quantum dot (QD) medium considering phonon interaction. The QD biexciton system exhibits interplay between first and third-order nonlinear susceptibility between two orthogonal circular polarisation transitions. Three QD transitions are coupled with one applied weak and two strong control orbital angular momentum (OAM) carrying fields. Therefore, the applied field experiences absorption, and a new field with the desired OAM is generated via four-wave mixing (FWM). These two orthogonal field superpositions produce VB at the QD medium end. We have also demonstrated the polarization rotation of a VB by changing only the relative control field phase. Additionally, we have analyzed the effect of temperature on the VB generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonlocal bright solitons subject to external spatially nonuniform potentials. If the potential is slowly varying on the soliton scale, we derive analytical soliton solutions behaving like Newtonian particles. If the potential has the form of an attractive delta-like point defect, we identify different dynamical regimes, defined by the relative strength of the nonlocality and the point defect. In these regimes, the soliton can be trapped at the defect's location, via a nonlinear resonance with a defect mode -- which is found analytically -- reflected by or transmitted through the defect, featuring a wave behavior. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by results of direct numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a leading machine learning algorithm for information processing due to its rich expressiveness. A new RC paradigm has recently emerged, showcasing superior performance and delivering more interpretable results with shorter training data sets and training times, representing the next generation of RC computing. This work presents the first realization of a high-speed next-generation RC system on an integrated photonic chip. Our experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art forecasting and classification performances under various machine learning tasks and achieve the fastest speeds of 60 Gbaud and a computing density of 103 tera operations/second/mm$^2$ (TOPS/mm$^2$). The passive system, composed of a simple star coupler with on-chip delay lines, offers several advantages over traditional RC systems, including no speed limitations, compact footprint, extremely high fabrication error tolerance, fewer metaparameters, and greater interpretability. This work lays the foundation for ultrafast on-chip photonic RC, representing significant progress toward developing next-generation high-speed photonic computing and signal processing.</description>

Abstract: The sequential resonant excitation of a 2-level quantum system results in the emission of a state of light showing time-entanglement encoded in the photon-number-basis - notions that can be extended to 3-level quantum systems as discussed in a recent proposal. Here, we report the experimental implementation of a sequential two-photon resonant excitation process of a solid-state 3-level system, constituted by the biexciton-, exciton-, and ground-state of a semiconductor quantum dot. The resulting light state exhibits entanglement in time and energy, encoded in the photon-number basis, which could be used in quantum information applications, e.g., dense information encoding or quantum communication protocols. Performing energy- and time-resolved correlation experiments in combination with extensive theoretical modelling, we are able to partially retrieve the entanglement structure of the generated state.</description>

Abstract: Silicon vacancy (V$_{Si}$) centers in 4H-silicon carbide have emerged as a strong candidate for quantum networking applications due to their robust electronic and optical properties including a long spin coherence lifetime and bright, stable emission. Here, we report the integration of V$_{Si}$ centers with a plasmonic nanocavity to Purcell enhance the emission, which is critical for scalable quantum networking. Employing a simple fabrication process, we demonstrate plasmonic cavities that support a nanoscale mode volume and exhibit an increase in the spontaneous emission rate with a measured Purcell factor of up to 48. In addition to investigating the optical resonance modes, we demonstrate that an improvement in the optical stability of the spin-preserving resonant optical transitions relative to the radiation-limited value. The results highlight the potential of nanophotonic structures for advancing quantum networking technologies and emphasizes the importance of optimizing emitter-cavity interactions for efficient quantum photonic applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.</description>

      <title>A corner-cube-feedback Faraday laser with 8 kHz linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A single-mode Cs atom 852 nm Faraday laser based on the corner cube feedback is demonstrated, and termed as corner-cube-feedback Faraday laser. Using the corner-cube retroreflector as external cavity feedback element in Faraday laser, mechanical robustness can be greatly improved due to the precise reflection of the incident light beam back to its original direction. This Faraday laser can achieve laser oscillation at a large angle, which between the incident light and the optical axis of corner cube, ranging from +3{\deg} to -3{\deg}. The most probable linewidth is 8 kHz measured by heterodyne beating with two identical lasers. Moreover, its output frequency remains close to the Cs atomic Doppler-broadened transition line, even though the diode current changes from 55 mA to 155 mA and the diode working temperature varies from 11.8 to 37.2 degrees Celsius. The corner-cube-feedback Faraday laser with high mechanical robustness as well as narrow linewidth can be widely used in quantum precision measurement, such as atomic clocks, atomic gravimeters, and atomic magnetometers, etc.</description>

      <title>Ptycho-endoscopy on a lensless ultrathin fiber bundle tip</title>

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) utilizes an aircraft-carried antenna to emit electromagnetic pulses and detect the returning echoes. As the aircraft travels across a designated area, it synthesizes a large virtual aperture to improve image resolution. Inspired by SAR, we introduce synthetic aperture ptycho-endoscopy (SAPE) for micro-endoscopic imaging beyond the diffraction limit. SAPE operates by hand-holding a lensless fiber bundle tip to record coherent diffraction patterns from specimens. The fiber cores at the distal tip modulate the diffracted wavefield within a confined area, emulating the role of the 'airborne antenna' in SAR. The handheld operation introduces positional shifts to the tip, analogous to the aircraft's movement. These shifts facilitate the acquisition of a ptychogram and synthesize a large virtual aperture extending beyond the bundle's physical limit. We mitigate the influences of hand motion and fiber bending through a low-rank spatiotemporal decomposition of the bundle's modulation profile. Our tests demonstrate the ability to resolve a 548-nm linewidth on a resolution target. The achieved space-bandwidth product is ~1.1 million effective pixels, representing a 36-fold increase compared to that of the original fiber bundle. Furthermore, SAPE's refocusing capability enables imaging over an extended depth of field exceeding 2 cm. The aperture synthesizing process in SAPE surpasses the diffraction limit set by the probe's maximum collection angle, opening new opportunities for both fiber-based and distal-chip endoscopy in applications such as medical diagnostics and industrial inspection.</description>

      <title>Onset of Identical Synchronization in the Spatial Evolution of Optical Power in a Waveguide Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated the spatial evolution of optical power in a closed-form optical waveguide configuration consisting of six passive waveguides and each of the waveguides exhibits equal strength of Kerr nonlinearity. We considered only nearest neighbor interaction between the waveguides. We found that in the case of low Kerr nonlinearity, evolution of optical power shows synchronization behavior. But when we increased the strength of Kerr nonlinearity, we discovered that spatial evolution of optical power in all waveguides shows independent characteristics. On the other hand, we have studied the impact of the coupling constant on the synchronization dynamics of our system. Our findings showed us that strong coupling can strengthen the collective dynamics in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. From our results, we can conclude that Kerr nonlinearity in our system plays the role of disorder parameter that destroys as well as alters the synchronization behavior of evolution of optical power in the waveguides and coupling constant plays the role of an antagonist and restores synchronization in the model.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Multi-Head Physics-informed Neural Network for Depth Estimation in Terahertz Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging is one of the hotspots in the field of optics, where the depth information retrieval is a key factor to restore the three-dimensional appearance of objects. Impressive results for depth extraction in visible and infrared wave range have been demonstrated through deep learning (DL). Among them, most DL methods are merely data-driven, lacking relevant physical priors, which thus request for a large amount of experimental data to train the DL models.However, large training data acquirement in the THz domain is challenging due to the requirements of environmental and system stability, as well as the time-consuming data acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, this paper incorporates a complete physical model representing the THz image formation process into traditional DL networks to retrieve the depth information of objects. The most significant advantage is the ability to use it without pre-training, thereby eliminating the need for tens of thousands of labeled data. Through experiments validation, we demonstrate that by providing diffraction patterns of planar objects with their upper and lower halves individually masked, the proposed physics-informed neural network (NN) can automatically optimize and, ultimately, reconstruct the depth of the object through interaction between the NN and a physical model. The obtained results represent the initial steps towards achieving fast holographic THz imaging using reference-free beams and low-cost power detection.</description>

      <title>High-power and narrow-linewidth laser on thin-film lithium niobate enabled by photonic wire bonding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising platform for the realization of high performance chip-scale optical systems, spanning a range of applications from optical communications to microwave photonics. Such applications rely on the integration of multiple components onto a single platform. However, while many of these components have already been demonstrated on the TFLN platform, to date, a major bottleneck of the platform is the existence of a tunable, high-power, and narrow-linewidth on-chip laser. Here, we address this problem using photonic wire bonding to integrate optical amplifiers with a thin-film lithium niobate feedback circuit, and demonstrate an extended cavity diode laser yielding high on-chip power of 78 mW, side mode suppression larger than 60 dB and wide wavelength tunability over 43 nm. The laser frequency stability over short timescales shows an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 550 Hz. Long-term recordings indicate a high passive stability of the photonic wire bonded laser with 58 hours of mode-hop-free operation, with a trend in the frequency drift of only 4.4 MHz/h. This work verifies photonic wire bonding as a viable integration solution for high performance on-chip lasers, opening the path to system level upscaling and Watt-level output powers.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution imaging of nanoscale inhomogeneities in hBN-covered and encapsulated few-layer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encapsulating few-layer graphene (FLG) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can cause nanoscale inhomogeneities in the FLG, including changes in stacking domains and topographic defects. Due to the diffraction limit, characterizing these inhomogeneities is challenging. Recently, the visualization of stacking domains in encapsulated four-layer graphene (4LG) has been demonstrated with phonon polariton (PhP)-assisted near-field imaging. However, the underlying coupling mechanism and ability to image subdiffractional-sized inhomogeneities remain unknown. Here, we retrieve direct replicas and magnified images of subdiffractional-sized inhomogeneities in hBN-covered trilayer graphene (TLG) and encapsulated 4LG, enabled by the hyperlensing effect. This hyperlensing effect is mediated by hBN's hyperbolic PhP that couple to the FLG's plasmon polaritons. Using near-field microscopy, we identify the coupling by determining the polariton dispersion in hBN-covered TLG to be stacking-dependent. Our work demonstrates super-resolution and magnified imaging of inhomogeneities, paving the way for the realization of homogeneous encapsulated FLG transport samples to study correlated physics.</description>

Abstract: Laser interferometry enables to remotely measure microscopical length changes of deployed telecommunication cables originating from earthquakes. Long range and compatibility with data traffic make it unique to the exploration of remote regions, as well as highly-populated areas where optical networks are pervasive, and its large-scale implementation is attractive for both Earth scientists and telecom operators. However, validation and modeling of its response and sensitivity are still at an early stage and suffer from lack of statistically-significant event catalogs and limited availability of co-located seismometers. We implemented laser interferometry on a land-based telecommunication cable and analyzed 1.5 years of continuous acquisition, with successful detections of events in a broad range of magnitudes, including very weak ones. By comparing fiber and seismometer recordings we determined relations between a cable's detection probability and the magnitude and distance of events, and showed that spectral analysis of recorded data allows considerations on the earthquake dynamics. Our results reveal that quantitative analysis is possible for this sensing technique and support the interpretation of data from the growing amount of interferometric deployments. We anticipate the high integration and scalability of laser interferometry into existing telecommunication grids to be useful for the daily seismicity monitoring, in perspective exploitable for civilian protection use.</description>

      <title>Multimode Ultrastrong Coupling in Three-Dimensional Photonic-Crystal Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the role of spatially varying cavity electromagnetic fields in exploring novel cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) phenomena, such as the potential realization of the elusive Dicke superradiant phase transition. One-dimensional photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs), widely used for studying solid-state cQED systems, have uniform spatial profiles in the lateral plane. Three-dimensional (3D) PCCs, which exhibit discrete in-plane translational symmetry, overcome this limitation, but fabrication challenges have hindered the achievement of strong coupling in 3D-PCCs. Here, we report the realization of multimode ultrastrong coupling in a 3D-PCC at terahertz frequencies. The multimode coupling between the 3D-PCC's cavity modes and the cyclotron resonance of a Landau-quantized two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs is significantly influenced by the spatial profiles of the cavity modes, leading to distinct coupling scenarios depending on the probe polarization. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with a multimode extended Hopfield model that accounts for the spatial inhomogeneity of the cavity field. Guided by the model, we discuss the possible strong ground-state correlations between different cavity modes and introduce relevant figures of merit for the multimode ultrastrong coupling regime. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatially nonuniform cavity mode profiles in probing nonintuitive quantum phenomena expected for the ground states of cQED systems in the ultrastrong coupling regime.</description>

Abstract: Dark-field X-ray imaging is a novel modality which visualises scattering from unresolved microstructure. Most dark-field imaging techniques rely on crystals or structured illumination, but recent work has shown that dark-field effects are observable in straightforward propagation-based imaging (PBI). Based on the single-material X-ray Fokker--Planck equation with an a priori dark-field energy dependence, we propose an algorithm to extract phase and dark-field effects from dual-energy PBI images. We successfully apply the dark-field retrieval algorithm to simulated and experimental dual-energy data, and show that by accounting for dark-field effects, projected thickness reconstruction is improved compared to the classic Paganin algorithm. With the emergence of spectral detectors, the method could enable single-exposure dark-field imaging of dynamic and living samples.</description>

Abstract: We found that fluctuations in the number of emitters lead to a super-thermal photon statistics of small LEDs in a linear regime, with a strong emitter-field coupling and a bad cavity favorable for collective effects. A simple analytical expression for the second-order correlation function g_2 is found. g_2 increase up to g_2=6 in the two-level LED model is predicted. The super-thermal photon statistics is related to the population fluctuation increase of the spontaneous emission to the cavity mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective plasmon modes, riding on top of drifting electrons, acquire a fascinating nonreciprocal dispersion characterized by $\omega_p(\bm{q}) \neq \omega_p(-\bm{q})$. The {\it classical} plasmonic Doppler shift arises from the polarization of the Fermi surface due to the applied DC bias voltage. Going beyond this paradigm, we predict a {\it quantum} plasmonic Doppler shift originating from the quantum metric of the Bloch wavefunction. We systematically compare the classical and quantum Doppler shifts by investigating the drift-induced nonreciprocal plasmon dispersion in generic quantum systems. We demonstrate quantum nonreciprocal plasmons in graphene and twisted bilayer graphene. We show that the quantum plasmonic Doppler shift dominates in \moire systems at large wavevectors, yielding plasmonic nonreciprocity up to 20\% in twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings demonstrate the supremacy of plasmonic quantum Doppler shift in \moire systems, motivating the design of innovative nonreciprocal photonic devices with potential technological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect, indicative of the transient light-matter interaction regime between quantum and classical realms, is widely recognized as an essential signature in wide bandgap condensed matter systems such as dielectrics. In this study, we applied the time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy to investigate ultrafast optical responses in graphene, a zero-bandgap system. We observed in the gate-tuned graphene that the massless Dirac materials notably enhance intraband light-driven transitions, significantly leading to the giant dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect compared to the massive Dirac materials, a wide bandgap system. In addition, employing the angle-resolved spectroscopy, it is found that the unique polarimetry orientation, i.e., perpendicular polarizations for the pump and the probe, further pronounces the optical spectra to exhibit the complete fishbone structure, reflecting the quantum pseudospin nature of Dirac cones. Our findings expand the establishment of emergent transient spectroscopy frameworks into not only zero-bandgap systems but also pseudospin-mediated quantum phenomena, moving beyond dielectrics.</description>

      <title>Agile Free-Form Signal Filtering with a Chaotic-Cavity-Backed Non-Local Programmable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filter synthesis is an inverse problem that is traditionally approached rationally by considering spatially disjoint resonators, approximating them as lumped elements, and engineering the coupling of selected pairs. This approach strongly limits the design space, making it challenging to build extremely tunable filters. Here, we demonstrate agile free-form signal filtering with an alternative purely-optimization-based design paradigm using a programmable system with many spatially overlapping modes. We back a programmable metallic metasurface with a quasi-2D chaotic cavity, inducing strong non-local interactions between all meta-elements and the connected ports. Thereby, the metasurface efficiently controls the transfer function between the ports. Our all-metallic device has unique advantages: ultra-wideband (UWB) tunability (7.5-13.5GHz), low loss, compactness, guaranteed linearity under high signal-power levels. First, we experimentally confirm theoretical predictions about reflectionless and transmissionless scattering modes; we also experimentally observe transmissionless exceptional points. Second, we impose diverse types of transfer function zeros at desired frequencies within an UWB range. Third, we achieve low-loss reflectionless programmable signal routing. Fourth, we investigate the trade-off between routing fidelity and bandwidth, achieving 20dB discrimination over 10MHz bandwidth. Fifth, we demonstrate UWB tunable multi-band filters that reject (&lt;-24dB) or pass (&gt;-1dB) signals in specified bands whose centers, widths and number are reprogrammable.</description>
