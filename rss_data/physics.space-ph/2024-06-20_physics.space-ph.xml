      <title>Picturing global substorm dynamics in the magnetotail using low-altitude ELFIN measurements and data mining-based magnetic field reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A global reconfiguration of the magnetotail characterizes substorms. Current sheet thinning, intensification, and magnetic field stretching are defining features of the substorm growth phase and their spatial distributions control the timing and location of substorm onset. Presently, sparse in-situ observations cannot resolve these distributions. A promising approach is to use new substorm magnetic field reconstruction methods based on data mining, termed SST19. Here we compare the SST19 reconstructions to low-altitude ELFIN measurements of energetic particle precipitations to probe the radial profile of the equatorial magnetic field curvature during a 19~August 2022 substorm. ELFIN and SST19 yield a consistent dynamical picture of the magnetotail during the growth phase and capture expected features such as the formation of a thin current sheet and its earthward motion. Furthermore, they resolve a V-like pattern of isotropic electron precipitation boundaries in the time-energy plane, consistent with earlier observations but now over a broad energy range.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Magnetic Cloud from the Merging of Two Successive Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2022 March 28 two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were observed by multiple spacecraft and resulted in a magnetic cloud (MC) at 1 AU. We investigate the propagation and interaction properties of the two CMEs correlated with the MC using coordinated multi-point remote sensing and in situ observations from Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, SOHO, and Wind. The first CME was triggered by a filament eruption with a high inclination angle. Roughly 9 hr later, the second CME originating from the same active region erupted with a smaller tilt angle and faster speed compared to the first one. The second CME overtook the preceding CME and formed a merged front at approximately 75 \rsun{}, which developed into a complex ejecta at 1 AU. The descending speed and low proton temperature inside the complex ejecta suggest that the two CMEs have fully merged before reaching 1 AU, leading them to begin expanding rather than compressing against each other. The complex ejecta appears to have the magnetic field and plasma signatures of an MC, although there is a discontinuity in the magnetic field implying previous interactions. The cross section of the complex ejecta, reconstructed from in situ data using a Grad-Shafranov technique, exhibits a right--handed flux rope structure. These results highlight that an MC--like complex ejecta lacking interaction features could arise from the complete merging of two CMEs.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability Aspects Near the Parker Sonic Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the first ever systematic theoretical formulation to address the long-standing issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This is predicated on the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. For this purpose, a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics is given, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework to accomplish this task. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>Distorted Magnetic Flux Ropes within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic flux ropes within interplanetary coronal mass ejections are often characterized as simplistic cylindrical or toroidal tubes with field lines that twist around the cylinder or torus axis. Recent multi-point observations suggest that the overall geometry of these large-scale structures may be significantly more complex, so that the contemporary modeling approaches would be, in some cases, insufficient to properly understand the global structure of any interplanetary coronal mass ejection. In an attempt to partially rectify this issue, we have developed a novel magnetic flux rope model that allows for the description of arbitrary distortions of the cross-section or deformation of the magnetic axis. The distorted magnetic flux rope model is a fully analytic flux rope model, that can be used to describe significantly more complex geometries and is numerically efficient enough to be used for large ensemble simulations. To demonstrate the usefulness of our model, we focus on a specific implementation of our model and apply it to an ICME event that was observed \textit{in situ} on 2023 April 23 at the L1 point by the Wind spacecraft and also by the STEREO-A spacecraft that was $10.2^\circ$ further east and $0.9^\circ$ south in heliographic coordinates. We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct each observation individual and also gives a fair reconstruction of both events simultaneously using a multi-point reconstruction approach, which results in a geometry that is not fully constistent with a cylindrical or toroidal approximation.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the 2012-July-12 CME Event With the Fluxrope-G3DMHD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their driven shocks are a major source of large geomagnetic storms due to their large and long-lasting, southward component of magnetic field in the sheath and the flux rope (e.g., magnetic cloud). Predicting the strength and arrival time of southward fields accurately thus plays a key role in space weather predictions. To address this problem, we have developed a new model, which combines the global three-dimensional, time-dependent, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), data-driven model (G3DMHD) and a self-contained magnetic flux-rope model [1]. As a demonstration and validation, here we simulate the evolution of a Sun-Earth-directed CME that erupted on 2012-July-12. The computational domain spans from 2.5 solar radii (Rs) from the surface of the Sun, where the flux rope is injected, to 245 Rs. We compare the time profiles of the simulated MHD parameters (Density, velocity, temperature, and magnetic field) with in situ solar wind observations acquired at ~1 AU by the Wind spacecraft and the result is encouraging. The model successfully reproduces the shock, sheath, and flux rope similar to those observed by Wind.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Differences between ICME catalogues and Construction of a Unified Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple magnetic and kinetic solar wind plasma parameters are used to detect coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as they travel through the heliosphere. There are various interplanetary CME (ICME) catalogues, but due to differences between their ICME identification criteria they can significantly vary. In this paper we analyze Richardson and Cane and CCMC CME Scoreboard ICME catalogues and the SRI RAS solar wind types catalogue, and propose an algorithm of merging them. A unified catalogue is constructed for 2010 to 2022. The resulting catalogue is completed with data from the OMNI database. Analysis of the unified catalogue demonstrated high accuracy when merging events present in multiple catalogues and a tendency of events defined in all three initial catalogues to demonstrate greater duration, speed and geoeffectiveness. The catalog is presented on the SINP MSU Space Weather Exchange website: https://swx.sinp.msu.ru/tools/icme_list.php</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional Energetic Electron Fluxes from 150 km to 20,000 km: an ELFIN-Based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong variations of energetic electron fluxes in the Earth's inner magnetosphere are notoriously hard to forecast. Developing accurate empirical models of electron fluxes from low to high altitudes at all latitudes is therefore useful to improve our understanding of flux variations and to assess radiation hazards for spacecraft systems. In the present work, energy- and pitch-angle-resolved precipitating, trapped, and backscattered electron fluxes measured at low altitude by Electron Loss and Fields Investigation (ELFIN) CubeSats are used to infer omnidirectional fluxes at altitudes below and above the spacecraft, from 150 km to 20,000 km, making use of adiabatic transport theory and quasi-linear diffusion theory. The inferred fluxes are fitted as a function of selected parameters using a stepwise multivariate optimization procedure, providing an analytical model of omnidirectional electron flux along each geomagnetic field line, based on measurements from only one spacecraft in low Earth orbit. The modeled electron fluxes are provided as a function of $L$-shell, altitude, energy, and two different indices of past geomagnetic activity, computed over the preceding 4 hours or 3 days, potentially allowing to disentangle impulsive processes (such as rapid injections) from cumulative processes (such as inward radial diffusion and wave-driven energization). The model is validated through comparisons with equatorial measurements from the Van Allen Probes, demonstrating the broad applicability of the present method. The model indicates that both impulsive and time-integrated geomagnetic activity partly control electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt and in the plasma sheet.</description>
