      <title>Minimizing the Profligacy of Searches with Reset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the profligacy of a search process as a competition between its expected cost and the probability of finding the target. The arbiter of the competition is a parameter $\lambda$ that represents how much a searcher invests into increasing the chance of success. Minimizing the profligacy with respect to the search strategy specifies the optimal search. We show that in the case of diffusion with stochastic resetting, the amount of resetting in the optimal strategy has a highly nontrivial dependence on model parameters resulting in classical continuous transitions, discontinuous transitions and tricritical points as well as non-standard discontinuous transitions exhibiting re-entrant behavior and overhangs.</description>

      <title>Complete universal scaling in first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions and critical phenomena are among the most intriguing phenomena in nature and society. They are classified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While the latter show marvelous phenomena of scaling and universality, whether the former behaves similarly is a long-standing controversial issue. Here we definitely demonstrate complete universal scaling in field driven FOPTs for Langevin equations in both zero and two spatial dimensions by rescaling all parameters and subtracting extra contributions with singular dimensions from an effective temperature and a special field according to an effective theory that possesses a fixed point of a seemingly un-physical imaginary value. This offers a perspective different from the usual nucleation and growth but conforming to continuous phase transitions to study FOPTs.</description>

      <title>Non-additive Stochastic Model for Supercooled Liquids: New Perspectives for Glass Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a review of the Non-additive Stochastic Model for supercooled liquids (NSM), an efficient approach for diffusive processes that provides a suitable interpretation for the non-Arrhenius dynamics in these materials. Based on a class of non-homogeneous continuity equations, the NSM provides functions able to model the thermal behavior of the viscosity and diffusivity in fragile liquids. The model defines a rigorous physical criterion that distinguishes super-Arrhenius from sub-Arrhenius processes, establishes a robust scale of fragility, describes fragile-to-strong curves in Angell's plot, and provides an accurate fitting equation for experimental viscosity data as effective as other viscosity classic models.</description>

      <title>Moments of Entropy Production in Dissipative Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the possible moments of entropy production for general overdamped Markovian systems. We find a general formulation of the problem, and derive a new necessary condition between the second and third moment. We determine all possible first, second and third moments of entropy production for a white noise process. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the skewness of the current fluctuations in dissipative devices such as transistors, thereby demonstrating that the Gaussianity assumption widely used in electronic engineering is thermodynamically inconsistent.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain driven by active Rubin bath: transport properties and steady-state correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the properties of an extended system driven by active reservoirs is a question of increasing importance. Here we address this question in two steps. We start by investigating the dynamics of a probe particle connected to an `active Rubin bath' -- a linear chain of overdamped run-and-tumble particles. We derive exact analytical expressions for the effective noise and dissipation kernels, acting on the probe, and show that the active nature of the bath leads to a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation. In the next step, we study the properties of an activity-driven system, modeled by a chain of harmonic oscillators connected to two such active reservoirs at the two ends. We show that the system reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS), remarkably different from that generated due to a thermal gradient. We characterize this NESS by computing the kinetic temperature profile, spatial and temporal velocity correlations of the oscillators, and the average energy current flowing through the system. It turns out that, the activity drive leads to the emergence of two characteristic length scales, proportional to the activities of the reservoirs. Strong signatures of activity are also manifest in the anomalous short-time decay of the velocity autocorrelations. Finally, we find that the energy current shows a non-monotonic dependence on the activity drive and reversal in direction, corroborating previous findings.</description>

      <title>Gelation in input-driven aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate irreversible aggregation processes driven by a source of small mass clusters. In the spatially homogeneous situation, a well-mixed system is consists of clusters of various masses whose concentrations evolve according to an infinite system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We focus on the cluster mass distribution in the long time limit. An input-driven aggregation with rates proportional to the product of merging partners undergoes a percolation transition. We examine this process analytically and numerically. There are two theoretical schemes and two natural ways of numerical integration on the level of a truncated system with a finite number of equations. After the percolation transition, the behavior depends on the adopted approach: The giant component quickly engulfs the entire system (Flory approach), or a non-trivial stationary mass distribution emerges (Stockmayer approach). We also outline generalization to ternary aggregation.</description>

      <title>Exact moments for trapped active particles: inertial impact on steady-state properties and re-entrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behavior of inertial active Brownian particles in a $d$-dimensional harmonic trap in the presence of translational diffusion. While the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is generally challenging, it can be utilized to compute the exact time evolution of all time-dependent dynamical moments using a Laplace transform approach. We present the explicit form for several moments of position and velocity in $d$-dimensions. An interplay of time scales assures that the effective diffusivity and steady-state kinetic temperature depend on both inertia and trap strength, unlike passive systems. We present detailed `phase diagrams' using kurtosis of velocity and position showing possibilities of re-entrance.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic dissipation does not bound replicator growth and decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a well-known paper, Jeremy England derived a bound on the free energy dissipated by a self-replicating system [England, "Statistical physics of self-replication", The Journal of Chemical Physics, 2013]. This bound is usually interpreted as a universal relationship that links thermodynamic dissipation to the replicator's per-capita decay and growth rates. Contrary to this interpretation, we argue from thermodynamic principles that such a relationship cannot exist. In particular, we show that it is impossible for a system to undergo both replication and per-capita decay back into reactants. While it is possible for a system to undergo replication and decay into separate waste products, in that case replication and decay are two independent physical processes, and there is no universal relationship between their thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Hitting probabilities for fast stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical phenomena are modeled as stochastic searchers looking for targets. In these models, the probability that a searcher finds a particular target, its so-called hitting probability, is often of considerable interest. In this work we determine hitting probabilities for stochastic search processes conditioned on being faster than a random short time. Such times have been used to model stochastic resetting or stochastic inactivation. These results apply to any search process, diffusive or otherwise, whose unconditional short-time behavior can be adequately approximated, which we characterize for broad classes of stochastic search. We illustrate these results in several examples and show that the conditional hitting probabilities depend predominantly on the relative geodesic lengths between the initial position of the searcher and the targets. Finally, we apply these results to a canonical evidence accumulation model for decision making.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Response: Equivalence between Thermodynamic Geometry and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result of thermodynamic geometry is that the optimal, minimal-work protocol that drives a nonequilibrium system between two thermodynamic states in the slow-driving limit is given by a geodesic of the friction tensor, a Riemannian metric defined on control space. For overdamped dynamics in arbitrary dimensions, we demonstrate that thermodynamic geometry is equivalent to $L^2$ optimal transport geometry defined on the space of equilibrium distributions corresponding to the control parameters. We show that obtaining optimal protocols past the slow-driving or linear response regime is computationally tractable as the sum of a friction tensor geodesic and a counterdiabatic term related to the Fisher information metric. These geodesic-counterdiabatic optimal protocols are exact for parameteric harmonic potentials, reproduce the surprising non-monotonic behavior recently discovered in linearly-biased double well optimal protocols, and explain the ubiquitous discontinuous jumps observed at the beginning and end times.</description>

Abstract: We show that strong subadditivity provides a simple derivation of the $g$-theorem for the boundary renormalization group flow in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We work out its holographic interpretation and also give a derivation of the $g$-theorem for the case of an interface in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We also geometrically confirm strong subadditivity for holographic duals of conformal field theories on manifolds with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the spiral spin liquid and surrounding phases in the square lattice XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral spin liquids possess a subextensively degenerate ground-state manifold, represented by a continuum of energy minima in reciprocal space. Since a small change of the spiral state wavevector requires a global change of the spin configuration in real space, it is a priori unclear how such systems can fluctuate within the degenerate ground state manifold. Only recently it was proposed that momentum vortices are responsible for the liquidity of the spiral phase and that these systems are closely related to an emergent rank-2 U(1) gauge theory [H. Yan and J. Reuther, Phys. Rev. Research 4, 023175 (2022)]. As a consequence of this gauge structure, four-fold pinch-point singularities were found in a generalized spin correlator. In this article, we use classical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations to embed the previously studied spiral spin liquid into a broader phase diagram of the square lattice XY model. We find a multitude of unusual phases and phase transitions surrounding the spiral spin liquid such as an effective four-state Potts transition into a colinear double-striped phase resulting from the spontaneous breaking of two coupled $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. Since this phase is stabilized by entropic effects selecting the momenta away from the spiral manifold, it undergoes a re-entrance phenomenon at low temperatures into a nematic spiral phase. We also observe a region of parameters where the phase transition into the spiral spin liquid does not break any symmetries and where the critical exponents do not match those of standard universality classes. We study the importance of momentum vortices in driving this phase transition and discuss the possibility of a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of momentum vortices. Finally, we explore the regime where the rank-2 U(1) gauge theory is valid by investigating the four-fold pinch point singularities across the phase diagram</description>

      <title>Flow dichroism of DNA can be quantitatively predicted via coarse-grained molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of multiscale polymer modelling to quantitatively predict DNA linear dichroism (LD) in shear flow. LD is the difference in absorption of light polarised along two perpendicular axes, and has long been applied to study biopolymer structure and drug-biopolymer interactions. As LD is orientation-dependent, the sample must be aligned in order to measure a signal. Shear flow via a Couette cell can generate the required orientation, however it is challenging to separate the LD due to changes in polymer conformation from specific interactions, e.g. drug-biopolymer. In this study, we have applied a combination of Brownian dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict polymer alignment, and hence flow LD, at modest computational cost. As the optical and conformational contributions to the LD can be explicitly separated, our findings allow for enhanced quantitative interpretation of LD spectra through the use of an in-silico model to capture conformational changes. Our model requires no fitting and only five input parameters, the DNA contour length, persistence length, optical factor, solvent quality, and relaxation time, all of which have been well characterized in prior literature. The method is sufficiently general to apply to a wide range of biopolymers beyond DNA, and our findings could help guide the search for new pharmaceutical drug targets via flow LD.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pedestrian Traffic Assignment with Link Transmission Model for Bidirectional Sidewalk Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planning assessment of the urban walking infrastructure requires appropriate methodologies that can capture the time-dependent and unique microscopic characteristics of bidirectional pedestrian flow. In this paper, we develop a simulation-based dynamic pedestrian traffic assignment (DPTA) model specifically formulated for walking networks (e.g. sidewalks) with bidirectional links. The model consists of a dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) based route choice and a link transmission model (LTM) for network loading. The formulated DUE adopts a pedestrian volume delay function (pVDF) taking into account the properties of bidirectional pedestrian streams such as self-organization. The adopted LTM uses a three-dimensional triangular bidirectional fundamental diagram as well as a generalized first-order node model. The applicability and validity of the model is demonstrated in hypothetical small networks as well as a real-world large-scale network of sidewalks in Sydney. The model successfully replicates formation and propagation of shockwaves in walking corridors and networks due to bidirectional effects.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain for graphene and nonrelativistic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic and comparative research on Lorenz ratios for graphene and nonrelativistic systems has been studied to identify their Wiedemann-Franz law violation domain. Fermi energy and temperature are the main governing parameters for deciding the values of the Lorenz ratio, which is basically thermal conductivity divided by electrical conductivity times temperature times Lorenz number. Metals as three-dimensional nonrelativistic electron gas locate at higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain, where Lorenz ratio remains one. Hence, they obey the Wiedemann-Franz law. By creating higher doping in a two-dimensional graphene system, one can again reach a higher Fermi-energy by temperature domain and get a constant Lorenz ratio. For both graphene and non-relativistic systems, the Lorenz ratio goes below one if we go lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain, which is possible for the graphene system by decreasing the doping concentration. Experimentally observed greater than one Lorenz ratio in this lower Fermi-energy by temperature domain or Dirac Fluid domain indicates that non-fluid expressions of Lorenz ratio should be replaced by fluid-type expressions. We have noticed a divergent trend of Lorenz ratio in the Dirac Fluid domain using its fluid-type expression, and it matches with the trend of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dual-Unitary Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator spreading in random dual-unitary circuits within the context of classical shadow tomography. Primarily, we analyze the dynamics of the Pauli weight in one-dimensional qubit systems evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits has a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$, and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits.</description>

      <title>Is $\gamma_{KLS}$-generalized statistical field theory complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter we introduce some field-theoretic approach for computing the critical properties of $\gamma_{KLS}$-generalized systems undergoing continuous phase transitions, namely $\gamma_{KLS}$-statistical field theory. From this new approach emerges the new generalized O($N$)$_{\gamma_{KLS}}$ universality class, which is capable of encompassing nonconventional critical exponents for real imperfect systems known as manganites not described by standard statistical field theory. We compare the generalized results with those obtained from measurements in manganites. The agreement was satisfactory, where the relative errors are $&lt; 5\%$ for the most of manganites used. Although the present approach describes the aforementioned nonconventional critical indices, we show that it is not complete. For example, it does not explain the results for some other manganites, being explained only for nonextensive statistical field theory recently introduced in literature. So, $\gamma_{KLS}$-statistical field theory has to be discarded for statistical mechanics generalization purposes.</description>

      <title>Weak-coupling limits of the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Langevin equation as obtained from the independent-oscillator model describes a strong-coupling situation, devoid of the Born-Markov approximation that is employed in the context of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equation. The question we address is what happens when we implement such `Born-Markov'-like approximations at the level of the quantum Langevin equation for a harmonic oscillator which carries a noise term satisfying a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In this backdrop, we also comment on the rotating-wave approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an exact matrix product steady state and matrix product forms of local observables for the bulk impurity-doped XXZ spin model coupled to dissipators at both ends, whose dynamics is described by the Lindblad quantum master equation. We find that local magnetization is induced at the impurity site when the spin current flows, which is contrary to the usual situation where current suppresses magnetization due to heating. It is proved that this current-induced magnetization survives in the thermodynamic limit, and the spin current does not depend on the impurity strength. We discuss the role of bulk integrability by comparing the results with those of non-integrable models solved numerically by the quantum trajectory method.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable subspaces of non-integrable spin chains with boundaries and quasiparticle interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two new strategies to construct a family of non-integrable spin chains with exactly solvable subspace based on the idea of quasiparticle excitations from the matrix product vacuum state. The first one allows the boundary generalization, while the second one makes it possible to construct the solvable subspace with interacting quasiparticles. Each generalization is realized by removing the assumption made in the conventional method, which is the frustration-free condition or the local orthogonality, respectively. We found that the structure of embedded equally-spaced energy spectrum is not violated by the diagonal boundaries, as log as quasiparticles are non-interacting in the invariant subspace. On the other hand, we show that there exists a one-parameter family of non-integrable Hamiltonians which show perfectly embedded energy spectrum of the integrable spin chain. Surprisingly, the embedded energy spectrum does change by varying the free parameter of the Hamiltonian. The constructed eigenstates in the solvable subspace are the candidates of quantum many-body scar states, as they show up in the middle of the energy spectrum and have entanglement entropies expected to obey the sub-volume law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show by extensive simulations that the whole supercritical phase of the three-dimensional uniform forest model simultaneously exhibits an infinite tree and a rich variety of critical phenomena. Besides typical scalings like algebraically decaying correlation, power-law distribution of cluster sizes, and divergent correlation length, a number of anomalous behaviors emerge. The fractal dimensions for off-giant trees take different values when being measured by linear system size or gyration radius. The giant-tree size displays two-length scaling fluctuations, instead of following the central-limit theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of Floquet circuits that can interpolate between non-interacting qubits, free propagation, generic interacting, and dual-unitary dynamics. We identify the operator entanglement entropy of the two-qubit gate as a good quantitative measure of the interaction strength. We test the persistence of localization in the vicinity of the non-interacting point by probing spectral statistics, decay of autocorrelators, and measuring entanglement growth. The finite-size analysis suggests that the many-body localized regime does not persist in the thermodynamic limit. Instead, our results are compatible with an integrability-breaking phenomenon.</description>

      <title>When correlations exceed system size: finite-size scaling in free boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11721v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We progress finite-size scaling in systems with free boundary conditions above their upper critical dimension, where in the thermodynamic limit critical scaling is described by mean-field theory. Recent works show that the correlation length is not bound by the system's physical size, a belief that long held sway. Instead, two scaling regimes can be observed - at the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. We demonstrate that both are manifest for free boundaries. We use numerical simulations of the $d=5$ Ising model to analyse the magnetization, susceptibility, magnetization Fourier modes and the partition function zeros. While some of the response functions hide the dual finite-size scaling, the precision enabled by the analysis of Lee-Yang zeros allows this be brought to the fore. In particular, finite-size scaling of leading zeros at the pseudo-critical point confirms recent predictions coming from correlations exceeding the system size. This paper is dedicated to Jaroslav Ilnytskyi on the occasion of his 60th birthday.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are fundamental results in nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. Among these, the paradigmatic Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem relates the statistics of the works done in a forward out-of-equilibrium quantum process and in a corresponding backward one. In particular, the initial states of the two processes are thermal states and thus incoherent in the energy basis. Here, we aim to investigate the role of initial quantum coherence in work fluctuation theorems. To do this, we formulate and examine the implications of a stronger fluctuation theorem, which reproduces the Tasaki-Crooks fluctuation theorem in the absence of initial quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Long-Ranged Influence of an Inclusion in Momentum-Conserving Active Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that an inclusion placed inside a dilute Stokesian suspension of microswimmers induces power-law number-density modulations and flows. These take a different form depending on whether the inclusion is held fixed by an external force, for example an optical tweezer, or if it is free. When the inclusion is held in place, the far-field fluid flow is a Stokeslet, while the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^{2+\epsilon}$, with $r$ the distance from the inclusion, and $\epsilon$ an anomalous exponent which depends on the symmetry of the inclusion and varies continuously as a function of a dimensionless number characterizing the relative amplitudes of the convective and diffusive effects. The angular dependence takes a non-trivial form which depends on the same dimensionless number. When the inclusion is free to move, the far-field fluid flow is a stresslet and the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^2$ with a simple angular dependence. These long-range modulations mediate long-range interactions between inclusions that we characterize.</description>

      <title>Classical action for the height within the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we write down a classical (not quantum) action for the surface height for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth. We do so starting with the regular Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) action (which is quantum - contains the constraint field) and integrate out the quantum constraint field exactly. We analyze the classical action, we thereby obtain, within the gaussian and one loop approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces. The gaussian analysis predicts instabilities to rough surfaces below two dimensions while one loop predicts stronger surface stability to roughness and instabilities to roughness below one dimension rather than two dimensions. The one loop analysis shows that the KPZ action is incomplete and that we generate additional terms (not found in the initial action) in the action perturbatively. In the supplement we also modify the KPZ equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilt on the noise (that is have multiplicatively coupled noise).</description>

Abstract: The double Pareto distribution is a heavy-tailed distribution with a power-law tail, that is generated via geometric Brownian motion with an exponentially distributed observation time. In this study, we examine a modified model wherein the exponential distribution of the observation time is replaced with a continuous uniform distribution. The probability density, complementary cumulative distribution, and moments of this model are exactly calculated. Furthermore, the validity of the analytical calculations is discussed in comparison with numerical simulations of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Exact Thermal Eigenstates of Nonintegrable Spin Chains at Infinite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically, for the first time, thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We consider a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most strict sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

Abstract: We study a notion of operator growth known as Krylov complexity in free and interacting massive scalar quantum field theories in $d$-dimensions at finite temperature. We consider the effects of mass, one-loop self-energy due to perturbative interactions, and finite ultraviolet cutoffs in continuous momentum space. These deformations change the behavior of Lanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity and induce effects such as the "staggering" of the former into two families, a decrease in the exponential growth rate of the latter, and transitions in their asymptotic behavior. We also discuss the relation between the existence of a mass gap and the property of staggering, and the relation between our ultraviolet cutoffs in continuous theories and lattice theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying entanglement is an important task by which the resourcefulness of a quantum state can be measured. Here we develop a quantum algorithm that tests for and quantifies the separability of a general bipartite state, by making use of the quantum steering effect, the latter originally discovered by Schr\"odinger. Our separability test consists of a distributed quantum computation involving two parties: a computationally limited client, who prepares a purification of the state of interest, and a computationally unbounded server, who tries to steer the reduced systems to a probabilistic ensemble of pure product states. To design a practical algorithm, we replace the role of the server by a combination of parameterized unitary circuits and classical optimization techniques to perform the necessary computation. The result is a variational quantum steering algorithm (VQSA), which is a modified separability test that is better suited for the capabilities of quantum computers available today. We then simulate our VQSA on noisy quantum simulators and find favorable convergence properties on the examples tested. We also develop semidefinite programs, executable on classical computers, that benchmark the results obtained from our VQSA. Our findings here thus provide a meaningful connection between steering, entanglement, quantum algorithms, and quantum computational complexity theory. They also demonstrate the value of a parameterized mid-circuit measurement in a VQSA and represent a first-of-its-kind application for a distributed VQA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.18182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of Parisi where a single particle hops on an infinite-dimensional hypercube, under the influence of a uniform but disordered magnetic flux. We reinterpret the hypercube as the Fock-space graph of a many-body Hamiltonian and the flux as a frustration of the return amplitudes in Fock space. We will identify the set of observables that have the same correlation functions as the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DS-SYK) model, and hence the hypercube model is an equally good quantum model for near-AdS$_2$/near-CFT$_{1}$ (NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$) holography. Unlike the SYK model, the hypercube Hamiltonian is not $p$ local. Instead, the SYK model can be understood as a Fock-space model with similar frustrations. Hence we propose this type of Fock-space frustration as the broader characterization for NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$ microscopics, which encompasses the hypercube and the DS-SYK models as two specific examples. We then speculate on the possible origin of such frustrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating quarks and hadronic systems, produced in peripheral heavy ion collisions, can experience Coriolis force and other forces due to rotational motion. Considering only the effect of Coriolis force, we have calculated the electrical conductivity for non-relativistic rotating matter using the Relaxation Time Approximation based Boltzmann transport equation. A similarity in mathematical calculations of electrical conductivity at finite rotation and finite magnetic fields is exposed, where an equivalence role between Coriolis force on massive particle's motion and Lorentz force on charged particle's motion is noticed. As the beginning level step, we consider only the Coriolis force in the non-relativistic formalism, which will be extended in the future towards the relativistic case, and to adopt other forces for a more realistic description of the rotating quark and hadronic system.</description>

      <title>Entropic sampling in frustrated magnets: role of self-intersecting spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets typically possess a large space of classical ground states. If this degeneracy is not protected by symmetry, thermal fluctuations may `select' certain states via order-by-disorder. In this article, we examine a precursor effect where all ground states are sampled, but with different weights. Geometry plays a key role in determining the weight distribution and its behaviour. We demonstrate this with two examples -- both clusters with four spins coupled by XY interactions. In the first, the classical ground states form a smooth space. In the second, they form a self-intersecting non-manifold space. Ground state sampling is very different in these two cases. We first consider the microcanonical ensemble picture, where fluctuations conserve energy. Phase space arguments suggest that the first model exhibits energy-independent probabilities. The second shows a dramatic energy-dependence with relative probability increasing as $\epsilon^{-1/2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the energy of the system. We simulate low-energy dynamics in both models, confirming the expected behaviour. We next consider the canonical ensemble, where the first model produces temperature-independent probabilities. In the second, relative probability rises sharply as $T^{-1/2}$, where $T$ is the temperature. Our results bring out a classical analogue of order-by-singularity, a mechanism that has been recently proposed in the context of quantum spin clusters. The sampling of classical orders is qualitatively different in systems with self-intersecting ground state spaces. It grows at low energies and becomes singular as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ (microcanonical ensemble) or $T\rightarrow 0$ (canonical ensemble). We discuss relevance for disordered phases in macroscopic magnets, particularly for spiral liquids.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple proof of a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of non-equilibrium steady states of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We demonstrate the applications of the sufficient condition using examples of the transverse-field Ising model, the XYZ model, and the tight-binding model with dephasing.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of transition-state theory for complex quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of quantum complex systems through a potential barrier is often described with transition-state theory, also known as RRKM theory in chemistry. Here we derive the basic formula for transition-state theory based on a generic Hamiltonian as might be constructed in a configuration-interaction basis. Two reservoirs of random Hamiltonians from Gaussian orthogonal ensembles are coupled to intermediate states representing the transition states at a barrier. Under the condition that the decay of the reservoirs to open channels is large, an analytic formula for reaction rates is derived. The transition states act as independent Breit-Wigner resonances which contribute additively to the total transition probability, as is well known for electronic conductance through resonant tunneling states. It is also found that the transition probability is independent of the decay properties of the states in the second reservoir over a wide range of decay widths.</description>

      <title>Exact asymptotics of long-range quantum correlations in a nonequilibrium steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium states of many-body systems tend to evade a description by standard statistical mechanics, and their uniqueness is epitomized by the possibility of certain long-range correlations that cannot occur in equilibrium. In quantum many-body systems, coherent correlations of this sort may lead to the emergence of remarkable entanglement structures. In this work, we analytically study the asymptotic scaling of quantum correlation measures -- the mutual information and the fermionic negativity -- within the zero-temperature steady state of voltage-biased free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice containing a noninteracting impurity. Previously, we have shown that two subsystems on opposite sides of the impurity exhibit volume-law entanglement, which is independent of the absolute distances of the subsystems from the impurity. Here we go beyond that result and derive the exact form of the subleading logarithmic corrections to the extensive terms of correlation measures, in excellent agreement with numerical calculations. In particular, the logarithmic term of the mutual information asymptotics can be encapsulated in a concise formula, depending only on simple four-point ratios of subsystem length-scales and on the impurity scattering probabilities at the Fermi energies. This echoes the case of equilibrium states, where such logarithmic terms may convey universal information about the physical system. To compute these exact results, we devise a hybrid method that relies on Toeplitz determinant asymptotics for correlation matrices in both real space and momentum space, successfully circumventing the inhomogeneity of the system. This method can potentially find wider use for analytical calculations of entanglement measures in similar scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate superradiant enhancements in the refrigeration performance of a set of $N$ three-level systems that are collectively coupled to a hot and a cold thermal reservoir and are additionally subject to collective periodic (circular) driving. Assuming the system-reservoir coupling to be weak, we explore the regime of stronger periodic driving strengths by comparing collective weak driving, Floquet-Lindblad, and Floquet-Redfield master equations. We identify regimes where the power injected by the periodic driving is used to pump heat from the cold to the hot reservoir and derive analytic sufficient conditions for them based on a cycle analysis of the Floquet-Lindblad master equation. In those regimes, we also argue for which parameters collective enhancements like a quadratic scaling of the cooling current with $N$ can be expected and support our arguments by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian Inference for Molecular Simulations using Local Gaussian Process Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Bayesian inference is the gold standard for uncertainty quantification and propagation, its use within physical chemistry encounters formidable computational barriers. These bottlenecks are magnified for modeling data with many independent variables, such as X-ray/neutron scattering patterns and electromagnetic spectra. To address this challenge, we apply a Bayesian framework accelerated via local Gaussian process (LGP) surrogate models. We show that the time-complexity of LGPs scales linearly in the number of independent variables, in stark contrast to the computationally expensive cubic scaling of conventional Gaussian processes. To illustrate the method, we trained a LGP surrogate model on the experimental radial distribution function of liquid neon, and observed a remarkable 288,000-fold speed-up compared to molecular dynamics with insignificant loss in predictive accuracy. We conclude that LGPs are robust and efficient surrogate models, poised to expand the application of Bayesian inference in molecular simulations to a broad spectrum of ever-advancing experimental data.</description>

      <title>Universal symmetry of optimal control at the microscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the energy efficiency of driving processes provides valuable insights into the underlying physics and is of crucial importance for numerous applications, from biological processes to the design of machines and robots. Knowledge of optimal driving protocols is particularly valuable at the microscale, where energy supply is often limited. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically the paradigmatic optimization problem of moving a potential carrying a load through a fluid, in a finite time and over a given distance, in such a way that the required work is minimal. An important step towards more realistic systems is the consideration of memory effects in the surrounding fluid, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Therefore, our experiments were performed in viscous and viscoelastic media, which are typical environments for synthetic and biological processes on the microscale. Despite marked differences between the protocols in both fluids, we find that the optimal control protocol and the corresponding average particle trajectory always obey a time-reversal symmetry. We show that this symmetry, which surprisingly applies here to a class of processes far from thermal equilibrium, holds universally for various systems, including active, granular, and long-range correlated media in their linear regimes. The uncovered symmetry provides a rigorous and versatile criterion for optimal control that greatly facilitates the search for energy-efficient transport strategies in a wide range of systems. Using a machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate that the algorithmic exploitation of time-reversal symmetry can significantly enhance the performance of numerical optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Critical temperature and thermodynamic properties of a homogeneous dilute weakly interacting Bose gas within the improved Hartree-Fock approximation at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By means of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action approach we investigate a homogeneous dilute weakly interacting Bose gas at finite temperature in vicinity of critical region. A longstanding debate, the shift of critical temperature, is considered and obtained in the universal form $\Delta T_C/T_C^{(0)} = cn_0^{1/3}a_s$ with constants $c$ and $a$. The non-condensate fraction is contributed by quantum fluctuations as well as thermal exitations and can be expressed in sum of three terms. These terms correspond to the quantum fluctuations, thermal fluctuations and both. Indeed, the specific heat capacity and critical exponents are calculated and in excellent agreement with those in previous works and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Fisher information rates in sequentially measured quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact that temporal correlations in the measurement statistics can have on the achievable precision in a sequential metrological protocol. In this setting, and for a single quantum probe, we establish that it is the transitions between the measurement basis states that plays the most significant role in determining the precision, with the resulting conditional Fisher information being interpretable as a rate of information acquisition. Projective measurements are shown to elegantly demonstrate this in two disparate estimation settings. Firstly, in determining the temperature of an environment and, secondly, to ascertain a parameter of the system Hamiltonian. In both settings we show that the sequential estimation approach can provide a useful method to enhance the achievable precision.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>
