      <title>From In Silico to In Vitro: A Comprehensive Guide to Validating Bioinformatics Findings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of bioinformatics predictions and experimental validation plays a pivotal role in advancing biological research, from understanding molecular mechanisms to developing therapeutic strategies. Bioinformatics tools and methods offer powerful means for predicting gene functions, protein interactions, and regulatory networks, but these predictions must be validated through experimental approaches to ensure their biological relevance. This review explores the various methods and technologies used for experimental validation, including gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction verification, and pathway validation. We also discuss the challenges involved in translating computational predictions to experimental settings and highlight the importance of collaboration between bioinformatics and experimental research. Finally, emerging technologies, such as CRISPR gene editing, next-generation sequencing, and artificial intelligence, are shaping the future of bioinformatics validation and driving more accurate and efficient biological discoveries.</description>

      <title>Omni-DNA: A Unified Genomic Foundation Model for Cross-Modal and Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable generalizability across diverse tasks, yet genomic foundation models (GFMs) still require separate finetuning for each downstream application, creating significant overhead as model sizes grow. Moreover, existing GFMs are constrained by rigid output formats, limiting their applicability to various genomic tasks. In this work, we revisit the transformer-based auto-regressive models and introduce Omni-DNA, a family of cross-modal multi-task models ranging from 20 million to 1 billion parameters. Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications. All the models are available through https://huggingface.co/collections/zehui127</description>

      <title>Controllable Sequence Editing for Counterfactual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence models generate counterfactuals by modifying parts of a sequence based on a given condition, enabling reasoning about "what if" scenarios. While these models excel at conditional generation, they lack fine-grained control over when and where edits occur. Existing approaches either focus on univariate sequences or assume that interventions affect the entire sequence globally. However, many applications require precise, localized modifications, where interventions take effect only after a specified time and impact only a subset of co-occurring variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for counterfactual reasoning about both immediate and delayed effects. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when interventions should influence a sequence. With these concepts, CLEF selectively edits relevant time steps while preserving unaffected portions of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on cellular and patient trajectory datasets, where gene regulation affects only certain genes at specific time steps, or medical interventions alter only a subset of lab measurements. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing by up to 36.01% in MAE compared to baselines. Unlike prior methods, CLEF enables one-step generation of counterfactual sequences at any future time step, outperforming baselines by up to 65.71% in MAE. A case study on patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus shows that CLEF identifies clinical interventions that shift patient trajectories toward healthier outcomes.</description>
