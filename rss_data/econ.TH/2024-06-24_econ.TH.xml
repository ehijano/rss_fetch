      <title>Network-Based Optimal Control of Pollution Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a model for the optimal control (by a centralized economic agent which we call the planner) of pollution diffusion over time and space. The controls are the investments in production and depollution and the goal is to maximize an intertemporal utility function. The main novelty is the fact that the spatial component has a network structure. Moreover, in such a time-space setting we also analyze the trade-off between the use of green or non-green technologies: this also seems to be a novelty in such a setting. Extending methods of previous papers, we can solve explicitly the problem in the case of linear costs of pollution.</description>

      <title>Maximum Flow is Fair: A Network Flow Approach to Committee Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the committee voting setting, a subset of $k$ alternatives is selected based on the preferences of voters. In this paper, our goal is to efficiently compute ex-ante fair probability distributions (or lotteries) over committees. Since it is not known whether a lottery satisfying the desirable fairness property of fractional core is polynomial-time computable, we introduce a new axiom called group resource proportionality (GRP), which strengthens other fairness notions in the literature. We characterize our fairness axiom by a correspondence with max flows on a network formulation of committee voting. Using the connection to flow networks revealed by this characterization, we then introduce voting rules which achieve fairness in conjunction with other desirable properties. The redistributive utilitarian rule satisfies ex-ante efficiency in addition to our fairness axiom. We also give a voting rule which maximizes social welfare subject to fairness by reducing to a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem. Lastly, we show our fairness property can be obtained in tandem with strong ex-post fairness properties -- an approach known as best-of-both-worlds fairness. We strengthen existing best-or-both-worlds fairness results in committee voting and resolve an open question posed by Aziz et al. (2023). These findings follow from an auxiliary result which may prove useful in obtaining best-of-both-worlds type results in future research on committee voting.</description>

      <title>Computing Optimal Manipulations in Cryptographic Self-Selection Proof-of-Stake Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptographic Self-Selection is a paradigm employed by modern Proof-of-Stake consensus protocols to select a block-proposing "leader." Algorand [Chen and Micali, 2019] proposes a canonical protocol, and Ferreira et al. [2022] establish bounds $f(\alpha,\beta)$ on the maximum fraction of rounds a strategic player can lead as a function of their stake $\alpha$ and a network connectivity parameter $\beta$. While both their lower and upper bounds are non-trivial, there is a substantial gap between them (for example, they establish $f(10\%,1) \in [10.08\%, 21.12\%]$), leaving open the question of how significant of a concern these manipulations are. We develop computational methods to provably nail $f(\alpha,\beta)$ for any desired $(\alpha,\beta)$ up to arbitrary precision, and implement our method on a wide range of parameters (for example, we confirm $f(10\%,1) \in [10.08\%, 10.15\%]$).
  Methodologically, estimating $f(\alpha,\beta)$ can be phrased as estimating to high precision the value of a Markov Decision Process whose states are countably-long lists of real numbers. Our methodological contributions involve (a) reformulating the question instead as computing to high precision the expected value of a distribution that is a fixed-point of a non-linear sampling operator, and (b) provably bounding the error induced by various truncations and sampling estimations of this distribution (which appears intractable to solve in closed form). One technical challenge, for example, is that natural sampling-based estimates of the mean of our target distribution are \emph{not} unbiased estimators, and therefore our methods necessarily go beyond claiming sufficiently-many samples to be close to the mean.</description>
