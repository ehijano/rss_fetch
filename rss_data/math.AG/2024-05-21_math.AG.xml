      <description>arXiv:2405.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Miura equivalence of two integrable systems associated to a semi-simple cohomological field theory: the double ramification hierarchy of Buryak and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy. This equivalence was conjectured by Buryak and further refined by Buryak, Dubrovin, Gu\'er\'e, and Rossi.</description>

As an example, we use the library FFTW to compute fast Fourier transforms inside Macaulay2.</description>

      <title>Invariance of elliptic genus under wall-crossing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-crossing formulas for various flavors of elliptic genus can be obtained using master spaces. We give a topological criterion which implies that such wall-crossing formulas are trivial. Applications are given for: GIT quotients, following Thaddeus; moduli of sheaves, following Mochizuki; Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten theory, following Joyce and Tanaka-Thomas respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of smoothing algebraic cycles with rational coefficients on smooth projective complex varieties up to homological equivalence. We show that a solution to this problem would be incompatible with the validity of the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections in projective space. We also solve unconditionally a symplectic variant of this problem.</description>

      <title>Dieudonn\'e theory via cohomology classifying stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove two results: first, we use crystalline cohomology of classifying stacks to directly reconstruct the classical Dieudonn\'e module of a finite, $p$-power rank, commutative group scheme $G$ over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. As a consequence, we give a new proof of the isomorphism $\sigma^* M(G) \simeq \mathrm{Ext}^1 (G, \mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{crys}})$ due to Berthelot--Breen--Messing using stacky methods combined with the theory of de Rham--Witt complexes. Additionally, we show that finite locally free commutative group schemes of $p$-power rank over a quasisyntomic base ring embed fully faithfully into the category of prismatic $F$-gauges, which extends the work of Ansch\"utz and Le Bras on prismatic Dieudonn\'e theory.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentzian polynomials are a fascinating class of real polynomials with many applications. Their definition is specific to the nonnegative orthant. Following recent work, we examine Lorentzian polynomials on proper convex cones. For a self-dual cone $\mathcal{K}$ we find a connection between $\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian polynomials and $\mathcal{K}$-positive linear maps, which were studied in the context of the generalized Perron-Frobenius theorem. We find that as the cone $\mathcal{K}$ varies, even the set of quadratic $\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian polynomials can be difficult to understand algorithmically. We also show that, just as in the case of the nonnegative orthant, $\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian and $\mathcal{K}$-completely log-concave polynomials coincide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the analytic structure of the double and triple point spaces $M_2(f)$ and $M_3(f)$ of finite multi-germs $f\colon (X,S)\to(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$, based on results of Mond and Pellikaan for the mono-germ case. We show that these spaces are Cohen-Macaulay, provided that certain dimensional conditions are satisfied, and give explicit expressions for their defining ideals in terms of those of their mono-germ branches.</description>

      <title>Exploring Ground and Excited States via Single Reference Coupled-Cluster Theory and Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the root structure of coupled cluster equations holds both foundational and practical significance for computational quantum chemistry. This study provides insight into the intricate root structures of these non-linear equations at both the CCD and CCSD level of theory. We utilize computational techniques from algebraic geometry, specifically the monodromy and parametric homotopy continuation methods, to calculate the full solution set. We compare the computed CC roots against various established theoretical upper bounds, shedding light on the accuracy and efficiency of these bounds. We hereby focus on the dissociation processes of four-electron systems such as (H$_2$)$_2$ in both D$_{2{\rm h}}$ and D$_{\infty {\rm h}}$ configurations, H$_4$ symmetrically distorted on a circle, and lithium hydride. We moreover investigate the ability of single-reference coupled cluster solutions to approximate excited state energies. We find that multiple CC roots describe energies of excited states with high accuracy. Remarkably, our investigations reveal that for systems like lithium hydride, CC not only provides high-accuracy approximations to several excited state energies but also to the states themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Shimura varieties admit integral canonical models for sufficiently large primes. In the case of abelian-type Shimura varieties, this recovers work of Kisin-Kottwitz for sufficiently large primes. We also prove the existence of integral canonical models for images of period maps corresponding to geometric families. We deduce several consequences from this, including an unramified rigid analogue of Borel's extension theorem, a version of Tate semisimplicity, CM lifting theorems, and a weakened version of Tate's isogeny theorem for ordinary points.</description>

      <title>Hybrid dynamics of hyperbolic automorphisms of K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study degenerating families of hyperbolic dynamics over complex K3 surfaces by means of the theory of hybrid spaces by Boucksom, Favre, and Jonsson. For an analytic family of hyperbolic automorphisms $\{f_t: X_t\to X_t\}_{t\in\mathbb{D}^*}$ over K3 surfaces $X_t$ that is possibly meromorphically degenerating at the origin, we consider the family of invariant measures $\{\eta_t\}$ on $X_t$ constructed by Cantat. The family $f_t$ induces a hyperbolic automorphism $f_{\mathbb{C}((t))}^{\mathop{\mathrm{an}}}:X_{\mathbb{C}((t))}^{\mathop{\mathrm{an}}}\to X_{\mathbb{C}((t))}^{\mathop{\mathrm{an}}}$ over the induced non-archimedean K3 surface, where we also have a measure $\eta_0$ by Filip. Our main theorem states the weak convergence of $\{\eta_t\}$ to $\eta_0$ as $t\to0$ over the induced so-called hybrid space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of holomorphic maps from a compact Riemann surface to a projective space blown up at finitely many points. We show that the homology of this mapping space equals that of the space of continuous maps that intersect the exceptional divisors positively, once the degree of the maps is sufficiently positive compared to the degree of homology. The proof uses a version of Vassiliev's method of simplicial resolution. As a consequence, we obtain a homological stability result for rational curves on the degree $5$ del Pezzo surface, which is analogous to a case of the Batyrev--Manin conjectures on rational point counts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.08411v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a new stratification of the space of configurations of $n$ marked points on the complex plane. Recall that this space can be differently interpreted as the space $^{\rm D}{\rm Pol}_{n}$ of degree $n&gt;1$ complex, monic polynomials with distinct roots, the sum of which is 0. A stratum $A_{\sigma}$ is the set of polynomials having $P^{-1}(\mathbb{R}\cup\imath\mathbb{R})$ in the same isotopy class, relative to their asymptotic directions. We show that this stratification is a Goresky--MacPherson stratification and that from thickening strata a good cover in the sense of \v{C}ech can be constructed, allowing an explicit computation of the cohomology groups of this space.</description>

      <title>Almost coherent modules and almost coherent sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10773v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the theory of almost coherent modules that was introduced in "Almost Ring Theory" by Gabber and Ramero. Then we globalize it by developing a new theory of almost coherent sheaves on schemes and on a class of "nice" formal schemes. We show that these sheaves satisfy many properties similar to usual coherent sheaves, i.e. the Almost Proper Mapping Theorem, the Formal GAGA, etc. We also construct an almost version of the Grothendieck twisted image functor $f^!$ and verify its properties. Lastly, we study sheaves of $p$-adic nearby cycles on admissible formal models of rigid spaces and show that these sheaves provide examples of almost coherent sheaves. This gives a new proof of the finiteness result for \'etale cohomology of proper rigid spaces obtained before in the work of Peter Scholze "$p$-adic Hodge Theory For Rigid-Analytic Varieties".</description>

      <title>On the Covers of Orbifold Curves Preserving the Slope Stability under Pullback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely characterize the covers of connected orbifold curves which preserve slope stability of vector bundles under the pullback morphism. More precisely, given a cover $f \colon (Y,Q) \longrightarrow (X,P)$ of connected orbifold curves, we show that the maximal destabilizing sub-bundle of the pushforward sheaf $f_*\mathcal{O}_{(Y,Q)}$ defines the maximal \'{e}tale sub-cover of $f$. The cover $f$ is said to be genuinely ramified if $f$ does not factor through any non-trivial \'{e}tale sub-cover. Our main result states that the class of covers $f$ that preserves the stable bundles under a pullback are precisely the class of genuinely ramified covers $f$. Further, we establish equivalent conditions for the cover $f$ to be genuinely ramified, generalizing earlier works on covers of curves. We thoroughly study the slope stability conditions of bundles on an orbifold curve, their properties under the pushforward and pullback maps under covers with a stand point of Deligne-Mumford stacks, hence giving a solid foundation of the subject. As a consequence, we also answer the question of descent of stable bundles under genuinely ramified covers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any smooth complex projective surface $S$, we construct semistable refined Vafa-Witten invariants of $S$ which prove the main conjecture of arXiv:1810.00078. This is done by extending part of Joyce's universal wall-crossing formalism to equivariant K-theory, and to moduli stacks with symmetric obstruction theories, particularly moduli stacks of sheaves on Calabi-Yau threefolds. An important technical tool which we introduce is the symmetrized pullback, along smooth morphisms, of symmetric obstruction theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce homological and homotopical $r$-syzygies of Mori fibre spaces as a generalization of Sarkisov links and relations of Sarkisov links. For any proper morphism $Y/R$, we construct a contractible (if not empty) CW complex such that there is a 1-1 correspondence between its cells and the central models of $Y/R$. We derive from this CW complex a long exact sequence and a spectral sequence converging to the (co)homology of the relative birational automorphism group of $Y/R$. As an application, we compute the second group homology of the second Cremona group.</description>

      <title>On diminished multiplier ideal and the termination of flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a theory of diminished multiplier ideal on singular varieties which notion was introduced by Lehmann, and we prove a result regarding the termination of certain class of flips with scaling of an ample divisor with bounded index if $\kappa_{\sigma}(K_X+\Delta)\ge \dim X-1$ holds using the theory of diminished multiplier ideal.</description>

      <title>Quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local invariants of a meromorphic quadratic differential on a compact Riemann surface are the orders of zeros and poles, and the residues at the poles of even orders. The main result of this paper is that with few exceptions, every pattern of local invariants can be obtained by a quadratic differential on some Riemann surface. The exceptions are completely classified and only occur in genera zero and one. Moreover, in the case of a nonconnected stratum, we show that, with three exceptions in genus one, every invariants can be realized in each connected component of the stratum. These results are obtained using the flat metric induced by the differentials. We give an application by bounding the number of disjoint cylinders on a primitive quadratic differential.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa theory of fine Selmer groups associated to Drinfeld modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power and $F=\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ be the rational function field over $\mathbb{F}_q$, the field with $q$ elements. Let $\phi$ be a Drinfeld module over $F$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ be a non-zero prime ideal of $A:=\mathbb{F}_q[T]$. Over the constant $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$, we introduce the fine Selmer group associated to the $\mathfrak{p}$-primary torsion of $\phi$. We show that it is a cofinitely generated module over $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$. This proves an analogue of Iwasawa's $\mu=0$ conjecture in this setting, and provides context for the further study of the objects that have been introduced in this article.</description>
