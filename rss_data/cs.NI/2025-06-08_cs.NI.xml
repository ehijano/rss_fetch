      <title>Pegasus: A Universal Framework for Scalable Deep Learning Inference on the Dataplane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed. However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations, including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality: Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides" high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy. Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to 22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear symbols combining for Power Amplifier-distorted OFDM signal reception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear distortion of a multicarrier signal by a transmitter Power Amplifier (PA) can be a serious problem when designing new highly energy-efficient wireless systems. Although the performance of standard reception algorithms is seriously deteriorated by the nonlinear distortion, the more advanced solutions allow the utilization of additional frequency diversity caused by nonlinear PA. However, while most of the advanced receivers are decision-aided, their gains are observed mostly in a relatively low Bit Error Rate (BER) region, not targeted by adaptive Modulation Coding Schemes utilizing Forward Error Correction (FEC). In this paper, a non-decision-aided Higher-Order Combining (HOC) reception scheme is proposed. While the analytical formulas for finding symbols combining coefficients are not known, machine learning is used for deriving them. The simulation results show an improved BER performance with respect to a standard reception and one of the established decision-aided receivers. However, as HOC has computational complexity that increases rapidly with the number of subcarriers utilized, more studies are needed to apply it in a wideband system.</description>

      <title>On the Suitability of Wi-Fi for Interconnecting Moving Equipment in Industrial Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To ensure an unprecedented degree of flexibility, next-generation Industry 4.0/5.0 production plants increasingly rely on mobile devices, e.g., autonomous mobile robots and wearables. In these cases, a major requirement is getting rid of cables through the adoption of wireless networks. To this purpose, Wi-Fi is currently deemed one of the most promising solutions. Achieving reliable communications over the air for distributed real-time control applications is, however, not devoid of troubles. In fact, bounded transmission latency must be ensured for most of the exchanged packets. Moreover, for devices powered on batteries, energy consumption also needs to be taken into account. In this paper, a joint simulated analysis of these aspects is carried out to quantitatively evaluate what we can practically expect from Wi-Fi technology.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation with Asynchronous Reception for User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The user-centric, cell-free wireless network is a promising next-generation communication system, but signal synchronization issues arise due to distributed access points and lack of cellular structure. We propose a novel method to recover synchronous pilot reception by introducing new pilot sequences and a matched filter window, enabling orthogonality even with asynchronous reception. Our approach mimics synchronous transmission by extending training sequences. Analysis shows asynchronous reception's impact on channel estimation, and our method significantly improves performance with a small increase of training time overhead. Results demonstrate a 7.26 dB reduction in normalized mean square error and 40% increase in data rate, achieving performance levels comparable to the synchronous case.</description>

      <title>Network Hexagons Under Attack: Secure Crowdsourcing of Geo-Referenced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical requirement for modern-day Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the ability to collect geo-referenced data from connected vehicles and mobile devices in a safe, secure and anonymous way. The Nexagon protocol, which builds on the IETF Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) and the Hierarchical Hexagonal Clustering (H3) geo-spatial indexing system, offers a promising framework for dynamic, privacy-preserving data aggregation. Seeking to address the critical security and privacy vulnerabilities that persist in its current specification, we apply the STRIDE and LINDDUN threat modelling frameworks and prove among other that the Nexagon protocol is susceptible to user re-identification, session linkage, and sparse-region attacks. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced security architecture that combines public key infrastructure (PKI) with ephemeral pseudonym certificates. Our solution guarantees user and device anonymity through randomized key rotation and adaptive geospatial resolution, thereby effectively mitigating re-identification and surveillance risks in sparse environments. A prototype implementation over a microservice-based overlay network validates the approach and underscores its readiness for real-world deployment. Our results show that it is possible to achieve the required level of security without increasing latency by more than 25% or reducing the throughput by more than 7%.</description>

      <title>Contracts: A unified lens on congestion control robustness, fairness, congestion, and generality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Congestion control algorithms (CCAs) operate in partially observable environments, lacking direct visibility into link capacities, or competing flows. To ensure fair sharing of network resources, CCAs communicate their fair share through observable signals. For instance, Reno's fair share is encoded as $\propto 1/\sqrt{\texttt{loss rate}}$. We call such communication mechanisms \emph{contracts}. We show that the design choice of contracts fixes key steady-state performance metrics, including robustness to errors in congestion signals, fairness, amount of congestion (e.g., delay, loss), and generality (e.g., range of supported link rates). This results in fundamental tradeoffs between these metrics. Using properties of contracts we also identify design pitfalls that lead to starvation (extreme unfairness). We argue that CCA design and analysis should start with contracts to conscientiously pick tradeoffs and avoid pitfalls. We empirically validate our findings and discuss their implications on CCA design and network measurement.</description>

      <title>Direct-to-Cell: A First Look into Starlink's Direct Satellite-to-Device Radio Access Network through Crowdsourced Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations have recently emerged as a viable access solution for broadband services in underserved areas. In 2024, Direct Satellite-to-Device (DS2D) communications, which enable unmodified smartphones to connect directly to spaceborne base stations, entered large-scale beta testing, with Starlink globally leading deployments. This paper presents the first measurement study of commercial DS2D services. Using crowdsourced mobile network data collected in the U.S. between October 2024 and April 2025, our research derives evidence-based insights into the capabilities, limitations, and prospective evolution of DS2D technologies providing Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) services to expand existing mobile network connectivity. We observe a strong correlation between the number of satellites deployed and the expanding extension of observed measurements, concentrated in accessible but poorly covered areas by terrestrial networks, such as national parks and large low-density counties. The data reveal stable physical-layer value measurement throughout the observation period, with a lower median RSRP (24-dB difference) and a higher RSRQ (3 dB difference) compared to terrestrial networks, reflecting the SMS-only usage of the DS2D network during this period. Based on SINR measurements, we estimate the expected performance of the announced DS2D mobile data service to be around 4 Mbps per beam in outdoor conditions. We also discuss strategies to expand this capacity up to 24 Mbps in the future, depending on key regulatory decisions regarding satellite licenses, spectrum availability, and allowable radiated power levels.</description>
