      <title>Cosmic-Ray Feedback from Supernovae in a Stratified Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each supernova's energy drives interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence and can help launch galactic winds. What difference does it make if $10\%$ of the energy is initially deposited into cosmic rays? To answer this question and study cosmic-ray feedback, we perform galactic patch simulations of a stratified ISM. We compare two magnetohydrodynamic and cosmic ray (MHD+CR) simulations, which are identical except for how each supernova's energy is injected. In one, $10\%$ of the energy is injected as cosmic-ray energy and the rest is thermal. In the other case, energy injection is strictly thermal. We find that cosmic-ray injections (1) drive a faster vertical motion with more mass, (2) produce a more vertically oriented magnetic field, and (3) increase the scale height of warm gas outside the midplane $(z \gtrsim 0.5\,\mathrm{kpc})$. Both simulations show the formation of cold clouds (with a total mass fraction $&gt;50\%$) through the Parker instability and thermal instability. We also show that the Parker instability leads to a decorrelation of cosmic-ray pressure and gas density. Finally, our simulations show that a vertical magnetic field can lead to a significant decrease in the calorimetric fraction for injected cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the Milky Way disk is rapidly improving with the recent advent of the high quality and vast amount of observational data. We summarize our current view of the structure of the Milky Way disk, such as the masses and sizes of the gas and stellar disks, and the position and motion of the Sun in the disk. We also discuss the different definitions of the thick and thin disks of the Milky Way, the non-axisymmetric structures of the stellar disk, such as the bar and spiral arms, and the radial migration which can be triggered by these non-axisymmetric stellar structures. After the revolutionary data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, our view of the Milky Way disk has been transformed to a non-equilibrium system with many complicated structures in stellar kinematic distribution. We also summarize the recent findings of Galactoseismology research. These detailed observational data provide the archaeological information for us to unveil the formation and evolution history of the Milky Way disk, with the aid of the high-resolution numerical simulations of the Milky Way-like galaxy formation. We also discuss the current view of the formation history of the Milky Way disk.</description>

      <title>A unique window into the Epoch of Reionisation: A double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter in the proximity zone of a quasar at $z\sim 6.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of a double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ emitter, named LAE-11, found in the proximity zone of QSO J0910-0414 at $z\sim6.6$. We use a combination of deep photometric data from Subaru Telescope, HST, and JWST with spectroscopic data from Keck/DEIMOS, NIRCam WFSS and NIRSpec MSA to characterise the ionising and general properties of the galaxy, as well as the quasar environment surrounding it. We detect Ly$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII] doublet, and H$\alpha$ emission lines in the various spectral datasets. The presence of a double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ line in the spectrum allows us to characterise the opening angle and lifetime of the QSO as $\theta_Q&gt;49.62${\deg} and $t_Q &gt; 3.8\times10^5$ years. LAE-11 is a fairly bright (M$_\rm{UV} = -19.84^{+0.14}_{-0.16}$), blue galaxy with a UV slope of $\beta = -2.61^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$. Since the galaxy is located in a quasar-ionised region, we have a unique opportunity to measure the escape fraction of Lyman Continuum photons using the un-attenuated double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ emission profile and its equivalent width at such high redshift. We employ diagnostics which do not rely on the detection of Ly$\alpha$ for comparison, and find that all tracers of ionising photon leakage agree within 1$\sigma$ uncertainty. We measure a moderate escape of Lyman Continuum photons from LAE-11 of $f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC} = (8 - 33)\%$. Detections of both H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines allow for separate measurements of the ionising photon production efficiency, resulting with $\log(\xi_\rm{ion}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 25.59\pm0.08$ and $25.65\pm0.09$, for H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, respectively. The total ionising output of LAE-11, $\log(f_\rm{esc}^\rm{LyC}\xi_\rm{ion, H\alpha}/\rm{Hz~erg^{-1}}) = 24.85^{+0.24}_{-0.34}$, is higher than the value of $24.3 - 24.8$ which is traditionally assumed as needed to drive Reionisation forward.</description>

      <title>The CIViL* Survey: The Discovery of a C IV Dichotomy in the CGM of L* Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates C IV absorption in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of L* galaxies and its relationship with galaxy star formation rates. We present new observations from the C IV in L* survey (CIViL*; PID$\#$17076) using the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. By combining these measurements with archival C IV data (46 observations total), we estimate detection fractions for star-forming (sSFR $&gt;$ 10$^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$) and passive galaxies (sSFR $\leq$ 10$^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$) to be 72$_{-18}^{+14}$\% [21/29] and 23$_{-15}^{+27}$\% [3/13], respectively. This indicates a significant dichotomy in C IV presence between L* star-forming and passive galaxies, with over 99% confidence. This finding aligns with Tumlinson et al. (2011), which noted a similar dichotomy in O VI absorption. Our results imply a substantial carbon reservoir in the CGM of L* galaxies, suggesting a minimum carbon mass of $\gtrsim$ 3.03 $\times$ 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ out to 120 kpc. Together, these findings highlight a strong connection between star formation in galaxies and the state of their CGM, providing insight into the mechanisms governing galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The Age-Thickness Relation of the Milky Way Disk: A Tracer of Galactic Merging History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing model of galaxy formation proposes that galaxies like the Milky Way are built through a series of mergers with smaller galaxies over time. However, the exact details of the Milky Way's assembly history remain uncertain. In this study, we show that the Milky Way's merger history is uniquely encoded in the vertical thickness of its stellar disk. By leveraging age estimates from the value-added LAMOST DR8 catalog and the StarHorse ages from SDSS-IV DR12 data, we investigate the relationship between disk thickness and stellar ages in the Milky Way using a sample comprising Red Giants (RG), Red Clump Giants (RCG), and metal-poor stars (MPS). Guided by the IllustrisTNG50 simulations, we show that an increase in the dispersion of the vertical displacement of stars in the disk traces its merger history. This analysis reveals the epoch of a major merger event that assembled the Milky Way approximately 11.13 billion years ago, as indicated by the abrupt increase in disk thickness among stars of that age, likely corresponding to the Gaia-Sausage Enceladus (GSE) event. The data do not exclude an earlier major merger, which may have occurred about 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the geometric thick disk of the Milky Way was formed around 11.13 billion years ago, followed by a transition period of approximately 2.6 billion years leading to the formation of the geometric thin disk, illustrating the galaxy's structural evolution. Additionally, we identified three more recent events -- 5.20 billion, 2.02 billion, and 0.22 billion years ago -- potentially linked to multiple passages of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Our study not only elucidates the complex mass assembly history of the Milky Way and highlights its past interactions but also introduces a refined method for examining the merger histories of external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Testing Colour-magnitude Pattern as A Method in the Search for Changing-Look AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple method to search for changing-look (CL) active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates, and conduct a test run. In this method, optical variations of AGNs are monitored and CL-AGNs may appear to have a pattern of being bluer when in brightening flare-like events. Applying this method, previously-classified type 2 AGNs that show the bluer-when-brighter (BWB) pattern are selected. Among more than ten thousands type 2 AGNs classified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find 73 candidates with possibly the strongest BWB pattern. We note that 13 of them have previously been reported as CL-AGNs. We have observed nine candidates, and found that five among them showed the CL transition from type 2 to type 1. In addition, we also test extending the selection to previously-classified type 1 AGNs in the SDSS by finding sources with a possible redder-when-brighter pattern, but none of the three sources observed by us is found to show the transition from type 1 to type 2. We discuss the variation properties in both the success and failure cases, and plan to observe more candidates selected with the method. From the observational results, a detailed comparison between the CL-AGNs and none CL-AGNs will help quantitatively refine the selection criteria and in turn allow us to configure the general properties of CLAGNs.</description>

      <title>Study of Satellite Plane Structure Characteristics Based on TNG50 Simulations: A Comparative Analysis from Plane to Non-Plane Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, multiple plane structures of satellite galaxies have been identified in the nearby universe, although their formation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we employ the TNG50-1 numerical simulation to classify satellite systems into plane and non-plane structures, based on their geometric and dynamical properties. We focus on comparing the characteristics of these plane and non-plane structures. The plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit a mean height of 5.24 kpc, with most of them found in galaxy groups with intermediate halo virial masses within the narrow range of $10^{11.5}$ to $10^{12.5}$ $M_\odot$. Statistical analyses reveal that plane structures of satellite galaxies constitute approximately 11.30% in TNG50-1, with this proportion increasing to 27.11% in TNG100-1, aligning closely with previous observations. Additionally, central galaxies in clusters and groups hosting co-rotating plane structures are intermediate massive and slightly metal-poorer than those in non-plane structures. Significant difference are found between in-plane and out-of-plane satellite galaxies, suggesting that in-plane satellites exhibit slightly longer formation times, and more active interstellar matter cycles. The satellites within these plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit similar radial distributions with observations, but are fainter and more massive than those in observational plane structures, due to the over- or under-estimation of galaxy properties in simulations. Our analysis also shows that the satellite plane structures might be effected by some low- or high-mass galaxies temporarily entered the plane structures due to the gravitational potential of the clusters and groups after the plane structures had formed.</description>

      <title>A statistical approach for interpreting polarized dust emission of the filamentary molecular clouds toward the estimate of 3D magnetic field structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we perform 3D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of filamentary molecular clouds. We then generate synthetic observations based on the simulation results. Using these, we investigate how the new polarization data analysis method recently introduced by \citet{2021ApJ...923L...9D} reflects the magnetic field structure in turbulent filamentary molecular clouds. \citet{2021ApJ...923L...9D} proposed that the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$, the ratio of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the polarized intensity ($PI$) to that of the total intensity ($I$) can be used to probe the three-dimensional structure of the magnetic field. We calculate the $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ from the density and magnetic field structure obtained in the 3D-MHD simulations. We find that the mean and variance of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ within a filament are smaller and larger, respectively, with a larger inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky. We also find that both small-scale ($&lt;0.1~\rm{pc}$) and large-scale ($\gtrsim 0.1~\rm{pc}$) turbulence affect the polarized intensity of the dust thermal emission. We conclude that future extensive observations of $R_{\rm{FWHM}}$ may be able to quantify the inclination of the magnetic field to the plane-of-sky in the filamentary molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ATOMS survey: Vibrationally excited HC$_3$N lines in hot cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar molecules are excellent tools for studying the physical and chemical environments of massive star-forming regions. In particular, vibrationally excited HC$_3$N (HC$_3$N*) lines are the key tracers for probing hot cores environments. We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 3 mm observations of HC$_3$N* lines in 60 hot cores, aiming to investigate how physical conditions affect the excitation of HC$_3$N* transitions. We have used the XCLASS for line identification. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), we derived the rotation temperature and column density of HC$_3$N* transitions in hot cores. Additionally, we calculated the H$_2$ column density and number density, along with the abundance of HC$_3$N* relative to H$_2$, to enable a comparison of the physical properties of hot cores with different numbers of HC$_3$N* states. We have detected HC$_3$N* lines in 52 hot cores, in which 29 cores showing more than one vibrationally excited state. Hot cores with higher gas temperatures have more detections of these vibrationally excited lines. The excitation of HC$_3$N* requires dense environments, with its spatial distribution influenced by the presence of UC Hii regions. The observed column density of HC$_3$N* contributes to the number of HC$_3$N* states in hot core environments. After analyzing the various factors influencing HC$_3$N* excitation in hot cores, we conclude that the excitation of HC$_3$N* is mainly driven by mid-IR pumping, while collisional excitation is ineffective.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasars discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>

      <title>A binary system in the S cluster close to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity stars and peculiar G objects orbit the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Together, the G objects and high-velocity stars constitute the S cluster. In contrast with theoretical predictions, no binary system near Sgr A* has been identified. Here, we report the detection of a spectroscopic binary system in the S cluster with the masses of the components of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.50 M$_{\odot}$ and 0.73 $\pm$ 0.14 M$_{\odot}$, assuming an edge-on configuration. Based on periodic changes in the radial velocity, we find an orbital period of 372 $\pm$ 3 days for the two components. The binary system is stable against the disruption by Sgr A* due to the semi-major axis of the secondary being 1.59 $\pm$ 0.01 AU, which is well below its tidal disruption radius of approximately 42.4 AU. The system, known as D9, shows similarities to the G objects. We estimate an age for D9 of 2.7$^{+1.9}_{-0.3}$ x 10$^6$ yr that is comparable to the timescale of the SMBH-induced von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycle period of about 10$^6$ yr, causing the system to merge in the near future. Consequently, the population of G objects may consist of pre-merger binaries and post-merger products. The detection of D9 implies that binary systems in the S cluster have the potential to reside in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole Sgr A* for approximately 10$^6$ years.</description>

      <title>The interdependence between density PDF, CMF and IMF and their relation with Mach number in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of stars and the corresponding cloud mass function (CMF), traditionally considered universal, exhibit variations that are influenced by the local environment. Notably, these variations are apparent in the distribution's tail, indicating a possible relationship between local dynamics and mass distribution. Our study is designed to examine how the gas PDF , the IMF and the CMF depend on the local turbulence within the interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations on small star-forming sections of the ISM under varying turbulence conditions, characterized by Mach numbers of 1, 3.5, and 10, and with two distinct mean densities. This approach allowed us to observe the effects of different turbulence levels on the formation of stellar and cloud masses. The study demonstrates a clear correlation between the dynamics of the cloud and the IMF. In environments with lower levels of turbulence likely dominated by gravitational collapse, our simulations showed the formation of more massive structures with a powerlaw gas PDF, leading to a top-heavy IMF and CMF. On the other hand environment dominated by turbulence result in a lognormal PDF and a Salpeter-like CMF and IMF. This indicates that the turbulence level is a critical factor in determining the mass distribution within star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Insight into the Starburst Nature of Galaxy GN-z11 with JWST MIRI Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) covering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008 and H$\alpha$ emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The line profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic FWHMs of 189$\pm$25 and 231$\pm$52 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. We do not find any evidence of a dominant broad H$\alpha$ emission line component tracing a Broad Line Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad ($\sim$430-470 kms$^{-1}$) and weak ($&lt;$ 20-30%) H$\alpha$ line component, tracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely with the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation properties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst forming stars at a rate of SFR(H$\alpha$)$=$24 $\pm$3$M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The electron temperature of the ionized gas is $T_{\mathrm{e}}$(O$^{++}$)$=$14000$\pm$2100K, while the direct-$T_{\mathrm{e}}$ gas-phase metallicity is 12+$\log$(O/H)$=$7.91$\pm$0.07 (Z=0.17$\pm$0.03Z$_{\odot}$). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the starburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity starbursts and high-$z$ luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to GN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with that of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its high SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest stellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free, highly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate this scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the existence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Disk North-south Asymmetry in Metallicity May Be A New Tracer for the Disk Warp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic disk warp has been widely characterized by stellar distributions and stellar kinematics but has not been traced by stellar chemistry. Here, we use a sample with over 170,000 red clump (RC) stars selected from LAMOST and APOGEE first to establish a correlation between the north-south asymmetry in metallicity ([Fe/H]) and the disk warp. Our results indicate that the height of the [Fe/H] mid-plane for the whole RC sample stars is accurately described as $Z_{w}$ = 0.017 ($R$ $-$ 7.112)$^{2}$ sin($\phi$ $-$ 9.218). This morphology aligns closely with the warp traced by Cepheids, suggesting that the disk north-south asymmetry in [Fe/H] may serve as a new tracer for the Galactic warp. Our detailed analysis of the young/thin disk stars of this RC sample suggests that its warp is well-modeled as $Z_{w}$ = 0.016 ($R$ $-$ 6.507)$^{2}$ sin($\phi$ $-$ 4.240), indicating that the line of node (LON) of the Galactic warp is oriented at 4.240$_{-1.747}^{+1.641}$ degree.</description>

      <title>Update on Dusty Sources and Candidate Young Stellar Objects in the S-cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center provides a unique opportunity to observe a galactic core, objects in close proximity to a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and star formation channels that exhibit imprints of this peculiar environment. This habitat hosts, in addition to the SMBH Sgr A*, a surprisingly young cluster with the so-called S-stars. These stars orbit the SMBH on timescales of a few years with thousands of km/s. While the presence of high-velocity stars in the S-cluster already raises a variety of scientific questions, the observation of several bright L-band emission sources has resulted in a rich discussion of their nature. The detection of a prominent Doppler-shifted Br$\gamma$ line accompanies most of these sources that seem to be embedded in a dusty envelope. Using the radiative-transfer model HYPERION, we find strong indications of the presence of a stellar low-mass population embedded in the S-cluster. We revisit this intriguing cluster and its dusty members that orbit the supermassive black hole Sgr A* on bound Keplerian trajectories. Among these cluster members, there is one source that initiated the studies of this analysis: G1. We find that the flux density of G1 in the NIR and MIR resembles a spectral energy distribution of a Class I YSO, which contributes to the "Paradox of Youth".</description>

      <title>HCG 57: Evidence for shock-heated intergalactic gas from X-rays and optical emission line spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the compact group HCG 57, and optical integral field spectroscopy of the interacting galaxy pair HCG 57A/D. These two spiral galaxies recently suffered an off-axis collision with HCG 57D passing through the disk of A. We find evidence of a gas bridge linking the galaxies, containing ~10^8 Msol of hot, ~1 keV thermal plasma and warm ionized gas radiating in H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [OIII] and [NII] lines. The optical emission lines in the central regions of HCG 57D show excitation properties consistent with HII-regions, while the outer rim of HCG 57D, parts of the bridge and the outer regions of HCG 57A show evidence of shocked gas consistent with shock velocities of 200-300 km/s. In contrast, the X-ray emitting gas requires a collision velocity of ~650-750 km/s to explain the observed temperatures. These different shock velocities can be reconciled by considering the contributions of rotation to collision velocity in different parts of the disks, and the clumpy nature of the pre-shock medium in the galaxies, which likely lead to different shock velocities in different components of the turbulent post-shocked gas. We examine the diffuse X-ray emission in the group members and their associated point sources, identifying X-ray AGN in HCG 57A, B, and D. We also confirm the previously reported ~1 keV intra-group medium and find it to be relaxed with a low central entropy (18.0+-1.7 kev cm^2 within 20 kpc) but a long cooling time (5.9+-0.8 Gyr).</description>

      <title>Color profiles of disk galaxies at $z=1$-$3$ observed with JWST: Implications for outer-disk formation histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the deconvolved color profiles of 223 disk galaxies at redshifts of $z=1$-3 observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey (CEERS). The filters were selected to approximate the rest-frame $B-Y$ color, which is used to identify U-shaped color profiles -- those becoming progressively bluer with increasing radius, then turning redder beyond a specific point. We find that 36% of Type II (down-bending) disks exhibit U-shaped color profiles with a minimum at or near the disk break. In contrast, no Type I (single-exponential) disks and only 9% of Type III (up-bending) disks show such a profile. The presence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks likely arises from the interplay between a star-formation threshold and spiral- or bar-driven secular radial migration of older stars outward. The fraction of Type II disks exhibiting a U-shaped color profile remains almost consistent across two redshift bins, $z=1$-$2$ and $z=2$-$3$, but is significantly lower than that observed in the local Universe, likely because the secular process of radial migration at high redshift may not have had sufficient time to significantly influence the disk structure. The absence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks could point to rapid rather than secular radial star migration potentially caused by violent clump instabilities, transporting both younger and older stars to the outer disk. Our results provide useful constraints on the formation and evolution models of disk galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the orbits of cluster galaxy populations according to their dominant gas ionization source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinematical and dynamical properties of cluster galaxy populations classified according to their dominant source of gas ionization, namely: star-forming (SF) galaxies, optical active galactic nuclei (AGN), mixed SF plus AGN ionization (transition objects, T), and quiescent (Q) galaxies. We stack 8892 member galaxies from 336 relaxed galaxy clusters to build an ensemble cluster and estimate the observed projected profiles of numerical density and velocity dispersion, $\sigma_P(R)$, of each galaxy population. The MAMPOSSt code and the Jeans equations inversion technique are used to constrain the velocity anisotropy profiles of the galaxy populations in both parametric and non-parametric ways. We find that Q (SF) galaxies display the lowest (highest) typical cluster-centric distances and velocity dispersion values. Transition galaxies are more concentrated and tend to exhibit lower velocity dispersion values than SF galaxies. Galaxies that host an optical AGN are as concentrated as Q galaxies but display velocity dispersion values similar to those of the SF population. MAMPOSSt is able to find equilibrium solutions that successfully recover the observed $\sigma_P(R)$ profile only for the Q, T, and AGN populations. We find that the orbits of all populations are consistent with isotropy in the inner regions, becoming increasingly radial with the distance from the cluster centre. These results suggest that Q galaxies are in equilibrium within their clusters, while SF galaxies have more recently arrived in the cluster environment. Finally, the T and AGN populations appear to be in an intermediate dynamical state between those of the SF and Q populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Dark Ages mark a pivotal era of the universe's evolution, transitioning from a neutral, opaque medium to the emergence of the first stars and galaxies that initiated cosmic reionization. This study examines the thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), molecular hydrogen cooling, and gravitational collapse that led to structure formation. Key emission lines, such as Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha $) and [C II] 158 $\mu m$, are analyzed as tracers of star formation, metallicity, and IGM conditions. Simulations highlight Ly$\alpha $ scattering profiles and [C II] emission as critical diagnostics of early galaxy evolution. The findings provide a theoretical framework to interpret high-redshift observations, advancing our understanding of the universe's transition from darkness to illumination.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytic Modeling of Dark Matter Subhalo Encounters with Thin Stellar Streams: Statistical Predictions for GD-1-like Streams in CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams from disrupted globular clusters are dynamically cold structures that are sensitive to perturbations from dark matter subhalos, allowing them in principle to trace the dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. We model, within the context of $\Lambda$CDM, the likelihood of dark matter subhalos to produce a significant feature in a GD-1-like stream and analyze the properties of such subhalos. We generate a large number of realizations of the subhalo population within a Milky Way mass host halo, accounting for tidal stripping and dynamical friction, using the semi-analytic code SatGen. The subhalo distributions are combined with a GD-1-like stream model, and the impact of subhalos that pass close to the stream are modeled with Gala. We find that subhalos with masses in the range $5\times 10^6 M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at the time of the stream-subhalo encounter, corresponding to masses of about $4 \times 10^7 M_{\odot} - 8 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at the time of infall, are the likeliest to produce gaps in a GD-1-like stream. We find that gaps occur on average $\sim$1.8 times per realization of the host system. These gaps have typical widths of $\sim(7 - 27)$ deg and fractional underdensities of $\sim (10 - 30)\%$, with larger gaps being caused by more-massive subhalos. The stream-subhalo encounters responsible for these have impact parameters $(0.1 - 1.5)$ kpc and relative velocities $\sim(170 - 410)$ km/s. For a larger host-halo mass, the number of subhalos increases, as do their typical velocities, inducing a corresponding increase in the number of significant stream-subhalo encounters.</description>

      <title>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, models have historically struggled to capture the observed rotational dispersion in stellar populations. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of ~7,400 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$ 15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages on our model's performance. These contribute an additional $\approx$ 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We estimate ages for the NGC 6709 open cluster and the Theia 456 stellar stream, and calculate revised rotational ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 1750, and NGC 1647. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow will be publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.</description>

      <title>A second candidate magnetic helium core white dwarf and 3 other variable white dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations, we report the discovery of four variable low-mass white dwarfs ($0.18 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 0.5 \,M_\odot$) in the globular cluster NGC 6397. One source exhibits a periodic optical modulation of $5.21 \pm 0.02$ hours, which we interpret as potentially due to the rotation of a magnetic helium core WD (He WD). This makes this candidate the second magnetic He WD in NGC 6397, and one of the few He WDs with a measured rotation period. The other three candidates show aperiodic variability, with a change in magnitude ranging from $\sim 0.11-0.6$. These discoveries highlight the importance of high-cadence photometric surveys in dense stellar environments. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm the nature of the variability of these systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi Unassociated Sources in the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over 2000 Gamma ray sources identified by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope are considered unassociated, meaning that they have no known counterparts in any other frequency regime. We have carried out an image-based search for steep spectrum radio sources, with in-band spectral index less than -1.4, within the error regions of Fermi unassociated sources using 1 to 1.4 GHz radio data from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS) Data Release. MALS DR1 with a median rms noise of 22 to 25 microJy and 735,649 sources is a significant advance over past image-based searches with improvements in sensitivity, resolution and bandwidth. Steep spectrum candidates were identified using a combination of in-band spectral indices from MALS and existing radio surveys. We developed an optical and infrared source classification scheme in order to distinguish between galactic pulsars and radio galaxies. In total, we identify nine pulsar candidates towards six Fermi sources that are worthy of follow-up for pulsation searches. We also report 41 steep spectrum radio galaxy candidates that may be of interest in searches for high-redshift radio galaxies. We show that MALS due to its excellent continuum sensitivity can detect 80 percent of the known pulsar population. This exhibits the promise of identifying exotic pulsar candidates with future image-based surveys with the Square Kilometre and its precursors.</description>

      <title>Modeling the UV/Optical light curve of re-brightening tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a new subclass of tidal disruption events (TDEs) was reported from the literature. The light curve of these TDEs show a re-brightening feature in the decline phase after the first peak, which then leads to a second flare. The re-brightening TDEs challenges the existing light curve fitting tools, which are designed to handle single flare. In this work, we present a model, aimed at reproducing of the light curve of the re-brightening TDEs, based on the scenario that the consecutive flares are produced by the same star who experienced two partial disruptions (PTDEs). We also develop a fitting code from this model, and apply it to two re-brightening TDEs: AT 2022dbl and AT 2023adr. The light curve of both TDEs are well fitted. Finally, we forecast the time and peak brightness of the next flare for these two TDEs, so that the observers could get prepared in advance and make an examination on our model.</description>

      <title>Minute-cadence observations on Galactic plane with Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST): Overview, methodology and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the time-domain survey telescope of the highest survey power in the northern hemisphere currently, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is scheduled to hourly/daily/semi-weekly scan northern sky up to ~23 mag in four optical (ugri) bands. Unlike the observation cadences in the forthcoming regular survey missions, WFST performed "staring" observations toward Galactic plane in a cadence of $\approx$1 minute for a total on-source time of about 13 hours, during the commissioning and pilot observation phases. Such an observation cadence is well applied in producing densely sampling light curves and hunting for stars exhibiting fast stellar variabilities. Here we introduce the primary methodologies in detecting variability, periodicity, and stellar flares among a half million sources from the minute-cadence observations, and present the WFST g-/r-band light curves generated from periodic variable stars and flaring stars. Benefit from high photometric precisions and deep detection limits of WFST, the observations have captured several rare variable stars, such as a variable hot white dwarf (WD) and an ellipsoidal WD binary candidate. By surveying the almost unexplored parameter spaces for variables, WFST will lead to new opportunities in discovering unique variable stars in the northern sky.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the planetary nebula nature of HaTr 5. Not the remnant of Nova Sco 1437</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of the nebula HaTr 5 with the shell remnant of the historic Nova Sco 1437 around the low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable 2MASS J17022815-4306123 has been used in the framework of the hibernation scenario to set an upper limit of &lt;580 yr to the transition time from a nova-like binary to a dwarf nova. This work aims at clarifying the nature of HaTr 5, which has also previously been proposed to be a possible planetary nebula. Intermediate- and high-dispersion long-slit spectra of HaTr\,5 have been obtained and analyzed in conjunction with archival optical and infrared images to investigate its spectral properties using photoionization models, to derive its H-alpha flux and ionized mass, and to determine its spatio-kinematic by means of 3D models to clarify its true nature. The H-alpha flux of HaTr 5 implies an ionized mass of 0.059 M_Sun at the 0.99 kpc distance of J170228, i.e., about 1000 times the typical ejecta of a nova. If HaTr\,5 were actually an unrelated planetary nebula, its H-alpha flux implies a distance of 2.25 kpc and an ionized mass of 0.47 M_Sun. The expansion velocity of HaTr 5 is found to be of 27 km/s, with a heliocentric radial velocity of -1 km/. The ionized mass of HaTr 5 and its expansion velocity (and associated kinematic age) are clearly inconsistent with those expected for a nova remnant, which all strongly support a planetary nebula nature. The association of J170228 with HaTr 5 is further called into question by their differing radial velocities and almost orthogonal motions on the plane of the sky. It is concluded that HaTr 5 is an old, evolved planetary nebula unrelated to the remnant of Nova Sco 1437 and to the cataclysmic variable J170228, the latter being by chance projected onto HaTr 5.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Low Angular Momentum Advective Flows onto Black Hole and associated observational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simulation results examining the presence and behavior of standing shocks in zero-energy low angular momentum advective accretion flows and explore their (in)stabilities properties taking into account various specific angular momentum, $\lambda_0$. Within the range $10-50R_g$ (where $R_g$ denotes the Schwarzschild radius), shocks are discernible for $\lambda_0\geq 1.75$. In the special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) simulation when $\lambda_0 = 1.80$, we find the merger of two shocks resulted in a dramatic increase in luminosity. We present the impact of external and internal flow collisions from the funnel region on luminosity. Notably, oscillatory behavior characterizes shocks within $1.70 \leq \lambda_0 \leq 1.80$. Using free-free emission as a proxy for analysis, we shows that the luminosity oscillations between frequencies of $0.1-10$ Hz for $\lambda_0$ range $1.7 \leq \lambda_0 \leq 1.80$. These findings offer insights into quasi-periodic oscillations emissions from certain black hole X-ray binaries, exemplified by GX 339-4. Furthermore, for the supermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center, Sgr A*, oscillation frequencies between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$ Hz were observed. This frequency range, translating to one cycle every few days, aligns with observational data from the X-ray telescopes such as Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton.</description>

      <title>COZMIC. III. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations of SIDM with Suppressed Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present eight cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like system that include suppression of the linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$, and/or velocity-dependent DM self-interactions, as the third installment of the COZMIC suite. We consider a model featuring a massive dark photon that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark fermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter perturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which ultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a velocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a cross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first time, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal evolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with present-day virial masses below $\approx 10^9~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. In simulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass (sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of core-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression. In particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints almost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less extreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\approx 20\%$ of subhalos and $\approx 5\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, and also increase the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos relative to SIDM. These results reveal a complex interplay between early and late-universe DM physics, revealing new discovery scenarios in the context of upcoming small-scale structure measurements.</description>

      <title>Origin of $\alpha$-Poor Very Metal-Poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among very metal-poor (VMP) stars, $\alpha$-poor VMP ($\alpha$PVMP) stars that have sub-solar values of ${\rm [X/Fe]}$ for Mg and other $\alpha$ elements are rare and are thought to have been formed from gas polluted by Type 1a supernova (SN 1a). However, recent analyses indicate that pure core-collapse supernova (CCSN) ejecta can also be a likely source. We perform a detailed analysis of 17 $\alpha$PVMP stars by considering six different scenarios relevant to the early Galaxy. We consider a single pair-instability supernova (PISN) and a single CCSN. Additionally, we consider the combination of ejecta from a CCSN with ejecta from another CCSN, a PISN, a near-Chandrasekhar mass (near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a, and a sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$) SN 1a. A clear signature can only be established for sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a with a near-smoking-gun signature in SDSSJ0018-0939 and a reasonably clear signature in ET0381. The majority ($82\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars can be explained by pure CCSN ejecta and do not require any SN 1a contribution. However, the combination of CCSN and sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a ejecta can also explain most ($76\%$) of $\alpha$PVMP stars. In contrast, the combination of ejecta from CCSN with near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a and PISN can fit $41\%$ and $29\%$ of the stars, respectively. The single PISN scenario is strongly ruled out for all stars. Our results indicate that $\alpha$PVMP stars are equally compatible with pure CCSN ejecta and a combination of CCSN and SN 1a ejecta, with sub-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a being roughly twice as frequent as near-${\rm M_{Ch}}$ SN 1a.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 catalogue includes line-broadening measurements (vbroad) for 3524677 stars. We concentrate here on the low-mass main-sequence sub-sample of the catalogue, with BP-RP in the range 1-1.6, which includes 81371 sources. The colour-magnitude diagram of the sample displays two distinct strips, the brighter of which is probably mostly composed of unresolved binaries with mass ratios close to unity. We show that the suspected binary sub-sample displays a larger vbroad distribution, which we attribute to the unresolved absorption lines of the two components of each binary. A similar effect is seen in the GALAH data.</description>

      <title>The Red Supergiant Progenitor of the Type II Supernova 2024abfl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linkage between core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and their progenitors is not fully understood and ongoing effort of searching and identifying the progenitors is needed. $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ is a recent Type II supernova exploded in the nearby star-bursting galaxy $\mathrm{NGC\,2146}$, which is also the host galaxy of $\mathrm{SN\,2018zd}$. From archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, we have found a red source ($\mathrm{m_{F814W} \sim 25}$) near the location (angular distance $\leq 0.2"$) of $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ before its explosion. With F814W and F606W photometry, we found that the properties of this source matched a typical red supergiant (RSG) moderately reddened by interstellar dust at the distance of the host galaxy. We conclude that the $\mathrm{SN\,2024abfl}$ had an RSG progenitor with initial mass of $\mathrm{10M_{\odot}}$--$\mathrm{16\,M_{\odot}}$.</description>

      <title>How the cool-core population transitions from galaxy groups to massive clusters: A comparison of the largest Magneticum simulation with eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Chandra and LOFAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our aim is to understand how the interplay between AGN feedback and merge processes can effectively turn cool-core galaxy clusters into hot-core clusters in the modern universe. Additionally, we also aim to clarify which parameters of the AGN feedback model used in simulations can cause an excess of feedback at the scale of galaxy groups while not efficiently suppressing star formation at the scale of galaxy clusters. To obtain robust statistics of the cool-core population, we compare the modern Universe snapshot (z=0.25) of the largest Magneticum simulation (Box2b/hr) with the eROSITA eFEDS survey and Planck SZ-selected clusters observed with XMM-Newton. Additionally, we compare the AGN feedback injected by the simulation in radio mode with Chandra observations of X-ray cavities, and LOFAR observations of radio emission. We confirm a decreasing trend in cool-core fractions towards the most massive galaxy clusters, which is well reproduced by the Magneticum simulations. This evolution is connected with an increased merge activity that injects high-energy particles into the core region, but it also requires thermalization and conductivity to enhance mixing through the ICM core, where both factors are increasingly efficient towards the high mass end. On the other hand, AGN feedback remains as the dominant factor at the scale of galaxy groups, while its relative impact decreases towards the most massive clusters. The problems suppressing star formation in simulations are not caused by low AGN feedback efficiencies. They root in the definition of the black hole sphere of influence used to distribute the feedback, which decreases as density and accretion rate increase. Actually, a decreasing AGN feedback efficiency towards low-mass galaxy groups is required to prevent overheating.</description>

      <title>Binary properties of the globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104). A dearth of short-period binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of binary stars in globular clusters are essential to shed light on the poorly constrained period, eccentricity, and mass ratio distributions and to develop an understanding of the formation of peculiar stellar objects. 47 Tuc (NGC 104) is one of the most massive Galactic globular clusters, with a large population of blue stragglers and with many predicted but as-yet elusive stellar-mass black holes. This makes it an exciting candidate for binary searches.
  We present a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of 47 Tuc with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph to determine radial velocity variations for 21,699 stars.
  We find a total binary fraction in the cluster of $(2.4\pm1.0)\%$, consistent with previous photometric estimates, and an increased binary fraction among blue straggler stars, approximately three times higher than the cluster average. We find very few binaries with periods below three days, and none with massive dark companions. A comparison with predictions from state-of-the-art models shows that the absence of such short-period binaries and of binaries with massive companions is surprising, highlighting the need to improve our understanding of stellar and dynamical evolution in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Between the Extremes: A JWST Spectroscopic Benchmark for High-redshift Galaxies Using ~500 Confirmed Sources at $z\geqslant5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exceptional spectra of the most luminous $z&gt;10$ sources observed so far have challenged our understanding of early galaxy evolution, requiring a new observational benchmark for meaningful interpretation. As such, we construct spectroscopic templates representative of high-redshift, star-forming populations, using 482 confirmed sources at $z=5.0-12.9$ with JWST/NIRSpec prism observations, and report on their average properties. We find $z=5-11$ galaxies are dominated by blue UV continuum slopes ($\beta=-2.3$ to $-2.7$) and reduced Balmer indices, characteristic of dust-poor and young systems, with a shift towards bluer slopes and younger ages with redshift. The evolution is mirrored by ubiquitous CIII] detections across all redshifts (rest-frame equivalent widths of $=5-14$ \r{A}), which increase in strength towards early times. Rest-frame optical lines reveal elevated ratios ($O32=7-31$, $R23=5-8$, and $Ne3O2=1-2$) and subsolar metallicities (log O/H$=7.3-7.9$), typical of ionization conditions and metallicities rarely observed in $z\sim0$ populations. Within our sample, we identify 57 Ly$\alpha$ emitters, which we stack and compare to a matched sample of nonemitters. The former are characterized by more extreme ionizing conditions with enhanced CIII], CIV, and HeII+[OIII] line emission, younger stellar populations from Balmer jumps, and a more pristine interstellar medium seen through bluer UV slopes and elevated rest-frame optical line ratios. The novel comparison illustrates important intrinsic differences between the two populations, with implications for Ly$\alpha$ visibility. The spectral templates derived here represent a new observational benchmark with which to interpret high-redshift sources, lifting our constraints on their global properties to unprecedented heights and extending out to the earliest of cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Detailed Study of Stars and Gas in a z = 8.3 Massive Merger with Extreme Dust Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present galaxy MACS0416-Y1 at z$_{\rm{spec}} = 8.312$ as observed by the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). MACS0416-Y1 has been shown to have extreme dust properties, thus, we study the physical properties and star formation histories of its resolved components. Overall, we find that MACS0416-Y1 is undergoing a star formation burst in three resolved clumps. The central clump is less massive compared to the other clumps and possibly formed in the merging process of the two larger clumps. Although the star formation history indicates an ongoing star formation burst, this gas-rich galaxy shows comparable star formation efficiency to cosmic noon galaxies. Using NIRSpec prism spectroscopy, we measure metallicity, $12 +\log\rm{(O/H)} = 7.76\pm0.03$ , ionisation parameter, $\log U = -2.48\pm0.03$, and electron temperature $\rm{T}_e = 18000\pm 4000 K $. The emission line ratios of the galaxy indicate an evolved Interstellar medium (ISM) similar to $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies. Further, we find possible presence of ionisation from an active galactic nuclei (AGN) using emission line diagnostics, however, we do not detect broad line component in H$\beta$ emission line. As this gas-rich galaxy is undergoing a major merger, we hypothesise that the high dust temperature in MACS0416-Y1 is caused by the star formation burst or a possible narrow-line AGN.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Pressure Support in Galaxy Clusters -- Impact of the Hydrodynamical Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of turbulent pressure in galaxy clusters is still debated, especially as for the impact of the dynamical state and the hydro-method used for simulations. We study the turbulent pressure fraction in the intra cluster medium of massive galaxy clusters. We aim to understand the impact of the hydrodynamical scheme, analysis method, and dynamical state on the final properties of galaxy clusters from cosmological simulations. We perform non-radiative simulations of a set of zoom-in regions of seven galaxy clusters with Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We use three different analysis methods based on: $(i)$ the deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium, $(ii)$ the solenoidal velocity component obtained by a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, and $(iii)$ the small-scale velocity obtained through a multi-scale filtering approach. We split the sample of simulated clusters into active and relaxed clusters. Our simulations predict an increased turbulent pressure fraction for active compared to relaxed clusters. This is especially visible for the velocity-based methods. For these, we also find increased turbulence for the MFM simulations compared to SPH, consistent with findings from more idealized simulations. The predicted non-thermal pressure fraction varies between a few percent for relaxed clusters and $\approx13\%$ for active ones within the cluster center and increases towards the outskirts. No clear trend with redshift is visible. Our analysis quantitatively assesses the importance played by the hydrodynamical scheme and the analysis method to determine the non-thermal/turbulent pressure fraction. While our setup is relatively simple (non-radiative runs), our simulations show agreement with previous, more idealized simulations, and make a step further toward the understanding of turbulence.</description>

      <title>A sensitivity curve approach to tuning a pulsar timing array in the detection era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) transition into the detection era of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), it is important for PTA collaborations to review and possibly revise their observing campaigns. The detection of a ''single source'' would be a boon for gravitational astrophysics, as such a source would emit gravitational waves for millions of years in the PTA frequency band. Here we present generic methods for studying the effects of various observational strategies, taking advantage of detector sensitivity curves, i.e., noise-averaged, frequency-domain detection statistics. The statistical basis for these methods is presented along with myriad examples of how to tune a detector towards single, deterministic signals or a stochastic background. We demonstrate that trading observations of the worst pulsars for high cadence campaigns on the best pulsars increases sensitivity to single sources at high frequencies while hedging losses in GWB and single source sensitivity at low frequencies. We also find that sky-targeted observing campaigns yield minimal sensitivity improvements compared with other PTA tuning options. Lastly, we show the importance of the uncorrelated half of the GWB, i.e. the pulsar-term, as an increasingly prominent sources of noise and show the impact of this emerging noise source on various PTA configurations.</description>

      <title>Can slow pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters form via partial recycling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4\,$s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ''partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-1609Lb: Sub-jovian planet orbiting a low-mass stellar or brown dwarf host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of a planetary microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1609. The planetary anomaly was detected by two survey telescopes, OGLE and MOA. Each of these surveys collected enough data over the planetary anomaly to allow for an unambiguous planet detection. Such survey detections of planetary anomalies are needed to build a robust sample of planets that could improve studies on the microlensing planetary occurrence rate by reducing biases and statistical uncertainties. In this work, we examined different methods for modeling microlensing events using individual datasets, particularly we incorporated a Galactic model prior to better constrain poorly defined microlensing parallax. Ultimately, we fitted a comprehensive model to all available data, identifying three potential typologies, with two showing comparably high Bayesian evidence. Our analysis indicates that the host of the planet is a brown dwarf with a probability of 34%, or a low-mass stellar object (M-dwarf) with the probability of 66%.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Merger Rates in AGN: contribution from gas-captured binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that merging black hole (BH) binaries in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs formed through two-body scatterings via the gas-capture process may explain a significant fraction of BH mergers in AGN and a non-negligible contribution to the observed rate from LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of BH and binary BH formation, evolution and mergers across the observed AGN mass function using a novel physically motivated treatment for the gas-capture process derived from hydrodynamical simulations of BH-BH encounters in AGN and varying assumptions on the AGN disc physics. The results suggest that gas-captured binaries could result in merger rates of 0.73 - 7.1Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. Most mergers take place near the outer boundary of the accretion disk, but this may be subject to change when migration is considered. The BH merger rate in the AGN channel in the Universe is dominated by AGN with supermassive BH masses on the order of 10$^{7} M_\odot$ , with 90% of mergers occurring in the range 10$^{6} M_\odot$ - 10$^{8} M_\odot$ . The merging mass distribution is flatter than the initial BH mass power law by a factor $\Delta \xi$ = 1.1 to 1.2, as larger BHs can align with the disc and successfully form binaries more efficiently. Similarly, the merging mass ratio distribution is flatter, therefore the AGN channel could easily explain the high mass and unequal mass ratio detections such as GW190521 and GW190814. When modelling the BH binary formation process using a simpler dynamical friction treatment, we observe very similar results, where the primary bottleneck is the alignment time with the disk. We find the most influential parameters on the rates are the anticipated number of BHs and their mass function. We conclude that AGN remain an important channel for consideration, particularly for gravitational wave detections involving one or two high mass BHs.</description>
