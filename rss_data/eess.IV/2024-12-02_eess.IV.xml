      <title>CovHuSeg: An Enhanced Approach for Kidney Pathology Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation has long been essential in computer vision due to its numerous real-world applications. However, most traditional deep learning and machine learning models need help to capture geometric features such as size and convexity of the segmentation targets, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To resolve this problem, we propose using a CovHuSeg algorithm to solve the problem of kidney glomeruli segmentation. This simple post-processing method is specified to adapt to the segmentation of ball-shaped anomalies, including the glomerulus. Unlike other post-processing methods, the CovHuSeg algorithm assures that the outcome mask does not have holes in it or comes in unusual shapes that are impossible to be the shape of a glomerulus. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method by experimenting with multiple deep-learning models in the context of segmentation on kidney pathology images. The results show that all models have increased accuracy when using the CovHuSeg algorithm.</description>

      <title>Deep Plug-and-Play HIO Approach for Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the phase retrieval problem, the aim is the recovery of an unknown image from intensity-only measurements such as Fourier intensity. Although there are several solution approaches, solving this problem is challenging due to its nonlinear and ill-posed nature. Recently, learning-based approaches have emerged as powerful alternatives to the analytical methods for several inverse problems. In the context of phase retrieval, a novel plug-and-play approach that exploits learning-based prior and e!cient update steps has been presented at the Computational Optical Sensing and Imaging topical meeting, with demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. The key idea was to incorporate learning-based prior to the hybrid input-output method (HIO) through plug-and-play regularization. In this paper, we present the mathematical development of the method including the derivation of its analytical update steps based on half-quadratic splitting and comparatively evaluate its performance through extensive simulations on a large test dataset. The results show the e"ectiveness of the method in terms of both image quality, computational e!ciency, and robustness to initialization and noise.</description>

      <title>FiRe: Fixed-points of Restoration Priors for Solving Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting an appropriate prior to compensate for information loss due to the measurement operator is a fundamental challenge in imaging inverse problems. Implicit priors based on denoising neural networks have become central to widely-used frameworks such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fixed-points of Restoration (FiRe) priors as a new framework for expanding the notion of priors in PnP to general restoration models beyond traditional denoising models. The key insight behind FiRe is that natural images emerge as fixed points of the composition of a degradation operator with the corresponding restoration model. This enables us to derive an explicit formula for our implicit prior by quantifying invariance of images under this composite operation. Adopting this fixed-point perspective, we show how various restoration networks can effectively serve as priors for solving inverse problems. The FiRe framework further enables ensemble-like combinations of multiple restoration models as well as acquisition-informed restoration networks, all within a unified optimization approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of FiRe across various inverse problems, establishing a new paradigm for incorporating pretrained restoration models into PnP-like algorithms.</description>

      <title>FAN-Unet: Enhancing Unet with vision Fourier Analysis Block for Biomedical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical aspect of modern medical research and clinical practice. Despite the remarkable performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in this domain, they inherently struggle to capture long-range dependencies within images. Transformers, on the other hand, are naturally adept at modeling global context but often face challenges in capturing local features effectively. Therefore, we presents FAN-UNet, a novel architecture that combines the strengths of Fourier Analysis Network (FAN)-based vision backbones and the U-Net architecture, effectively addressing the challenges of long-range dependency and periodicity modeling in biomedical image segmentation tasks. The proposed Vision-FAN layer integrates the FAN layer and self-attention mechanisms, leveraging Fourier analysis to enable the model to effectively capture both long-range dependencies and periodic relationships. Extensive experiments on various medical imaging datasets demonstrate that FAN-UNet achieves a favorable balance between model complexity and performance, validating its effectiveness and practicality for medical image segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Voxel-based Differentiable X-ray Rendering Improves Self-Supervised 3D CBCT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework for Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) reconstruction by directly optimizing a voxelgrid representation using physics-based differentiable X-ray rendering. Further, we investigate how the different formulations of X-ray image formation physics in the renderer affect the quality of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. When combined with our regularized voxelgrid-based learning framework, we find that using an exact discretization of the Beer-Lambert law for X-ray attenuation in the renderer outperforms widely used iterative CBCT reconstruction algorithms, particularly when given only a few input views. As a result, we reconstruct high-fidelity 3D CBCT volumes from fewer X-rays, potentially reducing ionizing radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Upsampling Improvement for Overfitted Neural Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural image compression, based on auto-encoders and overfitted representations, relies on a latent representation of the coded signal. This representation needs to be compact and uses low resolution feature maps. In the decoding process, those latents are upsampled and filtered using stacks of convolution filters and non linear elements to recover the decoded image.
  Therefore, the upsampling process is crucial in the design of a neural coding scheme and is of particular importance for overfitted codecs where the network parameters, including the upsampling filters, are part of the representation.
  This paper addresses the improvement of the upsampling process in order to reduce its complexity and limit the number of parameters. A new upsampling structure is presented whose improvements are illustrated within the Cool-Chic overfitted image coding framework. The proposed approach offers a rate reduction of 4.7%. The code is provided.</description>

      <title>Skeleton Detection Using Dual Radars with Integration of Dual-View CNN Models and mmPose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skeleton detection is a technique that can beapplied to a variety of situations. It is especially critical identifying and tracking the movements of the elderly, especially in real-time fall detection. While conventional image processing methods exist, there's a growing preference for utilizing pointclouds data collected by mmWave radars from viewpoint of privacy protection, offering a non-intrusive approach to elevatesafety and care for the elderly. Dealing with point cloud data necessitates addressing three critical considerations. Firstly, the inherent nature of point clouds -- rotation invariance, translation invariance, and locality -- is managed through the fusion of PointNet and mmPose. PointNet ensures rotational and translational invariance, while mmPose addresses locality. Secondly, the limited points per frame from radar require data integration from two radars to enhance skeletal detection. Lastly,inputting point cloud data into the learning model involves utilizing features like coordinates, velocity, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per radar point to mitigate sparsity issues and reduce computational load. This research proposes three Dual ViewCNN models, combining PointNet and mmPose, employing two mmWave radars, with performance comparisons in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). While the proposed model shows suboptimal results for random walking, it excels in the arm swing case.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Model for Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In learned image compression, probabilistic models play an essential role in characterizing the distribution of latent variables. The Gaussian model with mean and scale parameters has been widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness. Probabilistic models with more parameters, such as the Gaussian mixture models, can fit the distribution of latent variables more precisely, but the corresponding complexity will also be higher. To balance between compression performance and complexity, we extend the Gaussian model to the generalized Gaussian model for more flexible latent distribution modeling, introducing only one additional shape parameter, beta, than the Gaussian model. To enhance the performance of the generalized Gaussian model by alleviating the train-test mismatch, we propose improved training methods, including beta-dependent lower bounds for scale parameters and gradient rectification. Our proposed generalized Gaussian model, coupled with the improved training methods, is demonstrated to outperform the Gaussian and Gaussian mixture models on a variety of learned image compression methods.</description>

      <title>3D Wasserstein generative adversarial network with dense U-Net based discriminator for preclinical fMRI denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is extensively used in clinical and preclinical settings to study brain function, however, fMRI data is inherently noisy due to physiological processes, hardware, and external noise. Denoising is one of the main preprocessing steps in any fMRI analysis pipeline. This process is challenging in preclinical data in comparison to clinical data due to variations in brain geometry, image resolution, and low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserved algorithm based on a 3D Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a 3D dense U-net based discriminator called, 3D U-WGAN. We apply a 4D data configuration to effectively denoise temporal and spatial information in analyzing preclinical fMRI data. GAN-based denoising methods often utilize a discriminator to identify significant differences between denoised and noise-free images, focusing on global or local features. To refine the fMRI denoising model, our method employs a 3D dense U-Net discriminator to learn both global and local distinctions. To tackle potential over-smoothing, we introduce an adversarial loss and enhance perceptual similarity by measuring feature space distances. Experiments illustrate that 3D U-WGAN significantly improves image quality in resting-state and task preclinical fMRI data, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio without introducing excessive structural changes in existing methods. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to simulated and real data in a fMRI analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>MCUCoder: Adaptive Bitrate Learned Video Compression for IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of camera-based IoT devices demands the need for efficient video compression, particularly for edge applications where devices face hardware constraints, often with only 1 or 2 MB of RAM and unstable internet connections. Traditional and deep video compression methods are designed for high-end hardware, exceeding the capabilities of these constrained devices. Consequently, video compression in these scenarios is often limited to M-JPEG due to its high hardware efficiency and low complexity. This paper introduces , an open-source adaptive bitrate video compression model tailored for resource-limited IoT settings. MCUCoder features an ultra-lightweight encoder with only 10.5K parameters and a minimal 350KB memory footprint, making it well-suited for edge devices and MCUs. While MCUCoder uses a similar amount of energy as M-JPEG, it reduces bitrate by 55.65% on the MCL-JCV dataset and 55.59% on the UVG dataset, measured in MS-SSIM. Moreover, MCUCoder supports adaptive bitrate streaming by generating a latent representation that is sorted by importance, allowing transmission based on available bandwidth. This ensures smooth real-time video transmission even under fluctuating network conditions on low-resource devices. Source code available at https://github.com/ds-kiel/MCUCoder.</description>

      <title>Blurred LiDAR for Sharper 3D: Robust Handheld 3D Scanning with Diffuse LiDAR and RGB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D surface reconstruction is essential across applications of virtual reality, robotics, and mobile scanning. However, RGB-based reconstruction often fails in low-texture, low-light, and low-albedo scenes. Handheld LiDARs, now common on mobile devices, aim to address these challenges by capturing depth information from time-of-flight measurements of a coarse grid of projected dots. Yet, these sparse LiDARs struggle with scene coverage on limited input views, leaving large gaps in depth information. In this work, we propose using an alternative class of "blurred" LiDAR that emits a diffuse flash, greatly improving scene coverage but introducing spatial ambiguity from mixed time-of-flight measurements across a wide field of view. To handle these ambiguities, we propose leveraging the complementary strengths of diffuse LiDAR with RGB. We introduce a Gaussian surfel-based rendering framework with a scene-adaptive loss function that dynamically balances RGB and diffuse LiDAR signals. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, diffuse LiDAR can outperform traditional sparse LiDAR, enabling robust 3D scanning with accurate color and geometry estimation in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing AI microscopy for foodborne bacterial classification via adversarial domain adaptation across optical and biological variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid detection of foodborne bacteria is critical for food safety and quality, yet traditional culture-based methods require extended incubation and specialized sample preparation. This study addresses these challenges by i) enhancing the generalizability of AI-enabled microscopy for bacterial classification using adversarial domain adaptation and ii) comparing the performance of single-target and multi-domain adaptation. Three Gram-positive (Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua) and three Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium) strains were classified. EfficientNetV2 served as the backbone architecture, leveraging fine-grained feature extraction for small targets. Few-shot learning enabled scalability, with domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) addressing single domains and multi-DANNs (MDANNs) generalizing across all target domains. The model was trained on source domain data collected under controlled conditions (phase contrast microscopy, 60x magnification, 3-h bacterial incubation) and evaluated on target domains with variations in microscopy modality (brightfield, BF), magnification (20x), and extended incubation to compensate for lower resolution (20x-5h). DANNs improved target domain classification accuracy by up to 54.45% (20x), 43.44% (20x-5h), and 31.67% (BF), with minimal source domain degradation (&lt;4.44%). MDANNs achieved superior performance in the BF domain and substantial gains in the 20x domain. Grad-CAM and t-SNE visualizations validated the model's ability to learn domain-invariant features across diverse conditions. This study presents a scalable and adaptable framework for bacterial classification, reducing reliance on extensive sample preparation and enabling application in decentralized and resource-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Contextual Checkerboard Denoise -- A Novel Neural Network-Based Approach for Classification-Aware OCT Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to non-medical image denoising, where enhancing image clarity is the primary goal, medical image denoising warrants preservation of crucial features without introduction of new artifacts. However, many denoising methods that improve the clarity of the image, inadvertently alter critical information of the denoised images, potentially compromising classification performance and diagnostic quality. Additionally, supervised denoising methods are not very practical in medical image domain, since a \emph{ground truth} denoised version of a noisy medical image is often extremely challenging to obtain. In this paper, we tackle both of these problems by introducing a novel neural network based method -- \emph{Contextual Checkerboard Denoising}, that can learn denoising from only a dataset of noisy images, while preserving crucial anatomical details necessary for image classification/analysis. We perform our experimentation on real Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images, and empirically demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves image quality, providing clearer and more detailed OCT images, while enhancing diagnostic accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Automated Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces in Brain MRI with the nnU-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Enlargement of perivascular spaces (PVS) is common in neurodegenerative disorders including cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. PVS enlargement may indicate impaired clearance pathways and there is a need for reliable PVS detection methods which are currently lacking. Aim: To optimise a widely used deep learning model, the no-new-UNet (nnU-Net), for PVS segmentation. Methods: In 30 healthy participants (mean$\pm$SD age: 50$\pm$18.9 years; 13 females), T1-weighted MRI images were acquired using three different protocols on three MRI scanners (3T Siemens Tim Trio, 3T Philips Achieva, and 7T Siemens Magnetom). PVS were manually segmented across ten axial slices in each participant. Segmentations were completed using a sparse annotation strategy. In total, 11 models were compared using various strategies for image handling, preprocessing and semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels. Model performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation (5FCV). The main performance metric was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results: The voxel-spacing agnostic model (mean$\pm$SD DSC=64.3$\pm$3.3%) outperformed models which resampled images to a common resolution (DSC=40.5-55%). Model performance improved substantially following iterative label cleaning (DSC=85.7$\pm$1.2%). Semi-supervised learning with pseudo-labels (n=12,740) from 18 additional datasets improved the agreement between raw and predicted PVS cluster counts (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient=0.89, 95%CI=0.82-0.94). We extended the model to enable PVS segmentation in the midbrain (DSC=64.3$\pm$6.5%) and hippocampus (DSC=67.8$\pm$5%). Conclusions: Our deep learning models provide a robust and holistic framework for the automated quantification of PVS in brain MRI.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Denoiser Framework</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing images using Computed Tomography (CT) in an industrial context leads to specific challenges that differ from those encountered in other areas, such as clinical CT. Indeed, non-destructive testing with industrial CT will often involve scanning multiple similar objects while maintaining high throughput, requiring short scanning times, which is not a relevant concern in clinical CT. Under-sampling the tomographic data (sinograms) is a natural way to reduce the scanning time at the cost of image quality since the latter depends on the number of measurements. In such a scenario, post-processing techniques are required to compensate for the image artifacts induced by the sinogram sparsity. We introduce the Self-supervised Denoiser Framework (SDF), a self-supervised training method that leverages pre-training on highly sampled sinogram data to enhance the quality of images reconstructed from undersampled sinogram data. The main contribution of SDF is that it proposes to train an image denoiser in the sinogram space by setting the learning task as the prediction of one sinogram subset from another. As such, it does not require ground-truth image data, leverages the abundant data modality in CT, the sinogram, and can drastically enhance the quality of images reconstructed from a fraction of the measurements. We demonstrate that SDF produces better image quality, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio, than other analytical and self-supervised frameworks in both 2D fan-beam or 3D cone-beam CT settings. Moreover, we show that the enhancement provided by SDF carries over when fine-tuning the image denoiser on a few examples, making it a suitable pre-training technique in a context where there is little high-quality image data. Our results are established on experimental datasets, making SDF a strong candidate for being the building block of foundational image-enhancement models in CT.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Whole Slide Foundation Model for Pathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</description>

      <title>Random Walks with Tweedie: A Unified Framework for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple template for designing generative diffusion model algorithms based on an interpretation of diffusion sampling as a sequence of random walks. Score-based diffusion models are widely used to generate high-quality images. Diffusion models have also been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in many inverse problems. While these algorithms are often surprisingly simple, the theory behind them is not, and multiple complex theoretical justifications exist in the literature. Here, we provide a simple and largely self-contained theoretical justification for score-based-diffusion models that avoids using the theory of Markov chains or reverse diffusion, instead centering the theory of random walks and Tweedie's formula. This approach leads to unified algorithmic templates for network training and sampling. In particular, these templates cleanly separate training from sampling, e.g., the noise schedule used during training need not match the one used during sampling. We show that several existing diffusion models correspond to particular choices within this template and demonstrate that other, more straightforward algorithmic choices lead to effective diffusion models. The proposed framework has the added benefit of enabling conditional sampling without any likelihood approximation.</description>

      <title>MRI Breast tissue segmentation using nnU-Net for biomechanical modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating 2D mammography with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. However, this integration is challenging due to differences in imaging modalities and the need for precise tissue segmentation and alignment. This paper addresses these challenges by enhancing biomechanical breast models in two main aspects: improving tissue identification using nnU-Net segmentation models and evaluating finite element (FE) biomechanical solvers, specifically comparing NiftySim and FEBio. We performed a detailed six-class segmentation of breast MRI data using the nnU-Net architecture, achieving Dice Coefficients of 0.94 for fat, 0.88 for glandular tissue, and 0.87 for pectoral muscle. The overall foreground segmentation reached a mean Dice Coefficient of 0.83 through an ensemble of 2D and 3D U-Net configurations, providing a solid foundation for 3D reconstruction and biomechanical modeling. The segmented data was then used to generate detailed 3D meshes and develop biomechanical models using NiftySim and FEBio, which simulate breast tissue's physical behaviors under compression. Our results include a comparison between NiftySim and FEBio, providing insights into the accuracy and reliability of these simulations in studying breast tissue responses under compression. The findings of this study have the potential to improve the integration of 2D and 3D imaging modalities, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for breast cancer.</description>

      <title>On-chip Hyperspectral Image Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks for Scene Understanding in Autonomous Driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of current computer vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) perform detection and tracking of objects quite successfully under regular conditions. However, under adverse weather and changing lighting conditions, and in complex situations with many overlapping objects, these systems are not completely reliable. The spectral reflectance of the different objects in a driving scene beyond the visible spectrum can offer additional information to increase the reliability of these systems, especially under challenging driving conditions. Furthermore, this information may be significant enough to develop vision systems that allow for a better understanding and interpretation of the whole driving scene. In this work we explore the use of snapshot, video-rate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cameras in ADAS on the assumption that the near infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance of different materials can help to better segment the objects in real driving scenarios. To do this, we have used the HSI-Drive 1.1 dataset to perform various experiments on spectral classification algorithms. However, the information retrieval of hyperspectral recordings in natural outdoor scenarios is challenging, mainly because of deficient colour constancy and other inherent shortcomings of current snapshot HSI technology, which poses some limitations to the development of pure spectral classifiers. In consequence, in this work we analyze to what extent the spatial features codified by standard, tiny fully convolutional network (FCN) models can improve the performance of HSI segmentation systems for ADAS applications.

      <title>Any-Resolution AI-Generated Image Detection by Spectral Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.</description>

      <title>Using UK Biobank data to establish population-specific atlases from whole body MRI</title>

Abstract: Reliable reference data in medical imaging is largely unavailable. Developing tools that allow for the comparison of individual patient data to reference data has a high potential to improve diagnostic imaging. Population atlases are a commonly used tool in medical imaging to facilitate this. Constructing such atlases becomes particularly challenging when working with highly heterogeneous datasets, such as whole-body images, which contain significant anatomical variations. In this work, we propose a pipeline for generating a standardised whole-body atlas for a highly heterogeneous population by partitioning the population into anatomically meaningful subgroups. Using magnetic resonance images from the UK Biobank dataset, we create six whole-body atlases representing a healthy population average. We furthermore unbias them, and this way obtain a realistic representation of the population. In addition to the anatomical atlases, we generate probabilistic atlases that capture the distributions of abdominal fat (visceral and subcutaneous) and five abdominal organs across the population (liver, spleen, pancreas, left and right kidneys). Our pipeline effectively generates high-quality, realistic whole-body atlases with clinical applicability. The probabilistic atlases show differences in fat distribution between subjects with medical conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases and healthy subjects in the atlas space. With this work, we make the constructed anatomical and label atlases publically available, with the expectation that they will support medical research involving whole-body MR images.</description>

Abstract: \hspace{2mm} Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) of the brain offers unique capabilities including noninvasive probing of tissue microstructure and structural connectivity. It is widely used for clinical assessment of disease and injury, and for neuroscience research. Analyzing the dMRI data to extract useful information for medical and scientific purposes can be challenging. The dMRI measurements may suffer from strong noise and artifacts, and may exhibit high inter-session and inter-scanner variability in the data, as well as inter-subject heterogeneity in brain structure. Moreover, the relationship between measurements and the phenomena of interest can be highly complex. Recent years have witnessed increasing use of machine learning methods for dMRI analysis. This manuscript aims to assess these efforts, with a focus on methods that have addressed data preprocessing and harmonization, microstructure mapping, tractography, and white matter tract analysis. We study the main findings, strengths, and weaknesses of the existing methods and suggest topics for future research. We find that machine learning may be exceptionally suited to tackle some of the difficult tasks in dMRI analysis. However, for this to happen, several shortcomings of existing methods and critical unresolved issues need to be addressed. There is a pressing need to improve evaluation practices, to increase the availability of rich training datasets and validation benchmarks, as well as model generalizability, reliability, and explainability concerns.</description>

Abstract: Learning-based Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to standard video codecs, demonstrating promising performance, and simple and easily maintainable pipelines. However, NVCs often fall short of compression performance and occasionally exhibit poor generalization capability due to inference-only compression scheme and their dependence on training data. The instance-adaptive video compression techniques have recently been suggested as a viable solution, fine-tuning the encoder or decoder networks for a particular test instance video. However, fine-tuning all the model parameters incurs high computational costs, increases the bitrates, and often leads to unstable training. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient instance-adaptive video compression framework. Inspired by the remarkable success of parameter-efficient fine-tuning on large-scale neural network models, we propose to use a lightweight adapter module that can be easily attached to the pretrained NVCs and fine-tuned for test video sequences. The resulting algorithm significantly improves compression performance and reduces the encoding time compared to the existing instant-adaptive video compression algorithms. Furthermore, the suggested fine-tuning method enhances the robustness of the training process, allowing for the proposed method to be widely used in many practical settings. We conducted extensive experiments on various standard benchmark datasets, including UVG, MCL-JVC, and HEVC sequences, and the experimental results have shown a significant improvement in rate-distortion (RD) curves (up to 5 dB PSNR) and BD rates compared to the baselines NVC.

      <title>STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</description>

      <title>Combining Pre- and Post-Demosaicking Noise Removal for RAW Video</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising is one of the fundamental steps of the processing pipeline that converts data captured by a camera sensor into a display-ready image or video. It is generally performed early in the pipeline, usually before demosaicking, although studies swapping their order or even conducting them jointly have been proposed. With the advent of deep learning, the quality of denoising algorithms has steadily increased. Even so, modern neural networks still have a hard time adapting to new noise levels and scenes, which is indispensable for real-world applications. With those in mind, we propose a self-similarity-based denoising scheme that weights both a pre- and a post-demosaicking denoiser for Bayer-patterned CFA video data. We show that a balance between the two leads to better image quality, and we empirically find that higher noise levels benefit from a higher influence pre-demosaicking. We also integrate temporal trajectory prefiltering steps before each denoiser, which further improve texture reconstruction. The proposed method only requires an estimation of the noise model at the sensor, accurately adapts to any noise level, and is competitive with the state of the art, making it suitable for real-world videography.</description>

      <title>CT-Mamba: A Hybrid Convolutional State Space Model for Low-Dose CT Denoising</title>

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) significantly reduces the radiation dose received by patients, however, dose reduction introduces additional noise and artifacts. Currently, denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) face limitations in long-range modeling capabilities, while Transformer-based denoising methods, although capable of powerful long-range modeling, suffer from high computational complexity. Furthermore, the denoised images predicted by deep learning-based techniques inevitably exhibit differences in noise distribution compared to normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which can also impact the final image quality and diagnostic outcomes. This paper proposes CT-Mamba, a hybrid convolutional State Space Model for LDCT image denoising. The model combines the local feature extraction advantages of CNNs with Mamba's strength in capturing long-range dependencies, enabling it to capture both local details and global context. Additionally, we introduce an innovative spatially coherent 'Z'-shaped scanning scheme to ensure spatial continuity between adjacent pixels in the image. We design a Mamba-driven deep noise power spectrum (NPS) loss function to guide model training, ensuring that the noise texture of the denoised LDCT images closely resembles that of NDCT images, thereby enhancing overall image quality and diagnostic value. Experimental results have demonstrated that CT-Mamba performs excellently in reducing noise in LDCT images, enhancing detail preservation, and optimizing noise texture distribution, and exhibits higher statistical similarity with the radiomics features of NDCT images. The proposed CT-Mamba demonstrates outstanding performance in LDCT denoising and holds promise as a representative approach for applying the Mamba framework to LDCT denoising tasks. Our code will be made available after the paper is officially published: https://github.com/zy2219105/CT-Mamba/.</description>

      <title>J-Invariant Volume Shuffle for Self-Supervised Cryo-Electron Tomogram Denoising on Single Noisy Volume</title>

Abstract: Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) enables detailed 3D visualization of cellular structures in near-native states but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio due to imaging constraints. Traditional denoising methods and supervised learning approaches often struggle with complex noise patterns and the lack of paired datasets. Self-supervised methods, which utilize noisy input itself as a target, have been studied; however, existing Cryo-ET self-supervised denoising methods face significant challenges due to losing information during training and the learned incomplete noise patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning model that denoises Cryo-ET volumetric images using a single noisy volume. Our method features a U-shape J-invariant blind spot network with sparse centrally masked convolutions, dilated channel attention blocks, and volume unshuffle/shuffle technique. The volume-unshuffle/shuffle technique expands receptive fields and utilizes multi-scale representations, significantly improving noise reduction and structural preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, advancing Cryo-ET data processing for structural biology research</description>

      <title>PromptHSI: Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration Framework for Composite Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in All-in-One (AiO) RGB image restoration and prompt learning have enabled the representation of distinct degradations through prompts, allowing degraded images to be effectively addressed by a single restoration model. However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications. The source code and dataset will be publicly released.</description>
