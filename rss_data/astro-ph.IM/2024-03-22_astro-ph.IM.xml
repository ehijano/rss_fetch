      <title>Joint Deconvolution of Astronomical Images in the Presence of Poisson Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for joint likelihood deconvolution (Jolideco) of a set of astronomical observations of the same sky region in the presence of Poisson noise. The observations may be obtained from different instruments with different resolution, and different point spread functions. Jolideco reconstructs a single flux image by optimizing the posterior distribution based on the joint Poisson likelihood of all observations under a patch-based image prior. The patch prior is parameterised via a Gaussian Mixture model which we train on high-signal-to-noise astronomical images, including data from the James Webb Telescope and the GLEAM radio survey. This prior favors correlation structures among the reconstructed pixel intensities that are characteristic of those observed in the training images. It is, however, not informative for the mean or scale of the reconstruction. By applying the method to simulated data we show that the combination of multiple observations and the patch-based prior leads to much improved reconstruction quality in many different source scenarios and signal to noise regimes. We demonstrate that with the patch prior Jolideco yields superior reconstruction quality relative to alternative standard methods such as the Richardson-Lucy method. We illustrate the results of Jolideco applied to example data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By comparing the measured width of a counts based and the corresponding Jolideco flux profile of an X-ray filament in SNR 1E 0102.2-721} we find the deconvolved width of 0.58+- 0.02 arcsec to be consistent with the theoretical expectation derived from the known width of the PSF.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.</description>

      <title>PINNferring the Hubble Function with Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble function characterizes a given Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime and can be related to the densities of the cosmological fluids and their equations of state. We show how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) emulate this dynamical system and provide fast predictions of the luminosity distance for a given choice of densities and equations of state, as needed for the analysis of supernova data. We use this emulator to perform a model-independent and parameter-free reconstruction of the Hubble function on the basis of supernova data. As part of this study, we develop and validate an uncertainty treatment for PINNs using a heteroscedastic loss and repulsive ensembles.</description>

      <title>A Gap in the Densities of Small Planets Orbiting M Dwarfs: Rigorous Statistical Confirmation Using the Open-source Code RhoPop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using mass-radius-composition models, small planets ($\mathrm{R}\lesssim 2 \mathrm{R_\oplus}$) are typically classified into three types: iron-rich, nominally Earth-like, and those with solid/liquid water and/or atmosphere. These classes are generally expected to be variations within a compositional continuum. Recently, however, Luque &amp; Pall\'e observed that potentially Earth-like planets around M dwarfs are separated from a lower-density population by a density gap. Meanwhile, the results of Adibekyan et al. hint that iron-rich planets around FGK stars are also a distinct population. It therefore remains unclear whether small planets represent a continuum or multiple distinct populations. Differentiating the nature of these populations will help constrain potential formation mechanisms. We present the RhoPop software for identifying small-planet populations. RhoPop employs mixture models in a hierarchical framework and a nested sampler for parameter and evidence estimates. Using RhoPop, we confirm the two populations of Luque &amp; Pall\'e with $&gt;4\sigma$ significance. The intrinsic scatter in the Earth-like subpopulation is roughly half that expected based on stellar abundance variations in local FGK stars, perhaps implying M dwarfs have a smaller spread in the major rock-building elements (Fe, Mg, Si) than FGK stars. We apply RhoPop to the Adibekyan et al. sample and find no evidence of more than one population. We estimate the sample size required to resolve a population of planets with Mercury-like compositions from those with Earth-like compositions for various mass-radius precisions. Only 16 planets are needed when $\sigma_{M_p} = 5\%$ and $\sigma_{R_p} = 1\%$. At $\sigma_{M_p} = 10\%$ and $\sigma_{R_p} = 2.5\%$, however, over 154 planets are needed, an order of magnitude increase.</description>

      <title>An Agnostic Biosignature Based on Modeling Panspermia and Terraformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about hierarchies of life and planetary scale replication.</description>

      <title>RG-CAT: Detection Pipeline and Catalogue of Radio Galaxies in the EMU Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present source detection and catalogue construction pipelines to build the first catalogue of radio galaxies from the 270 $\rm deg^2$ pilot survey of the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU-PS) conducted with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The detection pipeline uses Gal-DINO computer-vision networks (Gupta et al., 2024) to predict the categories of radio morphology and bounding boxes for radio sources, as well as their potential infrared host positions. The Gal-DINO network is trained and evaluated on approximately 5,000 visually inspected radio galaxies and their infrared hosts, encompassing both compact and extended radio morphologies. We find that the Intersection over Union (IoU) for the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes is larger than 0.5 for 99% of the radio sources, and 98% of predicted host positions are within $3^{\prime \prime}$ of the ground truth infrared host in the evaluation set. The catalogue construction pipeline uses the predictions of the trained network on the radio and infrared image cutouts based on the catalogue of radio components identified using the Selavy source finder algorithm. Confidence scores of the predictions are then used to prioritize Selavy components with higher scores and incorporate them first into the catalogue. This results in identifications for a total of 211,625 radio sources, with 201,211 classified as compact and unresolved. The remaining 10,414 are categorized as extended radio morphologies, including 582 FR-I, 5,602 FR-II, 1,494 FR-x (uncertain whether FR-I or FR-II), 2,375 R (single-peak resolved) radio galaxies, and 361 with peculiar and other rare morphologies. We cross-match the radio sources in the catalogue with the infrared and optical catalogues, finding infrared cross-matches for 73% and photometric redshifts for 36% of the radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from CD-EoR with REACH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization carries invaluable information about the cosmology and astrophysics of the early Universe. Analyzing the data from a sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment typically involves navigating through an intricate parameter space to accurately address various factors such as foregrounds, beam uncertainties, ionospheric distortions, and receiver noise for the search of the cosmological 21-cm signal. The traditional likelihood-based sampling methods for modeling these effects could become computationally demanding for such highly complex models, which makes it infeasible to include physically motivated 21-cm signal models in the analysis. Moreover, the inference with these traditional methods is driven by the assumed functional form of the likelihood function. This work demonstrates how Simulation-Based Inference through Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) can naturally handle these issues at a significantly reduced computational cost than the likelihood-based methods. We estimate the posterior distribution on our model parameters with TMNRE for simulated mock observations, composed of beam-weighted foregrounds, physically motivated 21-cm signal, and radiometric noise. We find that maximizing the information content by simultaneously analyzing the data from multiple time slices and antennas significantly improves the parameter constraints and leads to a better exploration of the cosmological signal. We discuss the application of TMNRE for the current configuration of the REACH experiment and demonstrate how it can be utilized to explore potential avenues for REACH. The method presented here can be easily generalized for any sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment.</description>

      <title>Log-Normal Waiting Time Widths Characterize Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astronomical phenomena, including Fast Radio Bursts and Soft Gamma Repeaters, consist of brief distinct aperiodic events. The intervals between these events vary randomly, but there are periods of greater activity, with shorter mean intervals, and of lesser activity, with longer mean intervals. A single dimensionless parameter, the width of a log-normal function fitted to the distribution of waiting times between events, quantifies the variability of the activity. This parameter describes its dynamics in analogy to the critical exponents and universality classes of renormalization group theory. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, the width of the log-normal fit is independent of the detection threshold and is a robust measure of the dynamics of the phenomenon.</description>
