      <title>Groups with pairings, Hall modules, and Hall-Littlewood polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the combinatorics of Hall-Littlewood polynomials to that of abelian $p$-groups with alternating or Hermitian perfect pairings. Our main result is an analogue of the classical relationship between the Hall algebra of abelian $p$-groups (without pairings) and Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Specifically, we define a module over the classical Hall algebra with basis indexed by groups with pairings, and explicitly relate its structure constants to Hall-Littlewood polynomials at different values of the parameter $t$.
  We also show certain expectation formulas with respect to Cohen-Lenstra type measures on groups with pairings. In the alternating case this gives a new and simpler proof of previous results of Delaunay-Jouhet.</description>

      <title>Fractional hypergraph coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate proper $(a:b)$-fractional colorings of $n$-uniform hypergraphs, which generalize traditional integer colorings of graphs. Each vertex is assigned $b$ distinct colors from a set of $a$ colors, and an edge is properly colored if no single color is shared by all vertices of the edge. A hypergraph is $(a:b)$-colorable if every edge is properly colored. We prove that for any $2\leq b\leq a-2\leq n/\ln n$, every $n$-uniform hypergraph $H$ with $ |E(H)| \leq (ab^3)^{-1/2}\left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)^{1/2} \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n-1} $ is proper $(a:b)$-colorable. We also address specific cases, including $(a:a-1)$-colorability.</description>

      <title>The Automorphism Group of the Finitary Power Monoid of the Integers under Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endowed with the binary operation of set addition carried over from the integers, the family $\mathcal P_{\mathrm{fin}}(\mathbb Z) $ of all non-empty finite subsets of $\mathbb Z$ forms a monoid whose neutral element is the singleton $\{0\}$.
  Building upon recent work by Tringali and Yan, we determine the automorphisms of $\mathcal P_{\mathrm{fin}}(\mathbb Z)$. In particular, we find that the automorphism group of $\mathcal P_{\mathrm{fin}}(\mathbb Z)$ is isomorphic to the direct product of a cyclic group of order two by the infinite dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Total positivity of Hadamard product of dual Jacobi--Trudi matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1992, Wagner proved that the Hadamard product of two totally positive lower triangular Toeplitz matrices is totally positive. In this work, we strengthen this result by establishing total monomial positivity for the Hadamard product of Jacobi--Trudi matrices. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Sokal concerning the Hadamard square of Jacobi--Trudi matrices. Moreover, we provide a manifestly positive Schur expansion for the Hadamard square of Jacobi--Trudi matrices indexed by ribbons. In addition, we construct a corresponding representation, offering a representation-theoretic proof of the Schur positivity.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy of Arithmetic Progressions in Boxes and Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combinatorial discrepancy of arithmetic progressions inside $[N] := \{1, \ldots, N\}$ is the smallest integer $D$ for which $[N]$ can be colored with two colors so that any arithmetic progression in $[N]$ contains at most $D$ more elements from one color class than the other. Bounding the discrepancy of such set systems is a classical problem in discrepancy theory. More recently, this problem was generalized to arithmetic progressions in grids like $[N]^d$ (Valk{\'o}) and $[N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ (Fox, Xu, and Zhou). In the latter setting, Fox, Xu, and Zhou gave upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy that match within a $\frac{\log |\Omega|}{\log \log |\Omega|}$ factor, where $\Omega := [N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ is the ground set. In this work, we use the connection between factorization norms and discrepancy to improve their upper bound to be within a $\sqrt{\log|\Omega|}$ factor from the lower bound. We also generalize Fox, Xu, and Zhou's lower bound, and our upper bounds to arithmetic progressions in arbitrary convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Fractional balanced chromatic number of signed subcubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A signed graph is a pair $(G,\sigma)$, where $G$ is a graph and $\sigma: E(G)\rightarrow \{-, +\}$, called signature, is an assignment of signs to the edges. Given a signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ with no negative loops, a balanced $(p,q)$-coloring of $(G,\sigma)$ is an assignment $f$ of $q$ colors to each vertex from a pool of $p$ colors such that each color class induces a balanced subgraph, i.e., no negative cycles. Let $(K_4,-)$ be the signed graph on $K_4$ with all edges being negative. In this work, we show that every signed (simple) subcubic graph admits a balanced $(5,3)$-coloring except for $(K_4,-)$ and signed graphs switching equivalent to it. For this particular signed graph the best balanced colorings are $(2p,p)$-colorings.</description>

      <title>Equitable coloring of graphs beyond planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equitable coloring of a graph is a proper coloring where the sizes of any two different color classes do not differ by more than one. A graph is IC-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that no two crossed edges have a common endpoint, and is NIC-planar graphs if it can be embedded in the plane in such a way that no two pairs of crossed edges share two endpoints. Zhang proved that every IC-planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 12$ and every NIC-planar graph with maximum degree $\Delta\geq 13$ have equitable $\Delta$-colorings. In this paper, we reduce the threshold from 12 to 10 for IC-planar graphs and from 13 to 11 for NIC-planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Counting degree-constrained orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of graph orientations under local degree constraints. Given a finite graph $G = (V, E)$ and a family of admissible sets $\{\mathsf P_v \subseteq \mathbb{Z} : v \in V\}$, let $\mathcal N (G; \prod_{v \in V} \mathsf P_v)$ denote the number of orientations in which the out-degree of each vertex $v$ lies in $P_v$. We prove a general duality formula expressing $\mathcal N(G; \prod_{v \in V} \mathsf P_v)$ as a signed sum over edge subsets, involving products of coefficient sums associated with $\{\mathsf P_v\}_{v \in V}$, from a family of polynomials. Our approach employs gauge transformations, a technique rooted in statistical physics and holographic algorithms. We also present a probabilistic derivation of the same identity, interpreting the orientation-generating polynomial as the expectation of a random polynomial product. As applications, we obtain explicit formulas for the number of even orientations and for mixed Eulerian-even orientations on general graphs. Our formula generalizes a result of Borb\'enyi and Csikv\'ari on Eulerian orientations of graphs.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal and k-hexagonal graph's normalized Laplacian spectrum and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substituting each edge of a simple connected graph $G$ by a path of length 1 and $k$ paths of length 5 generates the $k$-hexagonal graph $H^k(G)$. Iterative graph $H^k_n(G)$ is produced when the preceding constructions are repeated $n$ times. According to the graph structure, we obtain a set of linear equations, and derive the entirely normalized Laplacian spectrum of $H^k_n(G)$ when $k = 1$ and $k \geqslant 2$ respectively by analyzing the structure of the solutions of these linear equations. We find significant formulas to calculate the Kemeny's constant, multiplicative degree-Kirchhoff index and number of spanning trees of $H^k_n(G)$ as applications.</description>

      <title>Primary decomposition theorem and generalized spectral characterization of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a controllable graph of order $n$ with adjacency matrix $A$. Let $W=[e,Ae,\ldots,A^{n-1}e]$ ($e$ is the all-one vector) and $\Delta=\prod_{i&gt;j}(\alpha_i-\alpha_j)^2$ ($\alpha_i$'s are eigenvalues of $A$) be the walk matrix and the discriminant of $G$, respectively. Wang and Yu \cite{wangyu2016} showed that if
  $$\theta(G):=\gcd\{2^{-\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}\det W,\Delta\} $$
  is odd and squarefree, then $G$ is determined by its generalized spectrum (DGS). Using the primary decomposition theorem, we obtain a new criterion for a graph $G$ to be DGS without the squarefreeness assumption on $\theta(G)$. Examples are further given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion, compared with the two existing methods to deal with the difficulty of non-squarefreeness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $\Gamma$, a (bipartite)tree-line graph and a tree-graph of $\Gamma$ can be defined. With a (bipartite)tree-line graph constructed by the function $(b)\ell$, we study the continuous quantum walk on $(b)\ell ^n \Gamma$. An equitable partition of a bipartite tree-line graph is obtained by its corresponding derived tree graph. This paper also examines quantum walks on derived graphs, whose vertices represent their basis state.</description>

      <title>Global patterns in signed permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global permutation patterns have recently been shown to characterize important properties of a Coxeter group. Here we study global patterns in the context of signed permutations, with both characterizing and enumerative results. Surprisingly, many properties of signed permutations may be characterized by avoidance of the same set of patterns as the corresponding properties in the symmetric group. We also extend previous enumerative work of Egge, and our work has connections to the Garfinkle--Barbasch--Vogan correspondence, the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem, and well-known integer sequences.</description>

      <title>The $h$-vectors of toric ideals of odd cycle compositions revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph consisting of $s$ odd cycles that all share a common vertex. Bhaskara, Higashitani, and Shibu Deepthi recently computed the $h$-polynomial for the quotient ring $R/I_G$, where $I_G$ is the toric ideal of $G$, in terms of the number and sizes of odd cycles in the graph. The purpose of this note is to prove the stronger result that these toric ideals are geometrically vertex decomposable, which allows us to deduce the result of Bhaskara, Higashitani, and Shibu Deepthi about the $h$-polyhomial as a corollary.</description>

Abstract: We reduce the problem of counting self-avoiding walks in the square lattice to a problem of counting the number of integral points in multidimensional domains. We obtain an asymptotic estimate of the number of self-avoiding walks of length $n$ in the square lattice. This new formalism gives a natural and unified setting in order to study the properties the number of self-avoidings walks in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ of any dimension $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Avoidability beyond paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of avoidable paths in graphs was introduced by Beisegel, Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Servatius in 2019 as a common generalization of avoidable vertices and simplicial paths. In 2020, Bonamy, Defrain, Hatzel, and Thiebaut proved that every graph containing an induced path of order $k$ also contains an avoidable induced path of the same order. They also asked whether one could generalize this result to other avoidable structures, leaving the notion of avoidability up to interpretation. In this paper we address this question: we specify the concept of avoidability for arbitrary graphs equipped with two terminal vertices. We provide both positive and negative results, some of which appear to be related to the recent work by Chudnovsky, Norin, Seymour, and Turcotte [arXiv:2301.13175].</description>

      <title>Almost all 9-regular graphs have a modulo-5 orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12103v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1972 Tutte famously conjectured that every 4-edge-connected graph has a nowhere zero 3-flow; this is known to be equivalent to every 5-regular, 4-edge-connected graph having an edge orientation in which every in-degree is either 1 or 4. Jaeger conjectured a generalization of Tutte's conjecture, namely, that every $4p+1$-regular, $4p$-edge-connected graph has an edge orientation in which every in-degree is either $p$ or $3p+1$. Inspired by the work of Pralat and Wormald investigating $p=1$, for $p=2$ we show this holds asymptotically almost surely for random 9-regular graphs. It follows that the conjecture holds for almost all 9-regular, 8-edge-connected graphs. These results make use of the technical small subgraph conditioning method.</description>

      <title>Growing Trees and Amoebas' Replications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An amoeba is a tree together with instructions how to iteratively grow trees by adding paths of a fixed length $\ell$. This paper analyses such a growth process. An amoeba is mortal if all versions of the process are finite, and it is immortal if they are all infinite. We obtain some necessary and some sufficient conditions for mortality. In particular, for growing caterpillars in the case $\ell=1$ we characterize mortal amoebas. We discuss variations of the mortality concept, conjecture that some of them are equivalent, and support this conjecture for $\ell\in\{1,2\}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Antisymmetry of Twisted Graph Adjacency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph with a special character called the canonical character being an extremum. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Leaf-to-leaf paths of many lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every tree of maximum degree $\Delta$ with $\ell$ leaves contains paths between leaves of at least $\log_{\Delta-1}((\Delta-2)\ell)$ distinct lengths. This settles in a strong form a conjecture of Narins, Pokrovskiy and Szab\'o. We also make progress towards another conjecture of the same authors, by proving that every tree with no vertex of degree 2 and diameter at least $N$ contains $N^{2/3}/6$ distinct leaf-to-leaf path lengths between $0$ and $N$.</description>

      <title>Monomial stability of Frobenius images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study representation stability in the sense of Church, Ellenberg, and Farb \cite{FI-module} through the lens of symmetric function theory and the different symmetric function bases. We show that a sequence, $(F_n)_n$, where $F_n$ is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree $n$, has stabilizing Schur coefficients if and only if it has stabilizing monomial coefficients. More generally, we develop a framework for checking when stabilizing coefficients transfer from one symmetric function basis to another. We also see how one may compute representation stable ranges from the monomial expansions of the $F_n$.\parspace
  As applications, we reprove and refine the representation stability of diagonal coinvariant algebras, $DR_n$. We also observe new representation stability phenomena of the Garsia-Haiman modules. This establishes certain stability properties of the modified Macdonald polynomials, $\tilde{H}_{\mu[n]}[X;q,t]$, and the modified $q,t$-Kostka numbers, $\tilde{K}_{\mu[n],\nu[n]}(q,t)$. In an upcoming addition to the paper, these methods will be be applied to \textit{any} sequence $\tilde{H}_{\mu^{(n)}}[X;q,t]$ with $|\mu^{(n)}|=n$ and $\mu^{(n)}\subseteq \mu^{(n+1)}$.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Riordan Group and the Multiple Riordan Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we define Riordan type arrays and the Riordan semigroup and extend them to multiple settings. Multiple Riordan type arrays and the multiple Riordan semigroup are related to multiple Riordan arrays and the multiple Riordan group. We give a comprehensive discussion of the latter and characterize them by an $A$-sequence and multiple $Z$-sequences. Applications of Riordan type arrays in the construction of identities are given. In addition, we give compressions of multiple Riordan arrays and multiple Riordan type arrays and their sequence characterizations.</description>

      <title>The weakness of finding descending sequences in ill-founded linear orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Weihrauch degree of the problems ``find a bad sequence in a non-well quasi order'' ($\mathsf{BS}$) and ``find a descending sequence in an ill-founded linear order'' ($\mathsf{DS}$). We prove that $\mathsf{DS}$ is strictly Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{BS}$, correcting our mistaken claim in [arXiv:2010.03840]. This is done by separating their respective first-order parts. On the other hand, we show that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have the same finitary and deterministic parts, confirming that $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ have very similar uniform computational strength. We prove that K\"onig's lemma $\mathsf{KL}$ and the problem $\mathsf{wList}_{2^{\mathbb{N}},\leq\omega}$ of enumerating a given non-empty countable closed subset of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ are not Weihrauch reducible to $\mathsf{DS}$ or $\mathsf{BS}$, resolving two main open questions raised in [arXiv:2010.03840]. We also answer the question, raised in [arXiv:1804.10968], on the existence of a ``parallel quotient'' operator, and study the behavior of $\mathsf{BS}$ and $\mathsf{DS}$ under the quotient with some known problems.</description>

      <title>The homological shift algebra of a monomial ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the polynomial ring over a field $K$, and let $I\subset S$ be a monomial ideal. In this paper, we introduce the $i$th \textit{homological shift algebras} $\text{HS}_i(\mathcal{R}(I))=\bigoplus_{k\ge1}\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ of $I$. If $I$ has linear powers, these algebras have the structure of a finitely generated bigraded module over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I)$ of $I$. Hence, many invariants of $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$, such as depth, associated primes, regularity, and the $\text{v}$-number, exhibit well behaved asymptotic behavior. We determine several families of monomial ideals $I$ for which $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ has linear resolution for all $k\gg0$. Finally, we show that $\text{HS}_i(I^k)$ is Golod for all monomial ideals $I\subset S$ with linear powers and all $k\gg0$.</description>

      <title>Edge ideals and their asymptotic syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite simple graph, and let $I(G)$ denote its edge ideal. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the syzygies of powers of edge ideals through the lens of homological shift ideals $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$. We introduce the notion of the $i$th homological strong persistence property for monomial ideals $I$, providing an algebraic characterization that ensures the chain of inclusions $\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^2)\subseteq\text{Ass}\,\text{HS}_i(I^3) \subseteq\cdots$. We prove that edge ideals possess both the $0$th and $1$st homological strong persistence properties. To this end, we explicitly describe the first homological shift algebra of $I(G)$ and show that $\text{HS}_1(I(G)^{k+1}) = I(G) \cdot \text{HS}_1(I(G)^k)$ for all $k \ge 1$. Finally, we conjecture that if $I(G)$ has a linear resolution, then $\text{HS}_i(I(G)^k)$ also has a linear resolution for all $k \gg 0$, and we present partial results supporting this conjecture.</description>
