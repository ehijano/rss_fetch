      <title>MusiCRS: Benchmarking Audio-Centric Conversational Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommendation has advanced rapidly with large language models (LLMs), yet music remains a uniquely challenging domain where effective recommendations require reasoning over audio content beyond what text or metadata can capture. We present MusiCRS, the first benchmark for audio-centric conversational recommendation that links authentic user conversations from Reddit with corresponding audio tracks. MusiCRS contains 477 high-quality conversations spanning diverse genres (classical, hip-hop, electronic, metal, pop, indie, jazz) with 3,589 unique musical entities and audio grounding via YouTube links. MusiCRS enables evaluation across three input modality configurations: audio-only, query-only, and audio+query (multimodal), allowing systematic comparison of audio-LLMs, retrieval models, and traditional approaches. Our experiments reveal that current systems rely heavily on textual signals and struggle with nuanced audio reasoning. This exposes fundamental limitations in cross-modal knowledge integration where models excel at dialogue semantics but cannot effectively ground abstract musical concepts in actual audio content. To facilitate progress, we release the MusiCRS dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/rohan2810/MusiCRS), evaluation code (https://github.com/rohan2810/musiCRS), and comprehensive baselines.</description>

      <title>ArtiFree: Detecting and Reducing Generative Artifacts in Diffusion-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) achieves natural-sounding speech and strong generalization, yet suffers from key limitations like generative artifacts and high inference latency. In this work, we systematically study artifact prediction and reduction in diffusion-based SE. We show that variance in speech embeddings can be used to predict phonetic errors during inference. Building on these findings, we propose an ensemble inference method guided by semantic consistency across multiple diffusion runs. This technique reduces WER by 15% in low-SNR conditions, effectively improving phonetic accuracy and semantic plausibility. Finally, we analyze the effect of the number of diffusion steps, showing that adaptive diffusion steps balance artifact suppression and latency. Our findings highlight semantic priors as a powerful tool to guide generative SE toward artifact-free outputs.</description>

      <title>Thinking While Listening: Simple Test Time Scaling For Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework that enables neural models to "think while listening" to everyday sounds, thereby enhancing audio classification performance. Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.</description>

      <title>Can Audio Large Language Models Verify Speaker Identity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates adapting Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) for speaker verification (SV). We reformulate SV as an audio question-answering task and conduct comprehensive zero-shot evaluations on public benchmarks, showing that current ALLMs have limited zero-shot SV capability and often struggle in diverse acoustic conditions. To address this challenge, we perform supervised fine-tuning on speaker verification data. A rule-based hard pair sampling strategy is proposed to construct more challenging training pairs. Lightweight fine-tuning substantially improves the performance, though there is still a gap between ALLMs and conventional models. Then, we extend to text-dependent SV by jointly querying ALLMs to verify speaker identity and spoken content, yielding results competitive with cascaded ASR-SV systems. Our findings demonstrate that with proper adaptation, ALLMs hold substantial potential as a unified model for robust speaker verification systems, while maintaining the general audio understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Speech Watermarking for Speech Synthesis via Progressive Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of speech generative models, unauthorized voice cloning poses significant privacy and security risks. Speech watermarking offers a viable solution for tracing sources and preventing misuse. Current watermarking technologies fall mainly into two categories: DSP-based methods and deep learning-based methods. DSP-based methods are efficient but vulnerable to attacks, whereas deep learning-based methods offer robust protection at the expense of significantly higher computational cost. To improve the computational efficiency and enhance the robustness, we propose PKDMark, a lightweight deep learning-based speech watermarking method that leverages progressive knowledge distillation (PKD). Our approach proceeds in two stages: (1) training a high-performance teacher model using an invertible neural network-based architecture, and (2) transferring the teacher's capabilities to a compact student model through progressive knowledge distillation. This process reduces computational costs by 93.6% while maintaining high level of robust performance and imperceptibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our distilled model achieves an average detection F1 score of 99.6% with a PESQ of 4.30 in advanced distortions, enabling efficient speech watermarking for real-time speech synthesis applications.</description>

      <title>Eliminating stability hallucinations in llm-based tts models via attention guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on resolving stability hallucinations (e.g., repetitive or omitted speech) in LLM-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) models by improving and leveraging the attention mechanism. First, we analyzed the alignment mechanism between text tokens and speech tokens in LLMs. We then proposed a metric termed the Optimal Alignment Score (OAS), which employs the Viterbi algorithm to evaluate text-speech alignment quality. Subsequently, OAS was integrated into the training of CosyVoice2 to assist LLMs in learning continuous, stable alignment. Additionally, the pre-trained attention value is employed to guide the training of the student CosyVoice2 via chain-of-thought (CoT), which further reduces stability hallucinations in synthesized speech. Experiments on the Seed-TTS-Eval and CV3-Eval test sets demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively reduce the stability hallucinations of CosyVoice2 without introducing additional negative effects.

      <title>SEA-Spoof: Bridging The Gap in Multilingual Audio Deepfake Detection for South-East Asian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19865v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the digital economy in South-East Asia (SEA) has amplified the risks of audio deepfakes, yet current datasets cover SEA languages only sparsely, leaving models poorly equipped to handle this critical region. This omission is critical: detection models trained on high-resource languages collapse when applied to SEA, due to mismatches in synthesis quality, language-specific characteristics, and data scarcity. To close this gap, we present SEA-Spoof, the first large-scale Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) dataset especially for SEA languages. SEA-Spoof spans 300+ hours of paired real and spoof speech across Tamil, Hindi, Thai, Indonesian, Malay, and Vietnamese. Spoof samples are generated from a diverse mix of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial systems, capturing wide variability in style and fidelity. Benchmarking state-of-the-art detection models reveals severe cross-lingual degradation, but fine-tuning on SEA-Spoof dramatically restores performance across languages and synthesis sources. These results highlight the urgent need for SEA-focused research and establish SEA-Spoof as a foundation for developing robust, cross-lingual, and fraud-resilient detection systems.</description>

      <title>CoMelSinger: Discrete Token-Based Zero-Shot Singing Synthesis With Structured Melody Control and Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive vocal performances from structured musical inputs such as lyrics and pitch sequences. While recent progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt, compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture, CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens, preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Enabling Multi-Species Bird Classification on Low-Power Bioacoustic Loggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces WrenNet, an efficient neural network enabling real-time multi-species bird audio classification on low-power microcontrollers for scalable biodiversity monitoring. We propose a semi-learnable spectral feature extractor that adapts to avian vocalizations, outperforming standard mel-scale and fully-learnable alternatives. On an expert-curated 70-species dataset, WrenNet achieves up to 90.8\% accuracy on acoustically distinctive species and 70.1\% on the full task. When deployed on an AudioMoth device ($\leq$1MB RAM), it consumes only 77mJ per inference. Moreover, the proposed model is over 16x more energy-efficient compared to Birdnet when running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. This work demonstrates the first practical framework for continuous, multi-species acoustic monitoring on low-power edge devices.</description>

      <title>Frame-Stacked Local Transformers For Efficient Multi-Codebook Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech generation models based on large language models (LLMs) typically operate on discrete acoustic codes, which differ fundamentally from text tokens due to their multicodebook structure. At each timestep, models must predict N codebook entries jointly, introducing dependencies that challenge simple parallel prediction approaches. Parallel prediction assumes independence among codebooks, yielding efficient decoding but often at the cost of reduced fidelity. To address this, hierarchical strategies employ a local transformer (LT) to refine predictions and capture intra-timestep dependencies. In this work, we systematically investigate two LT architectures: an autoregressive transformer that generates codebooks sequentially, and a MaskGIT-based transformer that performs iterative masked prediction. Both designs further enable frame stacking, where the primary transformer predicts multiple frames jointly, and the LT decodes their codebooks, offering improvements in speed without compromising perceptual quality. Through extensive analysis, we characterize the tradeoffs between parallel and iterative sampling strategies across different throughput and quality regimes. Finally, we propose practical guidelines for selecting decoding strategies based on deployment priorities such as computational efficiency and synthesis fidelity.</description>

      <title>Selective Classifier-free Guidance for Zero-shot Text-to-speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In zero-shot text-to-speech, achieving a balance between fidelity to the target speaker and adherence to text content remains a challenge. While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.</description>

      <title>Non-locally averaged pruned reassigned spectrograms: a tool for glottal pulse visualization and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reassigned spectrograms have shown advantages in precise formant measuring and inter-speaker differentiation. However, reassigned spectrograms suffer from their inability to visualize larger amounts of data in an easily comprehensible and reproducible manner. Utilizing the techniques and tools developed by Fulop and Fitz, a variation of the reassigned spectrogram is proposed. Non-locally Averaged Pruned Reassigned Spectrograms (NAPReS) provide a simplified view into the characteristics of a speaker's glottal pulsation patterns throughout the centroid of a vowel through the stacking, summing, and pruning of large numbers of glottal pulses. In this exploratory study, NAPReS has been shown to display a large amount of data in an easily comprehensible and quantifiable manner, while also making the observation of low-amplitude cyclical structures more accessible. NAPReS also allows for alternative formant fitting methods such as Gaussian mixture modeling. In this study, NAPReS with GMM was compared against conventional LPC fitting of formant values and was shown to be more reproducible than conventional LPC fitting in high-noise situations.</description>

      <title>PART: Progressive Alignment Representation Training for Multilingual Speech-To-Text with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have expanded from text to speech, giving rise to Speech Large Models (SLMs) that support recognition, translation, and synthesis. A key challenge is aligning speech and text representations, which becomes harder in multilingual settings. Existing methods often freeze LLM parameters and train encoders on multilingual data, but this forces cross-language convergence and limits performance. We introduce Progressive Alignment Representation Training (PART), a multi-stage and multi-task framework that separates within-language from cross-language alignment. During cross-language training, LLM parameters are dynamically activated, and text-based tasks are later introduced to enhance multilingual understanding. Experiments on CommonVoice 15, Fleurs, Wenetspeech, and CoVoST2 show that PART surpasses conventional approaches, with analysis confirming its ability to balance language-specific distinctions and cross-language generalization. These results demonstrate PART's effectiveness and generality for multilingual speech modality alignment.</description>

      <title>MAGE: A Coarse-to-Fine Speech Enhancer with Masked Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19881v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and perceptual quality. In this paper, we introduce MAGE, a Masked Audio Generative Enhancer that advances generative speech enhancement through a compact and robust design. Unlike prior masked generative models with random masking, MAGE employs a scarcity-aware coarse-to-fine masking strategy that prioritizes frequent tokens in early steps and rare tokens in later refinements, improving efficiency and generalization. We also propose a lightweight corrector module that further stabilizes inference by detecting low-confidence predictions and re-masking them for refinement. Built on BigCodec and finetuned from Qwen2.5-0.5B, MAGE is reduced to 200M parameters through selective layer retention. Experiments on DNS Challenge and noisy LibriSpeech show that MAGE achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and significantly reduces word error rate for downstream recognition, outperforming larger baselines. Audio examples are available at https://hieugiaosu.github.io/MAGE/.</description>

      <title>MultiSoundGen: Video-to-Audio Generation for Multi-Event Scenarios via SlowFast Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining and Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event scenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or transitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face challenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with rapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining (AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture. SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality. Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. The complete code and dataset will be released soon.</description>

      <title>InconVAD: A Two-Stage Dual-Tower Framework for Multimodal Emotion Inconsistency Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting emotional inconsistency across modalities is a key challenge in affective computing, as speech and text often convey conflicting cues. Existing approaches generally rely on incomplete emotion representations and employ unconditional fusion, which weakens performance when modalities are inconsistent. Moreover, little prior work explicitly addresses inconsistency detection itself. We propose InconVAD, a two-stage framework grounded in the Valence/Arousal/Dominance (VAD) space. In the first stage, independent uncertainty-aware models yield robust unimodal predictions. In the second stage, a classifier identifies cross-modal inconsistency and selectively integrates consistent signals. Extensive experiments show that InconVAD surpasses existing methods in both multimodal emotion inconsistency detection and modeling, offering a more reliable and interpretable solution for emotion analysis.</description>

      <title>Unifying Symbolic Music Arrangement: Track-Aware Reconstruction and Structured Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for automatic multitrack music arrangement that enables a single pre-trained symbolic music model to handle diverse arrangement scenarios, including reinterpretation, simplification, and additive generation. At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</description>

      <title>Stylus: Repurposing Stable Diffusion for Training-Free Music Style Transfer on Mel-Spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Music style transfer enables personalized music creation by blending the structure of a source with the stylistic attributes of a reference. Existing text-conditioned and diffusion-based approaches show promise but often require paired datasets, extensive training, or detailed annotations. We present Stylus, a training-free framework that repurposes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for music style transfer in the mel-spectrogram domain. Stylus manipulates self-attention by injecting style key-value features while preserving source queries to maintain musical structure. To improve fidelity, we introduce a phase-preserving reconstruction strategy that avoids artifacts from Griffin-Lim reconstruction, and we adopt classifier-free-guidance-inspired control for adjustable stylization and multi-style blending. In extensive evaluations, Stylus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 34.1% higher content preservation and 25.7% better perceptual quality without any additional training.</description>

      <title>ctPuLSE: Close-Talk, and Pseudo-Label Based Far-Field, Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is via purely-supervised deep learning on simulated pairs of far-field noisy-reverberant speech (i.e., mixtures) and clean speech. The trained models, however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded mixtures. To deal with this, this paper investigates training enhancement models directly on real mixtures. However, a major difficulty challenging this approach is that, since the clean speech of real mixtures is unavailable, there lacks a good supervision for real mixtures. In this context, assuming that a training set consisting of real-recorded pairs of close-talk and far-field mixtures is available, we propose to address this difficulty via close-talk speech enhancement, where an enhancement model is first trained on simulated mixtures to enhance real-recorded close-talk mixtures and the estimated close-talk speech can then be utilized as a supervision (i.e., pseudo-label) for training far-field speech enhancement models directly on the paired real-recorded far-field mixtures. We name the proposed system ctPuLSE. Evaluation results on the popular CHiME-4 dataset show that ctPuLSE can derive high-quality pseudo-labels and yield far-field speech enhancement models with strong generalizability to real data.</description>

      <title>A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Embedding Alignment in Code Generation for Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.</description>

      <title>EAI-Avatar: Emotion-Aware Interactive Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Robust Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction with Emotion-Aware Multiple Enrollment Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) is a critical challenge in cocktail party scenarios. While leveraging multiple modalities, such as voice, lip, face, and expression embeddings, can enhance performance, real-world applications often suffer from intermittent modality dropout. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the interactions and robustness of various multimodal fusion strategies under varying degrees of modality dropout. We build upon a state-of-the-art audio-visual speech enhancement system and integrate four distinct speaker identity cues: lip embeddings for synchronized contextual information, a voice speaker embedding extracted via cross-attention for acoustic consistency, a static face embedding for speaker identity, and a novel dynamic expression embedding for frame-wise emotional features. We systematically evaluate different combinations of these modalities under two key training regimes: zero dropout and 80% modality dropout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while a full multimodal ensemble achieves optimal performance under ideal (zero dropout) conditions, its effectiveness diminishes significantly when test-time dropout occurs without prior exposure during training. Crucially, we show that training with a high (80%) modality dropout rate dramatically enhances model robustness, enabling the system to maintain superior performance even under severe test-time missing modalities. Our findings highlight that voice embeddings exhibit consistent robustness, while the proposed expression embedding provides valuable complementary information. This work underscores the importance of training strategies that account for real-world imperfection, moving beyond pure performance maximization to achieve practical reliability in multimodal speech enhancement systems.</description>
