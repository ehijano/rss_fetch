      <title>Rosette formations as symmetry-breaking events: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.</description>

      <title>Revisiting convolutive blind source separation for identifying spiking motor neuron activity: From theory to practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Identifying the activity of motor neurons (MNs) non-invasively is possible by decomposing signals from muscles, e.g., surface electromyography (EMG) or ultrasound. The theoretical background of MN identification is convolutive blind source separation (cBSS), and different algorithms have been developed and validated. Yet, the existence and identifiability of inverse solutions and the corresponding estimation errors are not fully understood. Further, the guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters are often built on empirical observations, limiting the translation to clinical applications and other modalities. Approach: We revisited the cBSS model for MN identification, augmented it with new theoretical insights and derived a framework that can predict the existence of inverse solutions. This framework allows the quantification of estimation errors due to the imperfect inversion of the motor unit action potentials (MUAP), noise sources, and the ill-conditioning of the inverse problem. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we used computer simulations. Main results: (1) Increasing the similarity of MUAPs or correlation between spike trains increases the bias for detecting high amplitude MUs. (2) The optimal objective function depends on the expected spike amplitude, spike amplitude statistics and the amplitude of background spikes. (3) There is some wiggle room for MN detection given non-stationary MUAPs. (4) There is no connection between MUAP duration and extension factor, in contrast to previous guidelines. (5) Source quality metrics like the silhouette score (SIL) or the pulse-to-noise ratio (PNR) are highly correlated with a source's objective function output. (6) SIL is superior to PNR. Significance: These findings will guide cBSS algorithm developments tailored to MN identification and clinical application translation.</description>
