      <title>A multi particle toy system with analytic solutions to investigate composite bosons in a harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a three dimensional toy systems with two types of fermions forming a composite boson. They are hold in a harmonic potential. The basis functions are constructed from an internal and an external Gauss function. All integrals have analytical solutions. The high symmetry reduces the number of integrals to be calculated for the symmetrized wave functions. With the internal Gauss function the composite bosons can be tuned from fermionic unbound behavior to bosonic bound behavior.</description>

      <title>Classical Commitments to Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a classical commitment scheme to quantum states, which allows a quantum prover to compute a classical commitment to a quantum state, and later open each qubit of the state in either the standard or the Hadamard basis. Our notion is a strengthening of the measurement protocol from Mahadev (STOC 2018). We construct such a commitment scheme from the post-quantum Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption, and more generally from any noisy trapdoor claw-free function family that has the distributional strong adaptive hardcore bit property (a property that we define in this work).
  Our scheme is succinct in the sense that the running time of the verifier in the commitment phase depends only on the security parameter (independent of the size of the committed state), and its running time in the opening phase grows only with the number of qubits that are being opened (and the security parameter). As a corollary we obtain a classical succinct argument system for QMA under the post-quantum LWE assumption. Previously, this was only known assuming post-quantum secure indistinguishability obfuscation. As an additional corollary we obtain a generic way of converting any X/Z quantum PCP into a succinct argument system under the quantum hardness of LWE.</description>

      <title>Conditional disclosure of secrets with quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. We begin by looking for quantum analogues of results already established in the classical CDS literature. Doing so we establish a number of basic properties of CDQS, including lower bounds on entanglement and communication stated in terms of measures of communication complexity. Because of the close relationship to the $f$-routing position-verification scheme, our results have relevance to the security of these schemes.</description>

      <title>On verifiable quantum advantage with peaked circuit sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a decade after its proposal, the idea of using quantum computers to sample hard distributions has remained a key path to demonstrating quantum advantage. Yet a severe drawback remains: verification seems to require exponential classical computation. As an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new candidate for quantum advantage experiments with otherwise-random ''peaked circuits'', i.e., quantum circuits whose outputs have high concentrations on a computational basis state. Naturally, the heavy output string can be used for classical verification.
  In this work, we analytically and numerically study an explicit model of peaked circuits, in which $\tau_r$ layers of uniformly random gates are augmented by $\tau_p$ layers of gates that are optimized to maximize peakedness. We show that getting constant peakedness from such circuits requires $\tau_{p} = \Omega((\tau_r/n)^{0.19})$ with overwhelming probability. However, we also give numerical evidence that nontrivial peakedness is possible in this model -- decaying exponentially with the number of qubits, but more than can be explained by any approximation where the output of a random quantum circuit is treated as a Haar-random state. This suggests that these peaked circuits have the potential for future verifiable quantum advantage experiments.
  Our work raises numerous open questions about random peaked circuits, including how to generate them efficiently, and whether they can be distinguished from fully random circuits in classical polynomial time.</description>

      <title>QuantumAnnealing: A Julia Package for Simulating Dynamics of Transverse Field Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog Quantum Computers are promising tools for improving performance on applications such as modeling behavior of quantum materials, providing fast heuristic solutions to optimization problems, and simulating quantum systems. Due to the challenges of simulating dynamic quantum systems, there are relatively few classical tools for modeling the behavior of these devices and verifying their performance. QuantumAnnealing.jl provides a toolkit for performing simulations of Analog Quantum Computers on classical hardware. This package includes functionality for simulation of the time evolution of the Transverse Field Ising Model, replicating annealing schedules used by real world annealing hardware, implementing custom annealing schedules, and more. This allows for rapid prototyping of models expected to display interesting behavior, verification of the performance of quantum devices, and easy comparison against the expected behavior of quantum devices against classical approaches for small systems. The software is provided as open-source and is available through Julia's package registry system.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Gradient Calculations for Ice VIII and IX using Polarizable Embedding: A Comparative Study on Classical Computers and Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the performance of the Polarizable Embedding Variational Quantum Eigensolver Self-Consistent-Field (PE-VQE-SCF) model for computing electric field gradients with comparisons to conventional complete active space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) calculations and experimental results. We compute quadrupole coupling constants for ice VIII and ice IX. We find that the inclusion of the environment is crucial for obtaining results that match the experimental data. The calculations for ice VIII are within the experimental uncertainty for both CASSCF and VQE-SCF for oxygen and lie close to the experimental value for ice IX as well. With the VQE-SCF, which is based on an Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored (ADAPT) ansatz, we find that the inclusion of the environment and the size of the different basis sets do not directly affect the gate counts. However, by including an explicit environment, the wavefunction and, therefore, the optimization problem becomes more complicated, which usually results in the need to include more operators from the operator pool, thereby increasing the depth of the circuit.</description>

      <title>Designing open quantum systems with known steady states: Davies generators and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for constructing generic models of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with a target stationary (mixed) state. Our framework identifies (almost) all combinations of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics that relax to a steady state of interest, generalizing the Davies' generator for dissipative relaxation at finite temperature to nonequilibrium dynamics targeting arbitrary stationary states. We focus on Gibbs states of stabilizer Hamiltonians, identifying local Lindbladians compatible therewith by constraining the rates of dissipative and unitary processes. Moreover, given terms in the Lindbladian not compatible with the target state, our formalism identifies the operations -- including syndrome measurements and local feedback -- one must apply to correct these errors. Our methods also reveal new models of quantum dynamics: for example, we provide a "measurement-induced phase transition" where measurable two-point functions exhibit critical (power-law) scaling with distance at a critical ratio of the transverse field and rate of measurement and feedback. Time-reversal symmetry -- defined naturally within our formalism -- can be broken both in effectively classical, and intrinsically quantum, ways. Our framework provides a systematic starting point for exploring the landscape of quantum dynamical universality classes, as well as identifying new protocols for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Approximating Korobov Functions via Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to address challenging problems in scientific computation. Therefore, it is important to analyze the capability of quantum circuits in solving computational problems from the perspective of approximation theory. In this paper, we explicitly construct quantum circuits that can approximate $d$-dimensional functions in the Korobov function space, $X^{2, p}([0,1]^d)$. We achieve this goal by leveraging the quantum signal processing algorithm and the linear combinations of unitaries technique to construct quantum circuits that implement Chebyshev polynomials which can approximate functions in $X^{2, p}([0,1]^d)$. Our work provides quantitative approximation bounds and estimates the complexity of implementing the proposed quantum circuits. Since $X^{2, p}(\Omega)$ is a subspace of Sobolev spaces, $W^{k,p}([0,1]^d)$, for $\max_{1 \leq i \leq d} k_i = 2$, our works develops a theoretical foundation to implement a large class of functions on a quantum computer. Our research adds to discussions about merging quantum computing techniques with scientific computing, suggesting promising paths for using quantum algorithms to solve challenging computational problems more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Fermionic tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how fermionic statistics can be naturally incorporated in tensor networks on arbitrary graphs through the use of graded Hilbert spaces. This formalism allows to use tensor network methods for fermionic lattice systems in a local way, avoiding the need of a Jordan-Wigner transformation or the explicit tracking of leg crossings by swap gates in 2D tensor networks. The graded Hilbert spaces can be readily integrated with other internal and lattice symmetries in tensor networks, and only require minor extensions to an existing tensor network software package. We review and benchmark the fermionic versions of common algorithms for matrix product states and projected entangled-pair states.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational advantage with constant-temperature Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system coupled to a bath at some fixed, finite temperature converges to its Gibbs state. This thermalization process defines a natural, physically-motivated model of quantum computation. However, whether quantum computational advantage can be achieved within this realistic physical setup has remained open, due to the challenge of finding systems that thermalize quickly, but are classically intractable. Here we consider sampling from the measurement outcome distribution of quantum Gibbs states at constant temperatures, and prove that this task demonstrates quantum computational advantage. We design a family of commuting almost-local Hamiltonians (parent Hamiltonians of shallow quantum circuits) and prove that they rapidly converge to their Gibbs states under the standard physical model of thermalization (as a continuous-time quantum Markov chain). On the other hand, we show that no polynomial time classical algorithm can sample from the measurement outcome distribution by reducing to the classical hardness of sampling from noiseless shallow quantum circuits. The key step in the reduction is constructing a fault-tolerance scheme for shallow IQP circuits against input noise.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Two-Photon Quantum Controlled Phase-Flip Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems have been used to reveal interesting fundamental physics and to improve information capacity and noise resilience in quantum information processing. However, it remains a significant challenge to realize universal two-photon quantum gates in high dimensions with high success probability. Here, by considering an ion-cavity QED system, we theoretically propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first high-dimensional, deterministic and universal two-photon quantum gate. By using an optical cavity embedded with a single trapped 40Ca+ ion, we achieve a high average fidelity larger than 98% for a quantum controlled phase-flip gate in four-dimensional space, spanned by photonic spin angular momenta and orbital angular momenta. Our proposed system can be an essential building block for high-dimensional quantum information processing, and also provides a platform for studying high-dimensional cavity QED.</description>

      <title>Scalable cyclic transformation of orbital angular momentum modes based on a nonreciprocal Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons provides a pivotal resource for carrying out high-dimensional classical and quantum information processing due to its unique discrete high-dimensional nature. The cyclic transformation of a set of orthogonal OAM modes is an essential building block for universal high-dimensional information processing. Its realization in the quantum domain is the universal quantum Pauli-X gate. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a cyclic transformation of six OAM modes with an averaged efficiency higher than 96% by exploiting a nonreciprocal Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our system is simple and can, in principle, be scaled to more modes. By improving phase stabilization and inputting quantum photonic states, this method can perform universal single-photon quantum Pauli-X gate, thus paving the way for scalable high-dimensional quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Pure skin effect obeying power partition in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has received great attention recently. In particular, band structures in non-Hermitian systems can be engineered to exhibit various topological effects. Among them, one of the most intriguing phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Here, we investigate NHSE in systems featuring directed chains or directed graphs, where the arrows denote the directions of the non-reciprocal hopping between neighbouring nodes. We show that the systems exhibit pure skin modes with non-oscillatory wavefunctions, in contrast to previously studied NHSE. Interestingly, the sum of the decay constants along different directions for each skin mode obeys a power partition rule, i.e. their sum is a fixed value and the value of each constant only depends on the ratio between the non-reciprocal hopping parameters and is independent of detailed graph configurations. Such Pure Skin Effect (PSE) can be explained by using a generalized method for solving the Generalized Brillouin-zone with multiple bulk states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the performance of quantum key distribution is crucial, driving the exploration of various key distillation techniques to increase the key rate and tolerable error rate. It is imperative to develop a comprehensive framework to encapsulate and enhance the existing methods. In this work, we propose an advantage distillation framework for quantum key distribution. Building on the entanglement distillation protocol, our framework integrates all the existing key distillation methods and offers better generalization and performance. Using classical linear codes, our framework can achieve higher key rates, particularly without one-time pad encryption for postprocessing. Our approach provides insights into existing protocols and offers a systematic way for future enhancements of quantum key distribution protocols.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article utilizes the inspiration to apply the Wyel operators for producing the Kraus operators, which are crucial in the discrete-time open quantum walk. It assists us in extending the idea of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs. We make the new model of quantum walk useful to build up a quantum PageRank algorithm. In classical computation, Google's PageRank is a significant algorithm for arranging web pages on the World Wide Web. In general, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also represents the importance of the vertices of a network. We can compute the new quantum PageRank algorithm in polynomial time using a classical computer. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erdos-Renyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, random-k-out graph, binary tree graph, GNC network, Barabasi and Albert network, etc.</description>

      <title>Dynamic transition of the density-matrix topology under parity-time symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density-matrix topology, defined through the geometric property of the relevant modular Hamiltonian, can undergo transitions in the corresponding open-system dynamics. While symmetry considerations are crucial to ensure such a dynamic topological transition, we show that a hidden parity-time symmetry can further facilitate it. Considering the Lindbladian dynamics of a fermionic Gaussian state, we extract the time-evolved density-matrix topology from the single-particle correlation, whose dynamics is governed by a non-Hermitian damping matrix. We show that, for a parity-time symmetric damping matrix and a chiral symmetric correlation matrix, a dynamic transition in the density-matrix topology necessarily occurs in the parity-time unbroken regime where eigenvalues of the damping matrix are real. We illustrate our results using a concrete model, and map out the dynamic phase diagram.Remarkably, we find that the dynamic transition can also happen periodically in the parity-time symmetry broken regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and quartic interactions which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k = 8.7 \ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms per $N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{5}$ two-qubit or Clifford+$T$-gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of energy extraction gain from non-classical correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of microscopic thermodynamics, correlations can play a crucial role for energy extraction. Our work sheds light on this connection by demonstrating that entanglement governs the amount of extractable energy in a controllable setting. We experimentally investigate a fundamental link between information, encoded in tunable non-classical correlations and quantified by quantum state tomography, and its utility as fuel for energy extraction. We realize an agent-demon protocol involving two trapped-ion qubits, and show that by implementing an appropriate feedback policy, the demon can optimize the energy extraction process, capitalizing on the correlations between the system's constituents. By quantifying both the concurrence of the two-qubit resource state and the energy extraction gain from applying the feedback policy, we corroborate the connection between information and energy, solidifying the role of non-classical correlations as a resource for thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Floquet dynamics of Rabi model beyond the counterrotating hybridized rotating wave method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monochromatically driven two-level systems (i.e., Rabi models) are ubiquitous in various fields of physics. Though they have been exactly solved, the physical pictures in these exact solutions are not clear. Recently, approximate analytical solutions with neat physics have been obtained by using the counterrotating hybridized rotating wave (CHRW) method, which has been proven to be effective over a wider range of parameters than the previous analytical solutions. However, the CHRW depends on a parameter {\xi}, which has no solution in some regimes. Here we combine the double-unitary-transformation approach with the generalized Van Vleck nearly degenerate perturbation theory, and present approximate analytical results with clear physics for almost all parameter regimes, which agree well with the numerical solutions and the previous experimental results. Moreover, the dynamic frequencies of the Rabi model are regular, and the frequency with the highest Fourier amplitude changes from the Rabi frequency to 2n{\omega} with driving frequency {\omega} and integer n, as the driving intensity increases from weak to deep-strong. In addition, we further explore the Floquet dynamics of the dissipative open Rabi model. Remarkably, the dissipations are tunable in the rotating frame, and the approximate analytical results obtained by our method are in good agreement with the numerical results in the strong driving regime. These results pave the way to quantum control using strong and deep-strong driving with applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A resource-efficient variational quantum algorithm for mRNA codon optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the mRNA codon has an essential impact on gene expression for a specific target protein. It is an NP-hard problem; thus, exact solutions to such optimization problems become computationally intractable for realistic problem sizes on both classical and quantum computers. However, approximate solutions via heuristics can substantially impact the application they enable. Quantum approximate optimization is an alternative computation paradigm promising for tackling such problems. Recently, there has been some research in quantum algorithms for bioinformatics, specifically for mRNA codon optimization. This research presents a denser way to encode codons for implementing mRNA codon optimization via the variational quantum eigensolver algorithms on a gate-based quantum computer. This reduces the qubit requirement by half compared to the existing quantum approach, thus allowing longer sequences to be executed on existing quantum processors. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by comparing its results to exact solutions, showing well-matching results.</description>

      <title>Unitary Synthesis of Clifford+T Circuits with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for synthesizing unitaries into quantum circuits. Unitary synthesis aims to identify a quantum circuit that represents a given unitary while minimizing circuit depth, total gate count, a specific gate count, or a combination of these factors. While past research has focused predominantly on continuous gate sets, synthesizing unitaries from the parameter-free Clifford+T gate set remains a challenge. Although the time complexity of this task will inevitably remain exponential in the number of qubits for general unitaries, reducing the runtime for simple problem instances still poses a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the tree-search method Gumbel AlphaZero to solve the problem for a subset of exactly synthesizable Clifford+T unitaries. Our approach can synthesize unitaries for up to five qubits generated from the set of randomized quantum circuits with up to 60 gates. Furthermore, our inference times are around 30 seconds on a single GPU on average, surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms QuantumCircuitOpt and MIN-T-SYNTH for higher qubit numbers. Our work provides a competitive baseline for synthesis algorithms to be developed in the upcoming years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $1/2$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space $CP^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin j (a 2j+1 -state system) for generic j is represented instead by a point of a larger space, $CP^{2j}$. Here we study the angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The state, $(J \cdot n) | j, n\rangle = j |j, n \rangle $, where $J$ is the angular momentum operator and $n$ stands for a generic unit vector in $R^3$, is found to behave as a classical angular momentum, $ j n $. We discuss this phenomenon, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. This problem arose from the consideration of a macroscopic body under an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our observations help to explain how classical mechanics (with unique particle trajectories) emerges naturally from quantum mechanics in this context, and at the same time, make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, a more precise one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems are a cornerstone of modern physics, being responsible for groundbreaking phenomena from superconducting magnets to quantum computing. In most cases, correlations in electrons arise exclusively due to Coulomb interactions. In this work, we reveal that free electrons interacting simultaneously with a light field can become highly correlated via mechanisms beyond Coulomb interactions. In the case of two electrons, the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for the joint probability distribution of the output electron energies is enhanced over 13 orders of magnitude compared to that of electrons interacting with the light field in succession (one after another). These highly correlated electrons are the result of momentum and energy exchange between the participating electrons via the external quantum light field. Our findings pave the way to the creation and control of highly correlated free electrons for applications including quantum information and ultra-fast imaging.</description>

      <title>Stark localization near Aubry-Andr\'{e} criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the Stark localization near the Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) critical point. We study system-dependent parameters, such as localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited state, for characterizing the localization-delocalization transition. We show that the scaling exponents possessed by these key descriptors of localization are quite different from that of a pure AA model or Stark model. Near the critical point of the AA model, inducing Stark field of strength $h$, the localization length $\zeta$ scales as $\zeta\propto h^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.29$ which is different than both the pure AA model ($\nu=1$) and Stark model ($\nu\approx0.33$). The IPR scales as IPR $\propto h^{s}$ with $s\approx0.096$ which is again significantly different than both the pure AA model ($s\approx0.33$) and Stark model ($s\approx0.33$). The energy gap, $\Delta$, scales as $E\propto h^{\nu z}$, where $z\approx2.37$ which is however same as the pure AA model.</description>

      <title>Approaches of frequency-dependent squeezing for the low frequency detector of Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum noise in gravitational-wave detectors can be suppressed in a broadband by frequency-dependent squeezing. It usually requires one large scale filter cavity and even two, for example in the low frequency detector of Einstein Telescope, which is a detuned dual recycling Fabry-Perot Michelson interferometer. In this paper, we study the feasibility of replacing two filter cavities with a coupled-cavity, aiming to reduce the optical losses with less number of optics. It turns out this approach is only theoretically valid, however, the required parameters of the optics don't support practical implementation, which is consistent with the results in [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 101}, 082002 (2020)]. Furthermore, we investigate the viability of utilizing EPR squeezing to eliminate either one or two filter cavities in Einstein Telescope. It turns out EPR squeezing would allow to eliminate one filter cavity, and can potentially improve the detector sensitivity with the allowance of higher input squeezing level, benefiting from the longer length of the arm cavity which serves as one of the filter cavities for frequency-dependent squeezing.</description>

      <title>Quantifying multipartite quantum states by ($k+1$)-partite entanglement measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how to quantify the quantum states of $n$-particles from the point of $(k+1)$-partite entanglement $(1\leq k\leq n-1)$, which plays an instrumental role in quantum nonlocality and quantum metrology. We put forward two families of entanglement measures termed $q$-$(k+1)$-PE concurrence $(q&gt;1)$ and $\alpha$-$(k+1)$-PE concurrence $(0\leq\alpha&lt;1)$, respectively. As far as the pure state is concerned, they are defined based on the minimum in entanglement. Meanwhile, rigorous proofs showing that both types of quantifications fulfill all the requirements of an entanglement measure are provided. In addition, we also propose two alternative kinds of entanglement measures, named $q$-$(k+1)$-GPE concurrence $(q&gt;1)$ and $\alpha$-$(k+1)$-GPE concurrence $(0\leq\alpha&lt;1)$, respectively, where the quantifications of any pure state are given by taking the geometric mean of entanglement under all partitions satisfying preconditions. Besides, the lower bounds of these measures are presented by means of the entanglement of permutationally invariant (PI) part of quantum states and the connections of these measures are offered. Moreover, we compare these measures and explain the similarities and differences among them. Furthermore, for computational convenience, we consider enhanced versions of the above quantifications that can be utilized to distinguish whether a multipartite state is genuinely strong $k$-producible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated quantum-classical approach that merges quantum computational dynamics with classical computing methodologies tailored to address control problems based on Pontryagin's minimum principle within a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework. By leveraging a dynamic quantum circuit that combines Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates, the study showcases an innovative approach to optimizing quantum state manipulations. The proposed hybrid model effectively applies machine learning techniques to solve optimal control problems. This is illustrated through the design and implementation of a hybrid PINN network to solve a quantum state transition problem in a two and three-level system, highlighting its potential across various quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks based quantum optimization algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optimization, one of the well-known classical algorithms is power iterations. Simply stated, the algorithm recovers the dominant eigenvector of some diagonalizable matrix. Since numerous optimization problems can be formulated as an eigenvalue/eigenvector search, this algorithm features wide applicability. Operationally, power iterations consist of performing repeated matrix-to-vector multiplications (or MatVec) followed by a renormilization step in order to converge to the dominant eigenvalue/eigenvector. However, classical realizations, including novel tensor network based approaches, necessitate an exponential scaling for the algorithm's run-time. In this paper, we propose a quantum realiziation to circumvent this pitfall. Our methodology involves casting low-rank representations; Matrix Product Operators (MPO) for matrices and Matrix Product States (MPS) for vectors, into quantum circuits. Specifically, we recover a unitary approximation by variationally minimizing the Frobenius distance between a target MPO and an MPO ansatz wherein the tensor cores are constrained to unitaries. Such an unitary MPO can easily be implemented as a quantum circuit with the addition of ancillary qubits. Thereafter, with appropriate initialization and post-selection on the ancillary space, we realize a single iteration of the classical algorithm. With our proposed methodology, power iterations can be realized entirely on a quantum computer via repeated, static circuit blocks; therefore, a run-time advantage can indeed be guaranteed. Moreover, by exploiting Riemannian optimization and cross-approximation techniques, our methodology becomes instance agnostic and thus allows one to address black-box optimization within the framework of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Achieving the volume-law entropy regime with random-sign Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating entanglement, which reflects non-local correlations in a quantum system and defines the complexity of describing its wave function, represents the extremely tough challenge in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In this work, by the example of the well-structured Dicke states we demonstrate that the complexity of these real-valued wave functions can be accurately tuned by introducing a random-sign structure, which allows us to explore the regime of the volume-law entanglement. Importantly, setting nontrivial sign structure one can increase the entanglement entropy of the Dicke state to the values that are close to Page's estimates for Haar-random states. The practical realization of these random-sign Dicke states is possible on different physical platforms with shallow quantum circuits. On the level of the measurements the change in the quantum state complexity due to sign structure can be traced out with the dissimilarity measure that estimates multi-scale variety of patterns in bit-string arrays.</description>

      <title>Hopping of the center-of-mass of single G centers in silicon-on-insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the wealth of single fluorescent defects recently detected in silicon, the G center catches interest for its telecom single-photon emission that could be coupled to a metastable electron spin triplet. The G center is a unique defect where the standard Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down as one of its atoms can move between 6 lattice sites under optical excitation. The impact of this atomic reconfiguration on the photoluminescence properties of G centers is still largely unknown, especially in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Here, we investigate the displacement of the center-of-mass of the G center in silicon. We show that single G defects in SOI exhibit a multipolar emission and zero-phonon line fine structures with splittings up to $\sim1$ meV, both indicating a motion of the defect central atom over time. Combining polarization and spectral analysis at the single-photon level, we evidence that the reconfiguration dynamics are drastically different from the one of the unperturbed G center in bulk silicon. The SOI structure freezes the delocalization of the G defect center-of-mass and as a result, enables to isolate linearly polarized optical lines. Under above-bandgap optical excitation, the central atom of G centers in SOI behaves as if it were in a 6-slot roulette wheel, randomly alternating between localized crystal sites at each optical cycle. Comparative measurements in a bulk silicon sample and ab initio calculations highlight that strain is likely the dominant perturbation impacting the G center geometry. These results shed light on the importance of the atomic reconfiguration dynamics to understand and control the photoluminescence properties of the G center in silicon. More generally, these findings emphasize the impact of strain fluctuations inherent to SOI wafers for future quantum integrated photonics applications based on color centers in silicon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum friction, a quantum analog of classical friction, reduces the performance of quantum machines, such as heat engines, and makes them less energy efficient. We here report the experimental realization of an energy efficient quantum engine coupled to a quantum battery that stores the produced work, using a single ion in a linear Paul trap. We first establish the quantum nature of the device by observing nonclassical work oscillations with the number of cycles as verified by energy measurements of the battery. We moreover successfully apply shortcut-to-adiabaticity techniques to suppress quantum friction and improve work production. While the average energy cost of the shortcut protocol is only about $3\%$, the work output is enhanced by up to approximately 33$\%$, making the machine significantly more energy efficient. In addition, we show that the quantum engine consistently outperforms its classical counterpart in this regime. Our results pave the way for energy efficient machines with quantum-enhanced performance.</description>

      <title>Tunable Gaussian Entanglement in Cavity-Magnon Optomechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanics, providing an inherently nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, have shown enomerous potential in generating macroscopic quantum entanglement. Here we propose to realize diverse bipartite and tripartite entanglement in cavity-magnon optomechanics. By introducing magnons to standard cavity optomechanics, not only tunable optomechanical entanglement and magnon-magnon entanglement can be achieved, but also flexible tripartite entanglement including magnon-photon-phonon entanglement, magnon-magnon-photon and -phonon entanglement can be generated. Moreover, optimal bipartite and tripartite entanglement can be achieved by tuning parameters. We further show that all entanglement can be enhanced via engineering the magnon-photon coupling,and is proven to be robust against the bath temperature within the survival temperature. Besides, we find that the optomechanical entanglement can be protected or restored by bad magnons with large decay rate, while other entanglement is severely reduced. The results indicate that our proposal provides a novel avenue to explore and control tunable macroscopic quantum effects in hybrid cavity-magnon optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement engines are autonomous quantum thermal machines designed to generate entanglement from the presence of a particle current flowing through the device. In this work, we investigate the functioning of a two-qubit entanglement engine beyond the steady-state regime. Within a master equation approach, we derive the time-dependent state, the particle current, as well as the associated current correlation functions. Our findings establish a direct connection between coherence and internal current, elucidating the existence of a critical current that serves as an indicator for entanglement in the steady state. We then apply our results to investigate kinetic uncertainty relations (KURs) at finite times. We demonstrate that there are more than one possible definitions for KURs at finite times. While the two definitions agree in the steady-state regime, they lead to different parameter's ranges for violating KUR at finite times.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Quantum Systems Emulation via a Variant of the Bandwidth Minimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces weighted-BMP, a variant of the Bandwidth Minimization Problem (BMP), with a significant application in optimizing quantum emulation. Weighted-BMP optimizes particles ordering to reduce the emulation costs, by designing a particle interaction matrix where strong interactions are placed as close as possible to the diagonal. We formulate the problem using a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and solve it to optimality with a state of the art solver. To strengthen our MILP model, we introduce symmetry-breaking inequalities and establish a lower bound. Through extensive numerical analysis, we examine the impacts of these enhancements on the solver's performance. The introduced reinforcements result in an average CPU time reduction of 25.61 percent. Additionally, we conduct quantum emulations of realistic instances. Our numerical tests show that the weighted-BMP approach outperforms the Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) algorithm, an efficient heuristic used for site ordering tasks in quantum emulation, achieving an average memory storage reduction of 24.48 percent. From an application standpoint, this study is the first to apply an exact optimization method, weighted-BMP, that considers interactions for site ordering in quantum emulation pre-processing, and shows its crucial role in cost reduction. From an algorithmic perspective, it contributes by introducing important reinforcements and lays the groundwork for future research on further enhancements, particularly on strengthening the weak linear relaxation of the MILP.</description>

      <title>Exploring Imaginary Coordinates: Disparity in the Shape of Quantum State Space in Even and Odd Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state of a finite-dimensional quantum system is described by a density matrix that can be decomposed into a real diagonal, a real off-diagonal and and an imaginary off-diagonal part. The latter plays a peculiar role. While it is intuitively clear that some of the imaginary coordinates cannot have the same extension as their real counterparts the precise relation is not obvious. We give a complete characterization of the constraints in terms of tight inequalities for real and imaginary Bloch-type coordinates. Our description entails a three-dimensional Bloch ball-type model for the state space. We uncover a surprising qualitative difference for the state-space boundaries in even and odd dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase of a two-level atom near a dielectric nanosphere out of thermal equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric phase (GP) of a two-level atom coupled to an environment composed of free space and a dielectric nanosphere in thermal and out of thermal equilibrium. We analytically and numerically analyze the optical properties and loss of the dielectric medium, along with the non-equilibrium effects of the environment on the GP. In the weak coupling limit, we find that the correction to the GP depends on the partial local density of photonic states at the atom position, and an effective parameter that emerges out of the non-equilibrium configuration of the system. The GP exhibits a significant enhancement due to the excitation of evanescent surface waves at its resonance frequency. It is shown that the GP acquired by the atomic system out of thermal equilibrium is always bounded between the thermal-equilibrium counterparts. Furthermore, the temperature difference between the nanosphere and free space can play an important role in the GP only at moderate atomic distances from the nanosphere. Our results elegantly demonstrate properties of the GP near material media that can support phononic modes and pave the way for further research of GP as a resource for quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ensembles of phase-covariant channels. We show that such ensembles arise naturally from familiar spin-chain models (e.g., XXZ) with a special class of initial states, and that the disorder-averaged map of disordered spin chains is phase-covariant under a weak symmetry constraint on the distribution. We use those examples to motivate a broader class of phase-covariant ensembles, which include both unital and non-unital channels. We demonstrate the physical properties captured by the late-time limit of the average map over the ensemble.</description>

      <title>Runtime-coherence trade-offs for hybrid SAT-solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many search-based quantum algorithms that achieve a theoretical speedup are not practically relevant since they require extraordinarily long coherence times, or lack the parallelizability of their classical counterparts.This raises the question of how to divide computational tasks into a collection of parallelizable sub-problems, each of which can be solved by a quantum computer with limited coherence time. Here, we approach this question via hybrid algorithms for the k-SAT problem. Our analysis is based on Sch\"oning's algorithm, which solves instances of k-SAT by performing random walks in the space of potential assignments. The search space of the walk allows for "natural" partitions, where we subject only one part of the partition to a Grover search, while the rest is sampled classically, thus resulting in a hybrid scheme. In this setting, we argue that there exists a simple trade-off relation between the total runtime and the coherence-time, which no such partition based hybrid-scheme can surpass. For several concrete choices of partitions, we explicitly determine the specific runtime coherence-time relations, and show saturation of the ideal trade-off. Finally, we present numerical simulations which suggest additional flexibility in implementing hybrid algorithms with optimal trade-off.</description>

      <title>Distributed Architecture for FPGA-based Superconducting Qubit Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits utilizing real time feedback techniques (such as active reset and mid-circuit measurement) are a powerful tool for NISQ-era quantum computing. Such techniques are crucial for implementing error correction protocols, and can reduce the resource requirements of certain quantum algorithms. Realizing these capabilities requires flexible, low-latency classical control. We have developed a custom FPGA-based processor architecture for QubiC, an open source platform for superconducting qubit control. Our architecture is distributed in nature, and consists of a bank of lightweight cores, each configured to control a small (1-3) number of signal generator channels. Each core is capable of executing parameterized control and readout pulses, as well as performing arbitrary control flow based on mid-circuit measurement results. We have also developed a modular compiler stack and domain-specific intermediate representation for programming the processor. Our representation allows users to specify circuits using both gate and pulse-level abstractions, and includes high-level control flow constructs (e.g. if-else blocks and loops). The compiler stack is designed to integrate with quantum software tools and programming languages, such as TrueQ, pyGSTi, and OpenQASM3. In this work, we will detail the design of both the processor and compiler stack, and demonstrate its capabilities with a quantum state teleportation experiment using transmon qubits at the LBNL Advanced Quantum Testbed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum optical pattern recognition method for binary classification tasks. Without direct image reconstruction, it classifies an object in terms of the rate of two-photon coincidences at the output of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, where both the input and the classifier parameters are encoded into single-photon states. Our method exhibits the same behaviour of a classical neuron of unit depth. Once trained, it shows a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in the number of computational operations and photons required by a single classification. This is a superexponential advantage over a classical neuron (that is at least linear in the image resolution). We provide simulations and analytical comparisons with analogous neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>LIGO operates with quantum noise below the Standard Quantum Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

Abstract: We explore Riemannian optimization methods for Restricted-Open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) and Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) methods. After showing that ROHF and CASSCF can be reformulated as optimization problems on so-called flag manifolds, we review Riemannian optimization basics and their application to these specific problems. We compare these methods to traditional ones and find robust convergence properties without fine-tuning of numerical parameters. Our study suggests Riemannian optimization as a valuable addition to orbital optimization for ROHF and CASSCF, warranting further investigation.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of electron irradiation for creating spin ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron vacancy centre ($V_{\rm B}^-$) ensembles in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted recent interest for their potential as two-dimensional solid-state quantum sensors. Irradiation is necessary for $V_{\rm B}^-$ creation, however, to date only limited attention has been given to optimising the defect production process, especially in the case of bulk irradiation with high-energy particles, which offers scalability through the potential for creating ensembles in large volumes of material. Here we systematically investigate the effect of electron irradiation by varying the dose delivered to a range of hBN samples, which differ in their purity, and search for an optimum in measurement sensitivity. We find that moderate electron irradiation doses ($\approx 5\times 10^{18}$~cm$^{-2}$) appear to offer the best sensitivity, and also observe a dependence on the initial crystal purity. These results pave the way for the scalable and cost-effective production of hBN quantum sensors, and provide insight into the mechanisms limiting $V_{\rm B}^-$ spin properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note discusses a method for computing the energy spectra of quantum field theory utilizing digital quantum simulation. A quantum algorithm, called coherent imaging spectroscopy, quenches the vacuum with a time-oscillating perturbation and then reads off the excited energy levels from the loss in the vacuum-to-vacuum probability following the quench. As a practical demonstration, we apply this algorithm to the (1+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with a topological term known as the Schwinger model, where the conventional Monte Carlo approach is practically inaccessible. In particular, on a classical simulator, we prepare the vacuum of the Schwinger model on a lattice by adiabatic state preparation and then apply various types of quenches to the approximate vacuum through Suzuki-Trotter time evolution. We discuss the dependence of the simulation results on the specific types of quenches and introduce various consistency checks, including the exact diagonalization and the continuum limit extrapolation. The estimation of the computational complexity required to obtain physically reasonable results implies that the method is likely efficient in the coming era of early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: In optics and photonics, a small number of building blocks, like resonators, waveguides, arbitrary couplings, and parametric interactions, allow the design of a broad variety of devices and functionalities, distinguished by their scattering properties. These include transducers, amplifiers, and nonreciprocal devices, like isolators or circulators. Usually, the design of such a system is handcrafted by an experienced scientist in a time-consuming process where it remains uncertain whether the simplest possibility has indeed been found. In our work, we develop a discovery algorithm that automates this challenge. By optimizing the continuous and discrete system properties our automated search identifies the minimal resources required to realize the requested scattering behavior. In the spirit of artificial scientific discovery, it produces a complete list of interpretable solutions and leads to generalizable insights, as we illustrate in several examples. This now opens the door to rapid design in areas like photonic and microwave architectures or optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Relations in Quantum Theory: An Objective Account of Bases and Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In orthodox Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) bases and factorizations are considered to define quantum states and entanglement in relativistic terms. While the choice of a basis (interpreted as a measurement context) defines a state incompatible to that same state in a different basis, the choice of a factorization (interpreted as the separability of systems into sub-systems) determines wether the same state is entangled or non-entangled. Of course, this perspectival relativism with respect to reference frames and factorizations precludes not only the widespread reference to quantum particles but more generally the possibility of any rational objective account of a state of affairs in general. In turn, this impossibility ends up justifying the instrumentalist (anti-realist) approach that contemporary quantum physics has followed since the establishment of SQM during the 1930s. In contraposition, in this work, taking as a standpoint the logos categorical approach to QM -- basically, Heisenberg's matrix formulation without Dirac's projection postulate -- we provide an invariant account of bases and factorizations which allows us to to build a conceptual-operational bridge between the mathematical formalism and quantum phenomena. In this context we are able to address the set of equivalence relations which allows us to determine what is actually the same in different bases and factorizations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Hilbert-space fragmentation and fractonic excitations in two-dimensional Hubbard systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation behaviour of isolated quantum systems taken out of equilibrium is among the most intriguing questions in many-body physics. Quantum systems out of equilibrium typically relax to thermal equilibrium states by scrambling local information and building up entanglement entropy. However, kinetic constraints in the Hamiltonian can lead to a breakdown of this fundamental paradigm due to a fragmentation of the underlying Hilbert space into dynamically decoupled subsectors in which thermalisation can be strongly suppressed. Here, we experimentally observe Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a two-dimensional tilted Bose-Hubbard model. Using quantum gas microscopy, we engineer a wide variety of initial states and find a rich set of manifestations of HSF involving bulk states, interfaces and defects, i.e., d = 2, 1 and 0 dimensional objects. Specifically, uniform initial states with equal particle number and energy differ strikingly in their relaxation dynamics. Inserting controlled defects on top of a global, non-thermalising chequerboard state, we observe highly anisotropic, sub-dimensional dynamics, an immediate signature of their fractonic nature. An interface between localized and thermalising states in turn displays dynamics depending on its orientation. Our results mark the first observation of HSF beyond one dimension, as well as the concomitant direct observation of fractons, and pave the way for in-depth studies of microscopic transport phenomena in constrained systems</description>

      <title>Entanglement measures of Majorana bound states</title>

Abstract: Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale single-electron box with a floating lead for quantum sensing: modelling and device characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of a single-electron box (SEB) biased through a floating node technique that is common in charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The device is analyzed and characterized in the context of single-electron charge-sensing techniques for integrated silicon quantum dots (QD). The unique aspect of our SEB design is the incorporation of a metallic floating node, strategically employed for sensing and precise injection of electrons into an electrostatically formed QD. To analyse the SEB, we propose an extended multi-orbital Anderson impurity model (MOAIM), adapted to our nanoscale SEB system, that is used to predict theoretically the behaviour of the SEB in the context of a charge-sensing application. The validation of the model and the sensing technique has been carried out on a QD fabricated in a fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) process on a 22-nm technological node. We demonstrate the MOAIM's efficacy in predicting the observed electronic behavior and elucidating the complex electron dynamics and correlations in the SEB. The results of our study reinforce the versatility and precision of the model in the realm of nanoelectronics and highlight the practical utility of the metallic floating node as a mechanism for charge injection and detection in integrated QDs. Finally, we identify the limitations of our model in capturing higher-order effects observed in our measurements and propose future outlooks to reconcile some of these discrepancies.</description>

Abstract: Is there an algorithm to determine attributes such as positivity or non-zeroness of linear recurrence sequences? This long-standing question is known as Skolem's problem. In this paper, we study the complexity of an equivalent problem, namely the (generalized) moment membership problem for matrices. We show that this problem is decidable for orthogonal, unitary and real eigenvalue matrices, and undecidable for matrices over certain commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. Our results imply that the positivity problem for simple unitary linear recurrence sequences is decidable, and is undecidable for linear recurrence sequences over the ring of commutative polynomials. As a byproduct, we prove a free version of Polya's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the concepts of quantum entanglement and coherence to analyze the Unruh and anti-Unruh effects based on the model of Unruh-DeWitt detector. For the first time, we find that (i) the Unruh effect reduces quantum entanglement but enhances quantum coherence; (ii) the anti-Unruh effect enhances quantum entanglement but reduces quantum coherence. This surprising result refutes the notion that the Unruh effect can only destroy quantum entanglement and coherence simultaneously, and that the anti-Unruh can only protect quantum resources. Consequently, it opens up a new source for discovering experimental evidence supporting the existence of the Unruh and anti-Unruh effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective quantum communication requires room temperature (RT) operating single photon sensor with high photo detection efficiency (PDE) at 1550 nm wavelength. The leading class of devices in this segment is avalanche photo detectors operating particularly in the Geiger mode. Often the requirements for RT operation and for the high PDE are in conflict, resulting in a compromised solution. We have developed a device which employs a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material on a co-optimized dielectric photonic crystal substrate to simultaneously decrease the dark current by orders of magnitude and increase the PDE. The device is predicted to achieve RT operation with a PDE &gt;99%. Harnessing the high carrier mobility of 2D materials, the device has ~ps jitter time and can be integrated into a large 2D array camera.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Formalism for PT-Symmetric Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the Lindblad Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of Lindblad decoherence, i.e. dissipative effects in an open quantum system due to interaction with an environment, we examine the transition probabilities between the eigenstates in the two-level quantum system described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the Lindblad equation, for which the parity-time-reversal (PT) symmetry is conserved. First, the density matrix formalism for PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems is developed. It is shown that the Lindblad operators $L^{}_j$ are pseudo-Hermitian, namely, $\eta L^{}_j \eta^{-1} = L^\dagger_j$ with $\eta$ being a linear and positive-definite metric, and respect the PT symmetry as well. We demonstrate that the generalized density matrix $\rho^{}_{\rm G}(t) \equiv \rho(t) \eta$, instead of the normalized density matrix $\rho^{}_{\rm N}(t) \equiv \rho(t)/{\rm tr}\left[\rho(t)\right]$, should be implemented for the calculation of the transition probabilities in accordance with the linearity requirement. Second, the density matrix formalism is used to derive the transition probabilities in general cases of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In some concrete examples, we calculate compact analytical formulas for the transition probabilities and explore their main features with numerical illustrations. We also make a comparison between our present results and our previous ones using state vectors in the absence of Lindblad decoherence.</description>

Abstract: A semidefinite program (SDP) is a particular kind of convex optimization problem with applications in operations research, combinatorial optimization, quantum information science, and beyond. In this work, we propose variational quantum algorithms for approximately solving SDPs. For one class of SDPs, we provide a rigorous analysis of their convergence to approximate locally optimal solutions, under the assumption that they are weakly constrained (i.e., $N\gg M$, where $N$ is the dimension of the input matrices and $M$ is the number of constraints). We also provide algorithms for a more general class of SDPs that requires fewer assumptions. Finally, we numerically simulate our quantum algorithms for applications such as MaxCut, and the results of these simulations provide evidence that convergence still occurs in noisy settings.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast adiabatic passages in ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have obtained the solutions of the multimode quantum Rabi model when all modes have identical frequencies $\omega$, including dark states $|\phi_K\rangle$ with at least $K$ $(K=1,2,3,\ldots)$ photons. Extended to the multiqubit case, they lie close to another dark state $\vert \psi\rangle$ with at most one photon in the spectrum. Taking advantages of such solutions, we find a linear and symmetry-protected adiabatic passage through $\vert \psi\rangle$ to fast generate arbitrary single-photon $M$-mode $W$ states $\vert W_M\rangle$ with exactly the same speed. The effective minimum energy gap during the adiabatic evolution is further enlarged to $0.63\omega$ when Stark shifts are included, such that arbitrary $\vert W_M\rangle$ can be ultrafast generated in $1.55\times 2\pi\omega^{-1}$ with fidelity $99\%$, indepedent of $M$. This work reveals the existence of linear ultrafast adiabatic passages in light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Real-Time Polarization Compensation for MDI-QKD with Rejected Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) closes all the security loopholes in the detection system and is a promising solution for secret key sharing. Polarization encoding is the most common QKD encoding scheme, as it is straightforward to prepare and measure. However, implementing polarization encoding in MDI QKD imposes extra challenges, as polarization alignment must be maintained over both mutually unbiased bases and be maintained for both paths (Alice-Charlie and Bob-Charlie). Polarization alignment is usually done by interrupting the QKD process (reducing overall key generation rates) or using additional classical laser sources multiplexed with quantum channels for polarization alignment. Since low key rates and cost are the two most pressing challenges preventing wide adoption of QKD systems, using additional resources or reducing key rates runs contrary to making QKD commercially viable. Therefore, we propose and implement a novel polarization compensation scheme in the MDI-QKD system that avoids the aforementioned drawbacks by recycling part of discarded detection events. Our scheme evaluates the polarization drift in real-time based on single measurements corresponding to decoy intensities. Our fully automated experimental demonstration maintains the average polarization drift below 0.13 rad over 40 km of spooled fibre (without an insulating jacket) for at least four hours. The average quantum bit error rate is 3.8$\%$, and we achieved an average key rate of $7.45\times 10^{-6}$ bits per pulse.</description>

Abstract: A strategy is developed for writing the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation (TDSE), and more generally the Dyson Series, as a convolution equation using recursive Fourier transforms, thereby decoupling the second-order integral from the first without using the time ordering operator. The energy distribution is calculated for a number of standard perturbation theory example at first- and second-order. Possible applications include characterization of photonic spectra for bosonic sampling and four-wave mixing in quantum computation, and Bardeen tunneling amplitude in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos with the entropy of decoherent histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum chaos, a phenomenon that began to be studied in the last century, still does not have a rigorous understanding. By virtue of the correspondence principle, the properties of the system that lead to chaotic dynamics at the classical level must also be present in the underlying quantum system. In the classical case, the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories in time is described in terms of the Lyapunov exponent. However, in the quantum case, a similar description of chaos is, strictly speaking, impossible due to absence of trajectories. There are different approaches to remedy this situation, but the universal criterion of quantum chaos is absent. We propose the quantum chaos definition in the manner similar to the classical one using decoherent histories as a quantum analogue of trajectories. For this purpose, we consider the model of an open quantum kicked top interacting with the environment, which is a bosonic bath, and illustrate this idea. Here, the environment plays the role of a trajectory recording device. For the kicked top model at the classical level, depending on the kick strength, crossover occurs between the integrable and chaotic regimes. We show that for such a model, the production of entropy of decoherent histories is radically different in integrable and chaotic regimes. Thus, the entropy of an ensemble of quantum trajectories can be used as a signature of quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method that enables two remote parties to share a secure key string. Clock synchronization between two parties is a crucial step in the normal operation of QKD. Qubit-based synchronization can achieve clock synchronization by transmitting quantum states between two remote parties, eliminating the necessity for hardware synchronization and thereby greatly reducing the hardware requirements of a QKD system. Nonetheless, classical qubit-based synchronization exhibits poor performance in continuous and high-loss systems, hindering its wide applicability in various scenarios. We propose a qubit-based distributed frame synchronization method that can achieve time recovery in a continuously running system and resist higher losses. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the advanced qubit-based synchronization method Qubit4Sync in a continuously running system. We believe our method is applicable to a broad range of QKD scenarios, including drone-based QKD and quantum network construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a physical layer encryption technique that enables two distant parties to exchange secure keys with information-theoretic security. In the last two decades, QKD has transitioned from laboratory research to real-world applications, including multi-user quantum access networks (QANs). This network structure allows users to share a single-photon detector at a network node through time-division multiplexing, thereby significantly reducing the network cost. However, current QAN implementations require additional hardware for auxiliary tasks such as time synchronization. To address this issue, we propose a cost-efficient QAN that uses qubit-based synchronization. In this approach, the transmitted qubits facilitate time synchronization, eliminating the need for additional synchronization hardware. We tested our scheme by implementing a network for two users and successfully achieved average secure key rates of $53.84$ kbps and $71.90$ kbps for each user over a 50-km commercial fiber spool. In addition, we investigated the capacity of the access network under cross-talk and loss conditions. The simulation results demonstrate that this scheme can support a QAN with 64 users with key rates up to 1070~bps. Our work provides a feasible and cost-effective way to implement a multi-user QKD network, further promoting the widespread application of QKD.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of vibrationally assisted energy transfer by proximity to exceptional points, probed by fluorescence-detected vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emulation of energy transfer processes in natural systems on quantum platforms can further our understanding of complex dynamics in nature. One notable example is the demonstration of vibrationally assisted energy transfer (VAET) on a trapped-ion quantum emulator, which offers insights for the energetics of light harvesting. In this work, we expand the study of VAET simulation with trapped ions to a non-Hermitian quantum system comprising a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric chromophore dimer weakly coupled to a vibrational mode. We first characterize exceptional points (EPs) and non- Hermitian features of the excitation energy transfer processes in the absence of the vibration, finding a degenerate pair of second-order EPs. Exploring the non-Hermitian dynamics of the whole system including vibrations, we find that energy transfer accompanied by absorption of phonons from a vibrational mode can be significantly enhanced near such a degenerate EP. Our calculations reveal a unique spectral feature accompanying the coalescing of eigenstates and eigenenergies that provides a novel approach to probe the degenerate EP by fluorescence-detected vibrational spectroscopy. Enhancement of the VAET process near the EP is found to be due to maximal favorability of phonon absorption at the degenerate EP, enabling multiple simultaneous excitations. Our work on improving VAET processes in non-Hermitian quantum systems paves the way for leveraging non-Hermiticity in quantum dynamics related to excitation energy transfer.</description>

      <title>On the optimal error exponents for classical and quantum antidistinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of antidistinguishability of quantum states has been studied to investigate foundational questions in quantum mechanics. It is also called quantum state elimination, because the goal of such a protocol is to guess which state, among finitely many chosen at random, the system is not prepared in (that is, it can be thought of as the first step in a process of elimination). Antidistinguishability has been used to investigate the reality of quantum states, ruling out $\psi$-epistemic ontological models of quantum mechanics [Pusey et al., Nat. Phys., 8(6):475-478, 2012]. Thus, due to the established importance of antidistinguishability in quantum mechanics, exploring it further is warranted.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of the optimal error exponent -- the rate at which the optimal error probability vanishes to zero asymptotically -- for classical and quantum antidistinguishability. We derive an exact expression for the optimal error exponent in the classical case and show that it is given by the multivariate classical Chernoff divergence. Our work thus provides this divergence with a meaningful operational interpretation as the optimal error exponent for antidistinguishing a set of probability measures. For the quantum case, we provide several bounds on the optimal error exponent: a lower bound given by the best pairwise Chernoff divergence of the states, a single-letter semi-definite programming upper bound, and lower and upper bounds in terms of minimal and maximal multivariate quantum Chernoff divergences. It remains an open problem to obtain an explicit expression for the optimal error exponent for quantum antidistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Every quantum helps: Operational advantage of quantum resources beyond convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying what quantum-mechanical properties are useful to untap a superior performance in quantum technologies is a pivotal question. Quantum resource theories provide a unified framework to analyze and understand such properties, as successfully demonstrated for entanglement and coherence. While these are examples of convex resources, for which quantum advantages can always be identified, many physical resources are described by a nonconvex set of free states and their interpretation has so far remained elusive. Here we address the fundamental question of the usefulness of quantum resources without convexity assumption, by providing two operational interpretations of the generalized robustness measure in general resource theories. First, we characterize the generalized robustness in terms of a nonlinear resource witness and reveal that any state is more advantageous than a free one in some multicopy channel discrimination task. Next, we consider a scenario where a theory is characterized by multiple constraints and show that the generalized robustness coincides with the worst-case advantage in a single-copy channel discrimination setting. Based on these characterizations, we conclude that every quantum resource state shows a qualitative and quantitative advantage in discrimination problems in a general resource theory even without any specification on the structure of the free states.</description>

      <title>Robustness- and weight-based resource measures without convexity restriction: Multicopy witness and operational advantage in static and dynamical quantum resource theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework to analyze quantum properties as resources for achieving advantages in quantum information processing. The generalized robustness and the weight of resource have been gaining increasing attention as useful resource quantifiers. However, the existing analyses of these measures were restricted to the cases where convexity of the set of free states is assumed, and physically motivated resources do not necessarily satisfy this restriction. In this paper, we give characterizations of robustness- and weight-based measures in general QRTs without convexity restriction through two different yet related approaches. On the one hand, we characterize the generalized robustness and the weight of resource by introducing a nonlinear witness. We show a general construction of new witness observables that detect the resourcefulness of a given state from multiple copies of the state and, using these witnesses, we provide operational interpretations of the above resource measures even without any convexity assumption. On the other hand, we find that the generalized robustness and the weight of resource can also be interpreted as the worst-case maximum advantage in variants of channel-discrimination and channel-exclusion tasks, respectively, where the set of free states consists of several convex subsets corresponding to multiple restrictions. We further extend these results to QRTs for quantum channels and quantum instruments. These characterizations show that every quantum resource exhibits an advantage for the corresponding tasks, even in general QRTs without convexity assumption. Thus, we establish the usefulness of robustness-based and weight-based techniques beyond the conventional scope of convex QRTs, leading to a better understanding of the general structure of QRTs.</description>

      <title>Entanglement phase transitions in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between unitary time-evolution and quantum measurements could induce phase transitions in the entanglement characteristics of quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we reveal such entanglement transitions in the context of non-Hermitian Floquet systems. Focusing on noninteracting fermions in a representative bipartite lattice with balanced gain/loss and under time-periodic quenches, we uncover rich patterns of entanglement transitions due to the interplay between driving and non-Hermitian effects. Specially, we find that the monotonic increase of quenched hopping amplitude could flip the system between volume-law and area-law entangled Floquet phases, yielding alternated entanglement transitions. Meanwhile, the raise of gain/loss strength could trigger area-law to volume-law reentrant transitions in the scaling behavior of steady-state entanglement entropy, which are abnormal and highly unexpected in non-driven systems. Connections between entanglement transitions and parity-time-reversal (PT) transitions in Floquet spectra are further established. Our findings not only build a foundation for exploring entanglement phase transitions in Floquet non-Hermitian setups, but also provide efficient means to engineer and control such transitions by driving fields.</description>

      <title>Minimal Clifford Shadow Estimation by Mutually Unbiased Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting properties of large-scale quantum systems is crucial for the development of quantum science and technology. Shadow estimation is an efficient method for this task based on randomized measurements, where many-qubit random Clifford circuits are used for estimating global properties like quantum fidelity. Here we introduce the minimal Clifford measurement (MCM) to reduce the number of possible random circuits to the minimum, while keeping the effective post-processing channel in shadow estimation. In particular, we show that MCM requires $2^n+1$ distinct Clifford circuits, and it can be realized by Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUB), with $n$ as the total qubit number. By applying the Z-Tableau formalism, this ensemble of circuits can be synthesized to the $\mathrm{-S-CZ-H-}$ structure, which can be composed by $2n-1$ fixed circuit modules, and the total circuit depth is at most $n+1$. Compared to the original Clifford measurements, our MCM significantly reduces the circuit complexity and the compilation costs. In addition, we find the sampling advantage of MCM on estimating off-diagonal operators, and extend this observation to the biased-MCM scheme to enhance the sampling improvement further.</description>

      <title>Verifying the security of a continuous variable quantum communication protocol via quantum metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics offers the possibility of unconditionally secure communication between multiple remote parties. Security proofs for such protocols typically rely on bounding the capacity of the quantum channel in use. In a similar manner, Cram\'er-Rao bounds in quantum metrology place limits on how much information can be extracted from a given quantum state about some unknown parameters of interest. In this work we establish a connection between these two areas. We first demonstrate a three-party sensing protocol, where the attainable precision is dependent on how many parties work together. This protocol is then mapped to a secure access protocol, where only by working together can the parties gain access to some high security asset. Finally, we map the same task to a communication protocol where we demonstrate that a higher mutual information can be achieved when the parties work collaboratively compared to any party working in isolation.</description>

      <title>Quest for optimal quantum resetting: protocols for a particle on a chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical context, it is well known that, sometimes, if the search does not find its target, it is better to start the process anew again, known as resetting. The quantum counterpart of resetting also indicates speeding up the detection process by eliminating the dark states, i.e., situations where the particle avoids detection. In this work, we introduce a most probable position resetting (MPR) protocol in which we reset the particle in a position where the probability of finding the particle could have been maximum, provided one would let the system evolve Unitarily in a given time window. In a tight-binding lattice model, there exists a 2-fold degeneracy (left and right) of the positions of maximum probability. The survival probability with optimal restart rate approaches zero (detection probability approaches one) when the particle is reset with equal probability on both sides. This protocol significantly reduces the optimal mean first-detected-passage time (FDT) and performs better even if the detector is far apart compared to the usual resetting protocols where the particle is brought back to the initial position. We propose a modified protocol, adaptive two-stage MPR, by making the associated probabilities of resetting to the right and left a function of resetting steps. In this protocol, we see a further reduction of the optimal mean FDT and improvement in the search process when the detector is far apart.</description>

      <title>DGR: Tackling Drifted and Correlated Noise in Quantum Error Correction via Decoding Graph Re-weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from high error rates and noise, which makes directly running applications on them ineffective. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is a critical technique towards fault tolerance which encodes the quantum information distributively in multiple data qubits and uses syndrome qubits to check parity. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) is a popular QEC decoder that takes the syndromes as input and finds the matchings between syndromes that infer the errors. However, there are two paramount challenges for MWPM decoders. First, as noise in real quantum systems can drift over time, there is a potential misalignment with the decoding graph's initial weights, leading to a severe performance degradation in the logical error rates. Second, while the MWPM decoder addresses independent errors, it falls short when encountering correlated errors typical on real hardware, such as those in the 2Q depolarizing channel.
  We propose DGR, an efficient decoding graph edge re-weighting strategy with no quantum overhead. It leverages the insight that the statistics of matchings across decoding iterations offer rich information about errors on real quantum hardware. By counting the occurrences of edges and edge pairs in decoded matchings, we can statistically estimate the up-to-date probabilities of each edge and the correlations between them. The reweighting process includes two vital steps: alignment re-weighting and correlation re-weighting. The former updates the MWPM weights based on statistics to align with actual noise, and the latter adjusts the weight considering edge correlations.
  Extensive evaluations on surface code and honeycomb code under various settings show that DGR reduces the logical error rate by 3.6x on average-case noise mismatch with exceeding 5000x improvement under worst-case mismatch.</description>

      <title>The discrete adiabatic quantum linear system solver has lower constant factors than the randomized adiabatic solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of linear systems of equations is the basis of many other quantum algorithms, and recent results provided an algorithm with optimal scaling in both the condition number $\kappa$ and the allowable error $\epsilon$ [PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 0403003 (2022)]. That work was based on the discrete adiabatic theorem, and worked out an explicit constant factor for an upper bound on the complexity. Here we show via numerical testing on random matrices that the constant factor is in practice about 1,500 times smaller than the upper bound found numerically in the previous results. That means that this approach is far more efficient than might naively be expected from the upper bound. In particular, it is over an order of magnitude more efficient than using a randomised approach from [arXiv:2305.11352] that claimed to be more efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply preconditioning, which is widely used in classical solvers for linear systems $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$, to the variational quantum linear solver. By utilizing incomplete LU factorization as a preconditioner for linear equations formed by $128\times128$ random sparse matrices, we numerically demonstrate a notable reduction in the required ansatz depth, demonstrating that preconditioning is useful for quantum algorithms. This reduction in circuit depth is crucial to improving the efficiency and accuracy of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Our findings suggest that combining classical computing techniques, such as preconditioning, with quantum algorithms can significantly enhance the performance of NISQ algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We study Floquet systems with translationally invariant nearest-neighbor 2-site gates. Depending on the order in which the gates are applied on an N-site system with periodic boundary conditions, there are factorially many different circuit configurations. We prove that there are only N-1 different spectrally equivalent classes which can be viewed either as a generalization of the brick-wall or of the staircase configuration. Every class, characterized by two integers, has a nontrivial space-time symmetry with important implications for the level-spacing distribution -- a standard indicator of quantum chaos. Namely, in order to study chaoticity one should not look at eigenphases of the Floquet propagator itself, but rather at the spectrum of an appropriate root of the propagator.</description>

Abstract: Studying chemical reactions, particularly in the gas phase, relies heavily on computing scattering matrix elements. These elements are essential for characterizing molecular reactions and accurately determining reaction probabilities. However, the intricate nature of quantum interactions poses challenges, necessitating the use of advanced mathematical models and computational approaches to tackle the inherent complexities. In this study, we develop and apply a quantum algorithm for the calculation of scattering matrix elements. In our approach, we employ the time-dependent method based on the M\"oller operator formulation where the S-matrix element between the respective reactant and product channels is determined through the time correlation function of the reactant and product M\"oller wavepackets. We successfully apply our quantum algorithm to calculate scattering matrix elements for 1D semi-infinite square well potential and on the co-linear hydrogen exchange reaction. As we navigate the complexities of quantum interactions, this quantum algorithm is general and emerges as a promising avenue, shedding light on new possibilities for simulating chemical reactions on quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tomography approaches typically consider a set of observables which we wish to measure, design a measurement scheme which measures each of the observables and then repeats the measurements as many times as necessary. We show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Closing Optical Bloch Equations in waveguide QED: Dynamics, Energetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical Bloch Equations (OBE) model the dynamics of a classically driven two-level atom coupled to a thermal electromagnetic field. From a global viewpoint, they derive from the unitary evolution of a closed, isolated atom-field system. We study the emergence of the OBE in the case where the driving and the thermal fields are confined in one spatial dimension -- a situation usually found in waveguide-QED. The joint atom-field system forms a "one-dimensional atom" (1D atom) whose closed dynamics can be solved, providing access to light-matter correlations. Such closure of the OBE unveils a new term capturing the driving of the atom by itself, or self-drive, which is proportional to the atom coherences in the energy basis. A 1D atom also constitutes an autonomous, energy-conserving system. Hence, energy exchanges between the atom and the field can be conveniently analyzed as closed first laws, where work-like (heat-like) flows stem from effective unitaries (correlations) exerted by one system on the other. We show that the closed and the open approaches only differ by the atom self-work, which yields a tighter expression of the second law. We quantitatively relate this tightening to the extra-knowledge acquired by closing the OBE. The concepts and effects we introduce deepen our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and its potential for energy management at quantum scales. They can be probed in state-of-the-art quantum hardware, e.g. superconducting and photonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum plasmonic sensor using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry that measures the refractive index of an analyte, embedded in a plasmonic beam splitter composed of a dual-Kretschmann configuration, which serves as a frustrated total internal reflection beamsplitter. The sensing performance of the HOM interferometry, combined with single-photon detectors, is evaluated through Fisher information for estimation of the refractive index of the analyte. This is subsequently compared with the classical benchmark that considers the injection of a coherent state of light into the plasmonic beamsplitter. By varying the wavelength of the single photons and the refractive index of the analyte, we identify a wide range where a 50 % quantum enhancement is achieved and discuss the observed behaviors in comparison with the classical benchmark. We expect this study to provide a useful insight into the advancement of quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, with direct implications for a wide range of nanophotonic beamsplitter structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of a charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field : an analysis of the roles of coupling via position and momentum variables</title>

Abstract: The study of decoherence plays a key role in our understanding of the transition from the quantum to the classical world. Typically, one considers a system coupled to an external bath which forms a model for an open quantum system. While most of the studies pertain to a position coupling between the system and the environment, some involve a momentum coupling, giving rise to an anomalous diffusive model. Here we have gone beyond existing studies and analysed the quantum Langevin dynamics of a harmonically oscillating charged Brownian particle in the presence of a magnetic field and coupled to an Ohmic heat bath via both position and momentum couplings. The presence of both position and momentum couplings leads to a stronger interaction with the environment, resulting in a faster loss of coherence compared to a situation where only position coupling is present. The rate of decoherence can be tuned by controlling the relative strengths of the position and momentum coupling parameters. In addition, the magnetic field results in the slowing down of the loss of information from the system, irrespective of the nature of coupling between the system and the bath. Our results can be experimentally verified by designing a suitable ion trap setup.</description>

      <title>A Modular Approach to Unclonable Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a new pathway to designing unclonable cryptographic primitives. We propose a new notion called unclonable puncturable obfuscation (UPO) and study its implications for unclonable cryptography. Using UPO, we present modular (and arguably, simple) constructions of many primitives in unclonable cryptography, including public-key quantum money, quantum copy-protection for many classes of functionalities, unclonable encryption, and single-decryption encryption. Notably, we obtain the following new results assuming the existence of UPO: We show that any cryptographic functionality can be copy-protected as long as this functionality satisfies a notion of security, which we term as puncturable security. Prior feasibility results focused on copy-protecting specific cryptographic functionalities. We show that copy-protection exists for any class of evasive functions as long as the associated distribution satisfies a preimage-sampleability condition. Prior works demonstrated copy-protection for point functions, which follows as a special case of our result. We show that unclonable encryption exists in the plain model. Prior works demonstrated feasibility results in the quantum random oracle model. We put forward a candidate construction of UPO and prove two notions of security, each based on the existence of (post-quantum) sub-exponentially secure indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions, the quantum hardness of learning with errors, and a new conjecture called simultaneous inner product conjecture.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Quantum Light Sources for Underwater Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication has been at the forefront of modern research for decades, however it is severely hampered in underwater applications, where the properties of water absorb nearly all useful optical wavelengths and prevent them from propagating more than, in most cases, a few metres. This research reports on-demand quantum light sources, suitable for underwater optical communication. The single photon emitters, which can be engineered using an electron beam, are based on impurities in hexagonal boron nitride. They have a zero phonon line at ~ 436 nm, near the minimum value of water absorption and are shown to suffer negligible transmission and purity loss when travelling through water channels. These emitters are also shown to possess exceptional underwater transmission properties compared to emitters at other optical wavelengths and are utilised in a proof of principle underwater communication link with rates of several kbits/s.</description>

      <title>Density-Matrix Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring various phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems characterized by strong quantum fluctuations. In this article, we propose a novel mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations but can even detect the topological order of quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides a novel and efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>
