      <title>Topological photonic alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the new concept of photonic alloy as a non-periodic topological material. By mixing non-magnetized and magnetized rods in a non-periodic 2D photonic crystal configuration, we realized photonic alloys in the microwave regime. Our experimental findings reveal that the photonic alloy sustains non-reciprocal chiral edge states (CESs) even at very low concentration of magnetized rods. The non-trivial topology and the associated edge states of these non-periodic systems can be characterized by the winding of the reflection phase. Our results indicate that the threshold concentrations for the investigated system within the first non-trivial band gap to exhibit topological behavior approach zero in the thermodynamic limit for substitutional alloys, while the threshold remains non-zero for interstitial alloys. At low concentration, the system exhibits an inhomogeneous structure characterized by isolated patches of non-percolating magnetic domains that are spaced far apart within a topologically trivial photonic crystal. Surprisingly, the system manifests CESs despite a local breakdown of time-reversal symmetry rather than a global one. Photonic alloys represent a new category of disordered topological materials, offering exciting opportunities for exploring topological materials with adjustable gaps.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the Hydrostatic Stress for Hall Droplets with in-plane Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the hydrostatic stress of electrons strongly confined in a quasi-2D quantum well in the presence of a strong perpendicular and weak in-plane magnetic field. This introduces anisotropy into the stress tensor which is inconsistent with the notion of the quantum Hall droplet as a simple two-dimensional electron fluid. We show that the breaking of rotational symmetry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an anisotropic ground state stress tensor, and that the anisotropic stress originates primarily from quantum effects. We demonstrate this by decomposing the semiclassical trajectories of electrons in the system onto planes in phase space which must be rotated relative to the plane of the fluid to decouple the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Chaotic magnetization dynamics driven by feedback magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitation of highly nonlinear, complex magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet, for example chaos, is a new research target in spintronics. This technology is applied to practical applications such as random number generator and information processing systems. One way to induce complex dynamics is applying feedback effect to the ferromagnet. The role of the feedback electric current on the magnetization dynamics was studied in the past. However, there is another way to apply feedback effect to the ferromagnet, namely feedback magnetic field. In this paper, we developed both numerical and theoretical analyses on the role of the feedback magnetic field causing complex magnetization dynamics. The numerical simulation indicates the change of the dynamical behavior from a simple oscillation with a unique frequency to complex dynamics such as amplitude modulation and chaos. The theoretical analyses on the equation of motion qualitatively explain several features found in the numerical simulations, exemplified as an appearance of multipeak structure in the Fourier spectra. The difference of the role of the feedback electric current and magnetic field is also revealed from the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <title>Predicting edge-localized monovacancy defects in zigzag graphene nanoribbons from Floquet quasienergy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prescribe a theoretical framework aiming at predicting the position of monovacancy defects at the edges of zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) using Floquet-Bloch formalism, which can be experimentally observed through time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (tr-ARPES). Our methodology involves an in-depth investigation of the Floquet quasienergy band spectrum influenced by light with varying polarization across a range of frequencies. Particularly under the influence of circularly polarized light with a frequency comparable to the bandwidth of the system, our findings suggest a promising approach for locating monovacancy defects at either edge, a challenge that proves intricate to predict from the ARPES spectrum of ZGNRs with monovacancy defects. This has been achieved by analyzing the orientation of the Floquet edge state and the appearance of new Dirac points in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The real-world applications of these captivating characteristics underscore the importance and pertinence of our theoretical framework, paving the way for additional exploration and practical use. Our approach, employing the Floquet formalism, is not limited to monovacancy-type defects; rather, it can be expanded to encompass various types of vacancy defects.</description>

      <title>Beyond the standard model of topological Josephson junctions: From crystalline anisotropy to finite-size and diode effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planar Josephson junction is a versatile platform to realize topological superconductivity over a large parameter space and host Majorana bound states. With a change in Zeeman field, this system undergoes a transition from trivial to topological superconductivity accompanied by a jump in the superconducting phase difference between the two superconductors. A standard model of these Josephson junctions, which can be fabricated to have a nearly perfect interfacial transparency, predicts a simple universal behavior. In that model, at the same value of Zeeman field for the topological transition, there is a $\pi$ phase jump and a minimum in the critical superconducting current, while applying a controllable phase difference yields a diamond-shaped topological region as a function of that phase difference and a Zeeman field. In contrast, even for a perfect interfacial transparency, we find a much richer and nonuniversal behavior as the width of the superconductor is varied or the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is considered. The Zeeman field for the phase jump, not necessarily $\pi$, is different from the value for the minimum critical current, while there is a strong deviation from the diamond-like topological region. These Josephson junctions show a striking example of a nonreciprocal transport and superconducting diode effect, revealing the importance of our findings not only for topological superconductivity and fault-tolerant quantum computing, but also for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Electronic Wigner-Molecule Polymeric Chains in Elongated Silicon Quantum Dots and Finite-Length Quantum Wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral properties of electrons confined in a wire-like quasi-one-dimensional (1D) elongated quantum dot (EQD) coupler between silicon qubits, are investigated with a newly developed valley-augmented unrestricted Hartree-Fock (va-UHF) method, generalized to include the valley degree of freedom treated as an isospin, allowing calculations for a large number of electrons. The lower energy symmetry-broken solutions of the self-consistent generalized Pople-Nesbet equations exhibit, for a confinement that has been modeled after an experimentally fabricated one in silicon, formation of Wigner-molecular polymeric (longitudinal) chains, initiating through charge accumulation at the edges of the finite-length quasi-1D wire. An increasing number of parallel zig-zag chains form as the number of electrons loaded into the confinement is increased, with the formation of newly added chains determined by the strength of the transverse harmonic confinement. The broken-symmetry va-UHF solutions, subsequently augmented by the quantum-mechanically required parity-restoration, go beyond the va-UHF single-determinant solution, predicting formation of entangled Wigner-molecular chains whose charge distributions obliterate the zig-zag organization of the broken-symmetry solutions. The symmetry-restored va-UHF methodology enables systematic investigations of multi-electron complex nano-scale confined structures that could be targeted for future imaging microscopy experiments in silicon and other materials (e.g., 1D domain walls in TMD materials), and quantum information utilization.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the near-field radiative heat transfer between a normally and/or laterally shifted nanoparticle and a planar fused silica slab coated with a strip graphene grating. For this study we develop and use a scattering matrix approach derived from Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions. We find that adding a graphene sheet coating on the slab can already enhance the heat flux by about 85%. We show that by patterning the graphene sheet coating into a grating, the heat flux is further increased, and this happens thanks to the a topological transition of the plasmonic modes from circular to hyperbolic one, which allows for more energy transfer. The lateral shift affects the accessible range of high-$k$ modes and thus affects the heat flux, too. By moving the nanoparticle laterally above the graphene grating, we can obtain an optimal heat flux with strong chemical potential dependance above the strips. For a fixed graphene grating period ($D=1\mu$m) and not too large normal shift (separation $d&lt;800$nm), two different types of lateral shift effects (e.g., enhancement and inhibition) on heat transfer have been observed. As the separation $d$ is further increased, the lateral shift effect becomes less important. We show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$. Two distinct asymptotic regimes are proposed: (1) the inhibition regime ($d/D&lt;0.85$), where the lateral shift reduces the heat transfer, and (2) the neutral regime ($d/D \geq 0.85$) where the effect of the lateral shift is negligible. In general, we can say that the geometric factor $d/D \approx 0.85$ is a critical point for the lateral shift effect. Our predictions can have relevant implications to the radiative heat transfer and energy management at the nano/micro scale.</description>

      <title>Control of spin-wave polarity and velocity using a ferrimagnetic domain wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the scattering of spin waves by a domain wall (DW) in a ferrimagnetic (FiM) spin chain in which two sublattices carry spins of unequal magnitudes. We find that a narrow, but atomically smooth FiM DW exhibits a different behavior in comparison with similarly smooth ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic DWs due to the inequivalence of the two sublattices. Specifically, for sufficiently weak anisotropy, the smaller spin at the center of the DW is found to become precisely normal to the easy-axis, selecting an arbitrary direction in the $xy$-plane and thereby breaking the U(1) spin-rotational symmetry spontaneously. This particular form of a FiM DW does not occur in antiferromagnetic systems and is shown to lead to a strong dependence of spin wave scattering pattern on the state of polarization of the spin wave, which can be either right-handed or left-handed, suggesting the utilization of such a narrow DW as a spin-wave filter. Moreover, we find that in the case of an atomically sharp DW, where all the spins point either up or down due to strong easy-axis anisotropy and therefore the polarization of the spin wave is conserved upon transmission, the wave vector of the spin wave changes after passing through the DW leading to a change in the group velocity of the spin wave. This change of the wave vector indicates the acceleration or deceleration of the spin waves and thus a sharp FiM DW could serve as a spin wave accelerator or decelerator in spintronics devices, offering a functionality absent in a ferromagnetic and an antiferromagnetic counterpart. Our results indicate that FiM spin textures can interact with spin waves distinctly from ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts, suggesting that they may offer spin-wave functionalities that are absent in more conventional magnets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the magnetic responses of bilayer graphene from the perspective of the quantum distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of the quantum geometry on the magnetic responses of quadratic band crossing semimetals. More explicitly, we examine the Landau levels, quantum Hall effect, and magnetic susceptibility of a general two-band Hamiltonian that has fixed isotropic quadratic band dispersion but with tunable quantum geometry, in which the interband coupling is fully characterized by the maximum quantum distance $d_\mathrm{max}$. By continuously tuning $d_\mathrm{max}$ in the range of $0\leq d_\mathrm{max}\leq 1$, we investigate how the magnetic properties of the free electron model with $d_\mathrm{max}=0$ evolve into those of the bilayer graphene with $d_\mathrm{max}=1$. We demonstrate that despite sharing the same energy dispersion $\epsilon(p) =\pm\frac{p^2}{2m}$, the charge carriers in the free electron model and bilayer graphene exhibit entirely distinct Landau levels and quantum Hall responses due to the nontrivial quantum geometry of the wave functions.</description>

      <title>Steady-state dynamics and non-local correlations in thermoelectric Cooper pair splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on Cooper pair splitters using superconductor-quantum dot hybrids have embarked on creating entanglement in the solid-state, by engineering the sub-gap processes in the superconducting region. Using the thermoelectric Cooper pair splitter setup [Nat. Comm., 12, 21, (2021)] as a prototype, we develop a detailed analysis of the observed transport signal to bring out vital insights into the regimes of operation and establish the non-local nature of the correlations arising from the crossed Andreev processes. As a striking consequence, contact induced level broadening of the quantum dot's discrete energy spectrum and its hybridization with the superconducting segment, results in a parity reversal of the thermoelectric current along with shifted resonances of the crossed Andreev processes. We conclusively establish the presence of non-local correlations by making a clear nexus with quantum discord. Our detailed analysis thereby provides insights into the gate voltage control of the entanglement generation in superconducting-hybrid Cooper pair splitters.</description>

      <title>Resilient Growth of Highly Crystalline Topological Insulator-Superconductor Heterostructure Enabled by Ex-situ Nitride Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly crystalline and easily feasible topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) heterostructures are crucial for the development of practical topological qubit devices. The optimal superconducting layer for TI-SC heterostructures should be highly resilient against external contaminations and structurally compatible with TIs. In this study, we provide a solution to this challenge by showcasing the growth of a highly crystalline TI-SC heterostructure using refractory TiN (111) as the superconducting layer. This approach can eliminate the need for in-situ cleaving or growth. More importantly, the TiN surface shows high resilience against contaminations during air exposure, as demonstrated by the successful recyclable growth of Bi2Se3. Our findings indicate that TI-SC heterostructures based on nitride films are compatible with device fabrication techniques, paving a path to the realization of practical topological qubit devices in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-equilibrium transport through interacting superconducting nanojunctions using a Liouville space approach. The formalism allows us to study finite gap effects, and to account for both quasiparticle and Cooper pair tunneling. With focus on the weak tunneling limit, we study the stationary dc and ac current up to second order (cotunneling) in the hybridization energy. We identify the characteristic virtual processes that yield the Andreev and Josephson current and obtain the dependence on the gate and bias voltage for the dc current, the critical current and the phase-dependent dissipative current. In particular, the critical current is characterized by regions in the stability diagram in which its sign changes from positive to negative, resulting in a multitude of 0-\pi transitions. The latter signal the interplay between strong interactions and tunneling at finite bias.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinear dynamics in periodically driven time crystal: from synchronized to chaotic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled electron-nuclear spin system in an InGaAs semiconductor as testbed of nonlinear dynamics can develop auto-oscillations, resembling time-crystalline behavior, when continuously excited by a circularly polarized laser. We expose this system to deviations from continuous driving by periodic modulation of the excitation polarization, revealing a plethora of nonlinear phenomena that depend on modulation frequency and depth. We find ranges in which the system's oscillations are entrained with the modulation frequency. The width of these ranges depends on the polarization modulation depth, resulting in an Arnold tongue. Outside the tongue, the system shows a variety of fractional subharmonic responses connected through bifurcation jets when varying the modulation frequency. Here, each branch in the frequency spectrum forms a devil's staircase. When an entrainment range is approached by going through an increasing order of bifurcations, chaotic behavior emerges. These findings can be described by an advanced model of the periodically pumped electron-nuclear spin system. We discuss the connection of the obtained results to different phases of time matter.</description>

      <title>Theory of phonon sidebands in the absorption spectra of moir\'e exciton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides have strongly modified dispersion relations due to the formation of periodic moir\'e potentials. The strong coupling to a light field in an optical cavity leads to the appearance of moir\'e polaritons. In this paper, we derive a theoretical model for the linear absorption spectrum of the coupled moir\'e polariton-phonon system based on the time-convolutionless (TCL) approach. Results obtained by numerically solving the TCL equation are compared to those obtained in the Markovian limit and from a perturbative treatment of non-Markovian corrections. A key quantity for the interpretation of the findings is the generalized phonon spectral density. We discuss the phonon impact on the spectrum for realistic moir\'e exciton dispersions by varying twist angle and temperature.
  Key features introduced by the coupling to phonons are broadenings and energy shifts of the upper and lower polariton peak and the appearance of phonon sidebands between them. We analyze these features with respect to the role of Markovian and non-Markovian effects and find that they strongly depend on the twist angle. We can distinguish between the regimes of large, small, and intermediate twist angles. In the latter phonon effects are particularly pronounced due to dominating phonon transitions into regions which are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states.</description>

      <title>Spatial dependence of local density of states in semiconductor-superconductor hybrids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana bound states are expected to appear in one-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor hybrid systems, provided they are homogenous enough to host a global topological phase. In order to experimentally investigate the uniformity of the system, we study the spatial dependence of the local density of states in multiprobe devices where several local tunnelling probes are positioned along a gate-defined wire in a two-dimensional electron gas. Spectroscopy at each probe reveals a hard induced gap, and an absence of subgap states at zero magnetic field. However, subgap states emerging at finite magnetic field are not always correlated between different probes. Moreover, we find that the extracted critical field and effective $g$-factor of the lowest energy subgap state varies significantly across the length of the wire. Upon studying several such devices we do however find examples of striking correlations in the local density of states measured at different tunnel probes. We discuss possible sources of variations across devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong charge-photon coupling allows the coherent coupling of a charge qubit, realized by a single charge carrier (either an electron or a hole) in a double quantum dot, to photons of a microwave resonator. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, in the dispersive regime, the photons can mediate both an $i$SWAP gate as well as a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate between two distant charge qubits. We provide a thorough discussion of the impact of the dominant noise sources, resonator damping and charge qubit dephasing on the average gate fidelity. Assuming a state-of-the art resonator decay rate and charge qubit dephasing rate, the predicted average gate fidelities are below 90%. However, an increase of the charge qubit dephasing rate by one order of magnitude is conjectured to result in gate fidelities surpassing 95%.</description>

      <title>Topologically tunable polaritons based on two-dimensional crystals in a photonic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonics is an emergent research discipline which interlinks fundamental aspects of photonics, information processing and solid-state physics. Exciton-polaritons are a specifically interesting platform to study topological phenomena, since the coherent light matter coupling enables new degrees of freedom such as tunable non-linearities, chiralities and dissipation. Room-temperature operation of such exciton-polaritons relies on materials comprising both, large exciton binding energies and oscillator strength. We harness widely spectrally tunable, room temperature exciton-polaritons based on a WS2 monolayer in an open optical cavity to realize a polariton potential landscape which emulates the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian. It comprises a domain boundary hosting a topological, exponentially localized mode at the interface between two lattices characterized by different Zak-phases which features a spectral tunability over a range as large as 80 meV. Moreover, we utilize the unique tilt-tunability of our implementation, to transform the SSH-lattice into a Stark-ladder. This transformation couples the topologically protected defect mode to propagating lattice modes, and effectively changes the symmetry of the system. Furthermore, it allows us to directly quantify the Zak-phase difference $\Delta_{Zak}=(1.13\pm 0.11)\pi$ between the two topological phases. Our work comprises an important step towards in-situ tuning topological lattices to control and guide light on non-linear chips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative characterization of two-dimensional locality (necessary e.g. to define the Hall conductivity of a Fermi projection) using the spectral projections of the Laughlin flux operator. Using this abstract characterization, we define generalizations of this locality, which we term quasi-2D. We go on to calculate the path-connected components of spaces of unitaries or orthogonal projections which are quasi-2D-local and find a starkly different behavior compared with the actual 2D column of the Kitaev table, exhibiting e.g., in the unitary chiral case, infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}$-valued indices.</description>

      <title>Engineering 2D square lattice Hubbard models in 90$^\circ$ twisted Ge/SnX (X=S, Se) moir\'e supperlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the large-period superlattices emerging in moir\'e two-dimensional (2D) materials, electronic states in such systems exhibit low energy flat bands that can be used to simulate strongly correlated physics in a highly tunable setup. While many investigations have thus far focused on moir\'e flat bands and emergent correlated electron physics in triangular, honeycomb and quasi-one-dimensional lattices, tunable moir\'e realizations of square lattices subject to strong correlations remain elusive. Here we propose a feasible scheme to construct moire square lattice systems by twisting two layers of 2D materials in a rectangular lattice by 90 degrees. We demonstrate such scheme with twisted Ge/SnX (X=S,Se) moir\'e superlattices and theoretical calculate their electronic structures from first principles. We show that the lowest conduction flat band in these systems can be described by a square lattice Hubbard model with parameters which can be controlled by varying the choice of host materials, number of layers, and external electric fields. In particular, twisted double bilayer GeSe realizes a square lattice Hubbard model with strong frustration due to the next nearest neighbour hopping that could lead to unconventional superconductivity, in close analogy to the Hubbard model for copper-oxygen planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The basic concept of using 90-degree twisted 2D materials with rectangular unit cell to realize the square lattice Hubbard model works in general and therefore we establish those systems as tunable platforms to simulate correlation physics in such a geometries.</description>

      <title>Chern insulator phase realized in dual-gate-tuned MnBi2Te4 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic order, large topological-magnetic gap and rich topological phases make MnBi2Te4 a wonderful platform to study exotic topological quantum states such as axion insulator and Chern insulator. To realize and manipulate these topological phases in a MnBi2Te4 thin film, precise manipulation of the electric field across the film is essential, which requires a dual-gate structure. In this work, we achieve dual-gate tuning of MnBi2Te4 thin films grown with molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(111) substrates by applying the substrate and an AlOx layer as the gate dielectrics of bottom and top gates, respectively. Under magnetic field of 9T and temperature of 20 mK, the Hall and longitudinal resistivities of the films show inversed gate-voltage dependence, for both top- and bottom-gates, signifying the existence of the dissipationless edge state contributed by Chern insulator phase in the ferromagnetic configuration. The maximum of the Hall resistivity only reaches 0.8 h/e2, even with dual-gate tuning, probably due to the high density of bulk carriers introduced by secondary phases. In the antiferromagnetic state under zero magnetic field, the films show normal insulator behavior. The dual-gated MnBi2Te4 thin films lay the foundation for developing devices based on electrically tunable topological quantum states.</description>

      <title>Visualizing uniform lattice-scale pair density wave in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional paring interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Good plasmons in a bad metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated materials may exhibit unusually high resistivity increasing linearly in temperature, breaking through the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound, above which coherent quasiparticles are destroyed. The fate of collective charge excitations, or plasmons, in these systems is a subject of debate. Several studies suggest plasmons are overdamped while others detect unrenormalized plasmons. Here, we present direct optical images of low-loss hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) in the correlated van der Waals metal MoOCl2. HPPs are plasmon-photon modes that waveguide through extremely anisotropic media and are remarkably long-lived in MoOCl2. Many-body theory supported by photoemission results reveals that MoOCl2 is in an orbital-selective and highly incoherent Peierls phase. Different orbitals acquire markedly different bonding-antibonding character, producing a highly-anisotropic, isolated Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is further reconstructed and made partly incoherent by electronic interactions, renormalizing the plasma frequency. HPPs remain long-lived in spite of this, allowing us to uncover previously unseen imprints of electronic correlations on plasmonic collective modes.</description>

      <title>Hybrid terahertz emitter for pulse shaping and chirality control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation, spanning from 0.3 to 3x10^12 Hz, fills the crucial gap between the microwave and infrared spectral range. THz technology has found applications in various fields, from imaging and sensing to telecommunication and biosensing. However, the full potential of these applications is often hindered by the need for precise control and manipulation of the frequency and polarization state, which typically requires external THz modulators. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid THz source that overcomes this limitation. Our device consists of two THz emitters integrated into one single device, enabling pulse shaping and chirality control of the emitted radiation without additional external components. The two sources are a spintronic emitter and a semiconductor photoconductive antenna (PCA). Using a combination of dual-wavelength excitation, allowing for control of the relative time delay between the two laser excitation pulses, and tuning external parameters for each emitter (i.e., biasing voltage for the PCA and magnetic field for the spintronic THz emitter) enables precise control of the mixing of the two signals and results in frequency, polarization, and chirality control of the overall THz radiation. This on-chip hybrid emitter provides an essential platform for engineered THz radiation with wide-ranging potential applications.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound Estimate of the Electronic Scattering Potential of a Weakly Interacting Molecular Film on a Metal</title>

Abstract: Thin organic films and two-dimensional (2D) molecular assemblies on solid surfaces yield the potential for applications in molecular electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, and sensing. These applications rely on the intrinsic electronic properties of the hybrid organic/inorganic interface. Here, we investigate the energy dispersion of 2D electronic states at the interface between an atomically thin self-assembled molecular film, comprised of flat, noncovalently bonded 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules, and a Ag(111) surface. Using Fourier-transformed scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS), we determined that the 2D electronic wave functions with wavevectors within ~80% of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) area close to the Gamma-point are free-electron-like, suggesting a weak electronic interaction between the 2D molecular film and the metal surface. Via a perturbative second-order correction to the free electron energy dispersion, we further established an upper bound for the amplitude of the scattering potential resulting from the self-assembled molecular film that the interface electrons are subject to, on the order of 1.5 eV. Our approach allows for quantifying electronic interactions at hybrid 2D interfaces and heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Considering the role of electron correlation in a two-dimensional (2D) system in strong magnetic field, we investigate the quantum states of two interacting electrons in the quantum Hall effect regime. We introduce sub-Landau levels of the two-electron states by determining their energies and degeneracies. The effects of electron correlation, Zeeman splitting and energy-level broadening on the stability of the electron-pair states are discussed. It is shown that the two electrons in the triplet state with spins aligned parallel to the magnetic field can form a stable electron pair in the 2D system in GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction. A wavefunction of many electron pairs are presented and compared with the Laughlin wavefunction.</description>

Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

Abstract: We use Boltzmann theory to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to $g^{xy}$ component of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a quantum dot is coupled to a topological superconductor via tunneling contacts, each contact hosts a Majorana zero mode in the limit of zero transmission. Close to a resonance and at a finite contact transparency, the resonant level in the quantum dot couples the Majorana modes, but a ground state degeneracy per fermion parity subspace remains if the number of Majorana modes coupled to the dot is five or larger. Upon varying shape-defining gate voltages while remaining close to resonance, a nontrivial evolution within the degenerate ground-state manifold is achieved. We characterize the corresponding non-Abelian holonomy for a quantum dot with chaotic classical dynamics using random matrix theory and discuss measurable signatures of the non-Abelian time-evolution.</description>

Abstract: Magnetism in two-dimensional materials reveals phenomena distinct from bulk magnetic crystals, with sensitivity to charge doping and electric fields in monolayer and bilayer van der Waals magnet CrI3. Within the class of layered magnets, semiconducting CrSBr stands out by featuring stability under ambient conditions, correlating excitons with magnetic order and thus providing strong magnon-exciton coupling, and exhibiting peculiar magneto-optics of exciton-polaritons. Here, we demonstrate that both exciton and magnetic transitions in bilayer and trilayer CrSBr are sensitive to voltage-controlled field-effect charging, exhibiting bound exciton-charge complexes and doping-induced metamagnetic transitions. Moreover, we demonstrate how these unique properties enable optical probes of local magnetic order, visualizing magnetic domains of competing phases across metamagnetic transitions induced by magnetic field or electrostatic doping. Our work identifies few-layer CrSBr as a rich platform for exploring collaborative effects of charge, optical excitations, and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Phonon Induced Anomalous Hall Effect in 2D Massive Dirac metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon induced anomalous Hall or thermal Hall effects have been observed in various systems in recent experiments. However, the theoretical studies on this subject are very scarce and incomplete. In this work, we present a systematic quantum field theory study on the phonon induced anomalous Hall effect, including both the side jump and skew scattering contributions, in a 2D massive Dirac metal, which is considered as the minimum anomalous Hall system. We reveal significant difference from the anomalous Hall effect induced by the widely studied Gaussian disorder which is known to be insensitive to temperature. While the anomalous Hall effect induced by phonon approaches that by Gaussian disorder at high temperature, it behaves very differently at low temperature. Our work provides a microscopic and quantitative description of the crossover from the low to high temperature regime of the phonon induced anomalous Hall conductivity, which may be observed in 2D Dirac metals with breaking time reversal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Separating heat from charge in a material is an extremely challenging task since they are transported by the very same carriers, i.e. electrons or holes. In this Letter we show that such separation can reach 100% efficiency in a hybrid superconducting quantum Hall setup, provided that the quantum Hall system is tuned to integer filling factor. We present microscopic calculations for a three-terminal setup to illustrate our idea.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Role of many phonon modes on the high-temperature linear-in-$T$ electronic resistivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically consider the possibility that phonons may be playing a role in the observed linear-in-$T$ resistivity in cuprates by focusing on the obvious question: How can phonon scattering be consistent with a linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a constant slope given that cuprates have many phonon modes with different energies and electron-phonon couplings (e.g. 21 phonon modes for LSCO)? We show using an arbitrarily large number of independent phonon modes that, within a model Boltzmann transport theory, the emergent high-$T$ linear-in-$T$ resistivity manifests an approximately constant slope independent of the number of phonon modes except in some fine-tuned narrow temperature regimes. We also comment on the quantitative magnitude of the linear-in-$T$ resistivity in cuprates pointing out the constraints on the effective electron-phonon coupling necessary to produce the observed resistivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of a circular graphene nanoribbon (carbon belt) in a magnetic field parallel to its central axis is studied using a tight-binding model. Orbital magnetic susceptibility is calculated using an analytical expression of the energy eigenvalues as a function of the magnetic flux density for any size, and its temperature dependence is considered. In the absence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the orbital magnetic susceptibility diverges at absolute zero if the chemical potential is zero and the number of atoms is a multiple of four. As the temperature increases, the magnitude of susceptibility decreases according to the power law, whose exponent depends on the size. In the presence of electron hopping parallel to the magnetic field, the divergence of the susceptibility near absolute zero disappears, and the sign changes with the transfer integral parallel to the magnetic field and the temperature.</description>

      <title>Twisted MoSe2 Homobilayer Behaving as a Heterobilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterostructures (HSs) formed by the transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) materials have shown great promise in next-generation optoelectronic and photonic applications. An artificially twisted HS, allows us to manipulate the optical, and electronic properties. With this work, we introduce the understanding of the complex energy transfer (ET) process governed by the dipolar interaction in a twisted molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) homobilayer without any charge-blocking interlayer. We fabricated an unconventional homobilayer (i.e., HS) with a large twist angle by combining the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and mechanical exfoliation (Exf.) techniques to fully exploit the lattice parameters mismatch and indirect/direct (CVD/Exf.) bandgap nature. This effectively weaken the charge transfer (CT) process and allows the ET process to take over the carrier recombination channels. We utilize a series of optical and electron spectroscopy techniques complementing by the density functional theory calculations, to describe a massive photoluminescence enhancement from the HS area due to an efficient ET process. Our results show that the electronically decoupled MoSe2 homobilayer is coupled by the ET process, mimicking a 'true' heterobilayer nature.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e systems featuring flat electronic bands exhibit a vast landscape of emergent exotic quantum states, making them one of the resourceful platforms in condensed matter physics in recent times. Tuning these systems via twist angle and the electric field greatly enhances our comprehension of their strongly correlated ground states. Here, we report a technique to investigate the nuanced intricacies of band structures in dual-gated multilayer graphene systems. We utilize the Landau levels of a decoupled monolayer graphene to extract the electric field-dependent bilayer graphene charge neutrality point gap. Then, we extend this method to analyze the evolution of the band gap and the flat bandwidth in twisted mono-bilayer graphene. The band gap maximizes at the same displacement field where the flat bandwidth minimizes, indicating the strongest electron-electron correlation, which is supported by directly observing the emergence of a strongly correlated phase. Moreover, we extract integer and fractional gaps to further demonstrate the strength of this method. Our technique gives a new perspective and paves the way for improving the understanding of electronic band structure in versatile flat band systems.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a computational analysis of a superconducting transmon qubit design, in which the superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) Josephson junction is replaced by a co-planar, superconductor-constriction-superconductor (ScS) nanobridge junction. Within the scope of Ginzburg-Landau theory, we find that the nanobridge ScS transmon has an improved charge dispersion compared to the SIS transmon, with a tradeoff of smaller anharmonicity. These calculations provide a framework for estimating the superconductor material properties and junction dimensions compatible with gigahertz frequency ScS transmon operation.</description>

      <title>Observation of terahertz second harmonic generation from Dirac surface states in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of second harmonic generation with high conversion efficiency $\sim 0.005\%$ in the terahertz regime from thin films of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ that exhibit the linear photogalvanic effect, measured via time-domain terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz emission, respectively. As neither phenomena is observable from topologically trivial In-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and since no enhancement is observed when subject to band bending, the efficient thickness-independent nonliear responses are attributable to the Dirac fermions of topological surface states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. This observation of intrinsic terahertz second harmonic generation in an equilibrium system unlocks the full suite of both even and odd harmonic orders in the terahertz regime and opens new pathways to probing quantum geometry via intraband nonlinear processes. We hope our work will motivate the theoretical development of a full treatment of second harmonic generation for probing the quantum geometry in various inversion-breaking topological and twisted materials.</description>

Abstract: Lattice symmetries are central to the characterization of electronic topology. Recently, it was shown that Green's function eigenvectors form a representation of the space group. This formulation has allowed the identification of gapless topological states even when quasiparticles are absent. Here we demonstrate the profundity of the framework in the extreme case, when interactions lead to a Mott insulator, through a solvable model with long-range interactions. We find that both Mott poles and zeros are subject to the symmetry constraints, and relate the symmetry-enforced spectral crossings to degeneracies of the original non-interacting eigenstates. Our results lead to new understandings of topological quantum materials and highlight the utility of interacting Green's functions toward their symmetry-based design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation has the potential to be an indispensable technique for the investigation of non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum field theories (QFTs). In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum~(NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on the horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be solved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum machines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a large family of strongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs. The latter exhibit a wide-range of non-perturbative effects like `quark confinement' and `false vacuum decay' which are typically associated with higher-dimensional QFTs of elementary particles. We perform quench experiments on IBM's ibmq_mumbai quantum simulator to compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal field. The latter model is particularly interesting due to the formation of mesonic bound states arising from a confining potential for the Ising domain-walls, reminiscent of t'Hooft's model of two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics. Our results demonstrate that digital quantum simulation in the NISQ era has the potential to be a viable alternative to numerical techniques such as density matrix renormalization group or the truncated conformal space methods for analyzing QFTs.</description>

      <title>Conformal field theory approach to parton fractional quantum Hall trial wave functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that all lowest Landau level projected and unprojected chiral parton type fractional quantum Hall ground and edge state trial wave functions, which take the form of products of integer quantum Hall wave functions, can be expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlation functions, where we can associate a chiral algebra to each parton state such that the CFT defined by the algebra is the ``smallest'' such CFT that can generate the corresponding ground and edge state trial wave functions. A field-theoretic generalisation of Laughlin's plasma analogy, known as generalised screening, is formulated for these states. If this holds, we argue that the inner products of edge state trial wave functions, for parton states where the ``densest'' trial wave function is unique, can be expressed as matrix elements of an exponentiated local action operator of the CFT, generalising the result of Dubail et al. [PRB 85, 11531 (2012)], which implies the equality between edge state and entanglement level counting to state counting in the corresponding CFT. We numerically test this result in two specific cases. We discuss how Read's arguments [PRB 79, 045308 (2009)] still apply, implying that conformal blocks of the CFT defined by the corresponding chiral algebra are valid quasi-hole trial wave functions, with the adiabatic braiding statistics given by the monodromy of these functions, assuming the existence of a quasi-particle trapping Hamiltonian. Generalisations of these constructions are discussed. It is shown that all chiral composite fermion wave functions can be expressed as CFT correlation functions without explicit symmetrisation or anti-symmetrisation and that the ground, edge, and certain quasi-hole trial wave functions of the $\phi_n^m$ parton states can be expressed as the conformal blocks of the $U(1) \otimes SU(n)_m$ WZW models.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary time - an exact scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. The formulation we use makes it clear that Schmid's superconducting - insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ is forbidden already at the qualitative level. This confirms theoretically a similar conclusion based on experimental observations drawn in 2020 by Murani et al. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We reveal that the UV cutoff of the resistor plays an unforeseen key role in these systems, and show that the erroneous prediction of an insulating state resulted from ill-assuming it would not.</description>

Abstract: Geometric fluctuations of the density mode in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state can give rise to a nematic FQH phase, a topological state with a spontaneously broken rotational symmetry. While experiments on FQH states in the second Landau level have reported signatures of putative FQH nematics in anisotropic transport, a realistic model for this state has been lacking. We show that the standard model of particles in the lowest Landau level interacting via the Coulomb potential realizes the FQH nematic transition, which is reached by a progressive reduction of the strength of the shortest-range Haldane pseudopotential. Using exact diagonalization and variational wave functions, we demonstrate that the FQH nematic transition occurs when the system's neutral gap closes in the long-wavelength limit while the charge gap remains open. We confirm the symmetry-breaking nature of the transition by demonstrating the existence of a "circular moat" potential in the manifold of states with broken rotational symmetry, while its geometric character is revealed through the strong fluctuations of the nematic susceptibility and Hall viscosity.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions in Kitaev chains side-coupled to normal metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02266</link>

Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a normal metal (NM) side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant used to characterize topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Efficient semiclassical approximation for bound states in graphene in magnetic field with a small trigonal warping correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of semiclassical spectrum and efficient (simple to implement) explicit semiclassical asymptotic eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator for relatively high-energy bound states in graphene in magnetic field, considering the effect of trigonal warping [11, 16] to be small. It turns out that the asymptotic spectrum of the operator remains unchanged under such a perturbation due to the symmetry of the problem rather than the smallness of this correction. However, the behavior of asymptotic eigenfunctions is quite different; they are significantly affected by trigonal warping that leads to the breaking of certain symmetries. Density plots of asymptotic eigenfunctions can indicate what might be observed using a scanning tunneling microscope. Our approach to constructing asymptotic solutions is based on developments of works [9, 1, 5], which present a new method for constructing the solution, simplifying practical application.</description>
