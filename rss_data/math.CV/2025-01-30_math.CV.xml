      <title>Dirac delta as a generalized holomorphic function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of a non-trivial space of generalized functions of a complex variable allowing to consider derivatives of continuous functions is a non-obvious task, e.g. because of Morera theorem, because distributional Cauchy-Riemann equations implies holomorphicity and of course because including Dirac delta seems incompatible with the identity theorem. Surprisingly , these results can be achieved if we consider a suitable non-Archimedean extension of the complex field, i.e. a ring where infinitesimal and infinite numbers return to be available. In this first paper, we set the definition of generalized holomorphic function and prove the extension of several classical theorems, such as Cauchy-Riemann equations, Goursat, Looman-Menchoff and Montel theorems, generalized differentiability implies smoothness, intrinsic embedding of compactly supported distributions, closure with respect to composition and hence non-linear operations on these generalized functions. The theory hence addresses several limitations of Colombeau theory of generalized holomorphic functions. The final aim of this series of papers is to prove the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem including also distributional PDE or singular boundary conditions and nonlinear operations.</description>

      <title>Certain real surfaces in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.04085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under certain geometric condition, the surfaces in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with isolated CR singularity at the origin and with cubic lowest degree homogeneous term in its graph near the origin, can be reduced, up to biholomorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$, to a one parameter family of the form \[ M_t:=\left\{(z,w)\in\mathbb{C}^2: w=z^2\overline{z}+tz\overline{z}^2+\dfrac{t^2}{3} \overline{z}^3+o(|z|^3)\right\},\;\; t\in (0,\infty) \] near the origin. We prove that $M_t$ is not locally polynomially convex if $t&lt;1$. The local hull contains a ball centred at the origin if $t&lt;\sqrt{3}/2$. We also prove that $M_t$ is locally polynomially convex for $t\geq\sqrt{\dfrac{3}{2}}$. We show that, for $\sqrt{3}/2\leq t&lt;1$, the polynomial hull of $M_t\cap \overline{B(0;\delta)}$ contains a one parameter family of analytic discs passing through the origin for every $\delta&gt;0$. We also prove that, if we remove the higher order terms from the graphing function of $M_t$, it is locally polynomially convex for $t\geq\dfrac{\sqrt{15-\sqrt{33}}}{2\sqrt{2}}$. Some new results about the local polynomial convexity of the union of three totally-real planes are also reported.</description>

      <title>Modulus estimates of semirings with applications to boundary extension problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper [GSV2020], we proved that the complementary components of a ring domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with large enough modulus may be separated by an annular ring domain and applied this result to boundary correspondence problems under quasiconformal mappings. In the present paper, we continue this work and investigate boundary extension problems for a larger class of mappings.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of nondegenerate hypo-analytic structures of hypersurface type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth, non-degenerate locally integrable structure of hypersurface type on a manifold $M$, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be equivalent, near a point, to a real-analytic locally integrable structure (the analytic regularizability), generalizing a recent result of Zaitsev and the first author.
  First, we discover, in our setting, a (previously unknown) invariant CR submanifold $\Sigma$ in $M$ of hypersurface type, which we call the central submanifold. We prove that the analytic regularizability of $M$ is equivalent to that of the associated CR manifold $\Sigma$. Furthermore, as a byproduct of our construction, we show that the central manifold construction reduces the whole (smooth or analytic) equivalence problem for nondegenerate structures with the Levi positivity condition to that of the associated central manifolds, i.e. to CR geometry.
  Second, we make use of a classical construction due to Marson and show that sufficient for the analytic regularizability of $M$ is the analytic regularizability of the CR manifold $\tilde M$ associated with $M$ in the sense of Marson.
  We show applications of both regularizability conditions to classes of locally integrable structures.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium of Charges and Differential Equations Solved by Polynomials II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue study of equilibrium of two species of 2d coulomb charges (or point vortices in 2d ideal fluid) started in (Igor Loutsenko, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 37, 1309, 2004). Although for two species of vortices with circulation ratio -1 the relationship between the equilibria and the factorization/Darboux transformation of the Schrodinger operator was established a long ago, the question about similar relationship for the ratio -2 remained unanswered. Here we present the answer: One has to consider Darboux-type transformations of third order differential operators rather than second order Schrodinger operators. Furthermore, we show that such transformations can also generate equilibrium configurations where an additional charge of a third specie is present. Relationship with integrable hierarchies is briefly discussed.</description>
