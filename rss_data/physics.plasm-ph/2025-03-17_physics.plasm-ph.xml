      <title>Operation above the Greenwald density limit in high performance DIII-D negative triangularity discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density limit in strongly-shaped negative triangularity (NT) discharges is studied experimentally in the DIII-D tokamak. Record-high Greenwald fractions $f_G$ are obtained, using gas puff injection only, with values up to near 2, where $f_G$ is defined as the ratio of the line-averaged density over $n_G=I_p/(\pi\,a^2)$, with $I_p$[MA] the plasma current and $a$[m] the plasma minor radius. A clear higher operational limit with higher auxiliary power is also demonstrated, with the ohmic density limit about two times lower than with additional neutral beam injection heating. The evolution of the electron density, temperature and pressure profiles are analyzed as well. The core density can be up to twice the Greenwald density and keeps increasing, while the value at the separatrix remains essentially constant and slightly below $n_G$. The edge temperature gradient collapses to near zero and NT plasmas are shown to be resilient to such profiles in terms of disruptivity. We also present the time evolution of the inverse electron pressure scale length with the value at the last closed flux surface (LCFS) decreasing below the value at the normalized radius 0.9 near the density limit, demonstrating the clear drop of confinement starting from the edge. This inverse scale length ``collapse'' at the LCFS also defines well the characteristic behavior of the kinetic profiles approaching a density limit.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning heat flux closure for multi-moment fluid modeling of nonlinear Landau damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear plasma physics problems are usually simulated through comprehensive modeling of phase space. The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models. However, a major challenge has been finding a suitable fluid closure for these fluid models. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator - a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning-assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Predictive study of non-axisymmetric neutral beam ion loss on the upgraded KSTAR plasma-facing components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate ion loss induced by neutral beam injection (NBI) in three-dimensional (3D) space with high fidelity on the plasma-facing components (PFCs) of the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) device. Utilizing a 3D collision detection routine added to the NuBDeC code and computer-aided design data reflecting the recent upgrade to a tungsten divertor, we have characterized 3D heat flux distribution and patterns over PFCs due to the NB ion loss throughout parameter scans. First, we identify axial asymmetry in the heat flux distribution. The plasma-wetted areas extend along the direction of the plasma current and deviate diagonally in the direction of the NB ion's poloidal turn. Additionally, on the PFC surfaces, local heat flux peaks are observed along both poloidal and toroidal directions. These local peaks emerge on the surfaces of the PFCs that protrude toward the regions swept by the NB ions. Second, through a case study of NB1-C (beam source C of neutral beam 1) that results in the most loss, we analyze several changes in the heat flux patterns observed on the divertor and the poloidal limiter. Such analysis allows us to examine how variations in the parameters affect the movement of the peak heat flux position and the extent of the plasma-wetted area, if formed. We observe that the ion loss increases under several conditions: shallower beam deposition, higher beam energy, larger poloidal beta, and lower plasma current. Ions born near the plasma edge due to shallow beam injection follow orbits with a larger minor radius. Flux surface shifts and ion drifts from changes in beam energy, poloidal beta, and plasma current move these orbits closer to the wall. These factors increase the chance of ion loss through wall collisions. This study is believed to help optimize design and operation of NBI systems.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the shock, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Heterodyne Microwave Interferometer for Plasma Density Measurements on the Madison AWAKE Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Madison AWAKE Prototype (MAP) is a high-power, high-density helicon plasma experiment. The project's main goal is to develop a scalable plasma source for use in a beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator as part of the AWAKE project. We measure the plasma density with a new heterodyne microwave interferometer that features several improvements over traditional approaches. The design uses a single microwave source combined with an upconverter to avoid frequency drift and reduce overall cost. Elliptical mirrors focus the probe beam into the plasma and guide it back to the receiver. The transmitter and receiver along with the measurement electronics are co-located in a small enclosure and are assisted by two small mirrors on the opposite side of MAP. Both halves of the system move independently on computer-controlled motion platforms. This setup enables fast repositioning of the interferometer to measure at any axial location despite the magnets, wiring and structural supports that would block movement of a waveguide-based system. A high-speed, high-precision mixed signal circuit and FPGA analyze the probe signal directly in the enclosure which obviates the need for a digitizer or oscilloscope. The interferometer resolves phase shifts down to one hundredth of a fringe, resulting in a line-averaged resolution of $1.5\mathrm{\cdot 10^{17}\; m^{-3}}$. The system provides a real-time measurement every $5\;\mathrm{\mu s}$ up into the mid $\mathrm{10^{19}\; m^{-3}}$ density range with a noise level of $1.0\mathrm{\cdot 10^{17}\; m^{-3}}$.</description>

      <title>Data-constrained 3D MHD Simulation of a Spiral Jet Caused by an Unstable Flux Rope Embedded in Fan-spine Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiral jets are impulsive plasma ejections that typically show an apparent rotation motion. Their generation, however, is still nont understood thoroughly. Based on a high-resolution vector magnetogram form the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager onboard Solar Orbiter, we constrcut a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) MHD model, aiming to disclose the eruption mechanism of a tiny spiral jet at a moss region observed on March 3 2022. The initial configuration of the simulation consists of an extrapolated coronal magnetic field based on the vector magnetogram and an inserted unstable flux rope constructed by the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws method. Our results highlight the critical role of the fan-spine configuration in forming the spiral jet and confirm the collapse of the pre-existing magnetic null to a curved 3D current sheet where external reconnection takes places. It is further disclosed that the flux rope quickly moves upward, reconnecting with the field lines near the outer spine, thereby enabling the transfer of twist and cool material from the flux rope to the open field, giving rise to the tiny spiral jet we observed. The notable similarities between these characteristics and those for larger-scale jets suggest that spiral jets, regardless of their scale, essentially share the same eruption mechanism.</description>

      <title>Electron Heating by Parallel Electric Fields in Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate electron heating by magnetic-field-aligned electric fields ($E_\parallel$) during anti-parallel magnetic reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail. Using a statistical sample of 140 reconnection outflows, we infer the acceleration potential associated with $E_\parallel$ from the shape of the electron velocity distribution functions. We show that heating by $E_\parallel$ in the reconnection outflow can reach up to ten times the inflow electron temperature. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the acceleration potential scales with the inflow Alfv\'en and electron thermal speeds to maintain quasi-neutrality in the reconnection region. Our results suggest that, as the inflow plasma parameter $\beta_{e\infty}$ increases, $E_\parallel$ becomes increasingly important to the ion-to-electron energy partition associated with magnetic reconnection.</description>
