      <title>Phases of the $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theory at large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $(2+1)$-dimensional $q$-deformed $\mathrm{SU}(N)_k$ Yang-Mills theory in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism, which is characterized by three parameters: the number of colors $N$, the coupling constant $g$, and the level $k$. By treating these as tunable parameters, we explore how key properties of the theory, such as confinement and topological order, emerge in different regimes. Employing a variational mean-field analysis that interpolates between the strong- and weak-coupling regimes, we determine the large-$N$ phase structure in terms of the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda_\mathrm{tH}=g^2N$ and the ratio $k/N$. We find that the topologically ordered phase remains robust at large $N$ under appropriate scalings of these parameters. This result indicates that the continuum limit of large-$N$ gauge theory may be more intricate than naively expected, and motivates studies beyond the mean-field theory, both to achieve a further understanding of confinement in gauge theories and to guide quantum simulations of large-$N$ gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Three-particle scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>

      <title>Addicted to Flavour: 1976-2026</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I describe my activities in Flavour Physics from 1976 to 2026. However, this 50th anniversary is not the only motivation for this writing. The second reason is the 350th anniversary of the discovery of the first animalcula by van Leeuvanhoek in 1676. Flavour physics makes it possible to search for new animalcula at distance scales far shorter than those resolved by van Leeuwenhoek in 1676 and even shorter than those directly accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. Achieving this goal requires not only precise measurements of a wide variety of processes, but also equally precise theoretical calculations, both within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond it. In this respect, next-to-leading-order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD calculations of various Wilson coefficients in the SM and beyond it, in which I was involved for two decades, as well as reliable treatments of non-perturbative QCD effects, are indispensable. Equally important is the proper choice of observables that are best suited to revealing these new animalcula of particle physics. Moreover, in my view it is crucial to develop strategies for the search for New Physics (NP) that go beyond the global fits that are very popular today. While effective field theories such as WET and SMEFT are formulated in terms of Wilson coefficients of the relevant operators, with correlations characteristic of the SM and of specific NP scenarios, the most direct tests of the SM and its extensions are, in my opinion, correlations among different observables that are characteristic of particular new animalcula at work. Numerous colourful plots in this article illustrate this point. I hope that these ideas are clearly conveyed in my Flavour Autobiography, which also includes my memories of many conferences, workshops, and schools, as well as related anecdotes that are not always directly connected to physics.</description>

      <title>Extracting scattering phase shift in quantum mechanics on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of extracting infinite volume scattering phase shift on quantum computers in a simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical model, using the formalism established in Ref.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc} that relates the integrated correlation functions (ICF) for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral. The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, if the integrated additional term $\chi=(g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4xL(x) $ is not zero, it is not integer nor gauge invariant, so that VNABI would not be allowed in QCD. Using the Wu-Yang arguments, it is however proved that $\chi$ becomes vanishing. $\chi$ is evaluated also in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). When the gradient flow method is used, the term $\chi$ tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ($\tau$). The bosonic definition of the topological charge $Q_t$ and its Abelian counterpart $Q_a\equiv (g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4x \Tr(f_{\mu\nu}f_{\mu\nu}^*)$ written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When $\chi$ is zero, $Q_a$=3$Q_t$ is expected theoretically.</description>

      <title>Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a mesoscopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident. The framework introduced here holds particular relevance for monolayer spintronics research, where the ultimate goal is to achieve a strong ferromagnetic order at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Roles of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore phase structures and hadron mass spectra in cold and dense two-color QCD with $2+2$ flavors where the sign problem disappears. We particularly focus on $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We employ an $N_f=2+2$ linear sigma model based on the $SU(8)$ Pauli-G\"{u}rsey symmetry to describe negative-parity as well as positive-parity hadrons, for which low-energy excitations are appropriately described particularly in the baryon superfluid phase with light diquark condensates. As a result, the strange chiral condensate is found to be enhanced in the superfluid phase owing to the flavor-mixing structure of $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. We also confirm this enhancement by means of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Besides, our present analysis predicts the existence of a novel superfluid phase where heavy diquarks condense in dense regime. The topological susceptibility with $2+2$ flavors from the viewpoints of the anomaly effects and chiral-symmetry restoration is investigated. Furthermore, we derive a complete inverse mass hierarchy for negative-parity diquarks with sufficient anomaly effects. Our findings are expected to provide future lattice simulations with useful information on flavor-symmetry violation from the $U(1)$ axial anomaly aspects in cold and dense two-color QCD medium.</description>
