      <title>Optimal Control of Lantana camara: An Entropy-Based Sustainable Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Framing control policies to mitigate the impact of invasive plants on indigenous biodiversity within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework is the primary objective of this work. Using reported ecological dynamics of the invasive species \textit{Lantana camara}, we develop a minimal three-species network model, where each node follows generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) dynamical equations. Employing Lie algebra and network control theory, we establish the model's controllability and accessibility criteria. Through nonlinear optimization programming, we derive sustainable policies for controlling abundances of \textit{Lantana camara}. We also have used Shannon entropy as an indicator to assess the sustainability of these optimal policies. The analysis of the sensitivity measured using this technique reveals that the control strategy is critically dependent on the ratio of the intrinsic growth rates of the \textit{Lantana camara} and the control plant. Thus, we get a modular algorithmic decision support mechanism for designing control policies to manage \textit{Lantana camara} abundances.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Graining Cascades Within Food Webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying population dynamics is a fundamental challenge in ecology and evolutionary biology, particularly for species that are cryptic, microscopic, or extinct. Traditional approaches rely on continuous representations of population size, but in many cases, the precise number of individuals is unknowable. Here, we present a coarse-grained population model that simplifies population dynamics to binary states - high or low - determined by the balance of bottom-up resource availability and top-down predation pressure. This Boolean framework provides a minimal yet analytically tractable alternative to traditional Lotka-Volterra-based models, enabling direct insights into the role of food web structure in shaping community stability. Using this approach, we investigate how trophic interactions influence population persistence, cyclic dynamics, and extinction risk across model food webs. We find that top-down effects are a primary driver of cycling, aligning with theoretical expectations from traditional population models, and that trophic position strongly influences extinction risk, with higher-trophic species more prone to persistent low-population states. Additionally, we explore the role of trophic short-circuits -- direct interactions between apex predators and low-trophic prey -- and find that they can buffer cascades and alter extinction patterns in ways that are often overlooked in classical models. By simplifying population dynamics to a two-state system, this framework provides a powerful tool for disentangling the structural drivers of community stability. These results highlight the potential of coarse-grained approaches to complement existing models, offering new insights into trophic interactions, extinction risks, and the susceptibility of species to trophic cascades.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation Theory of SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. Developing an evolutionary model capable of continuously integrating new experimental data is an urgent priority. By employing well-founded assumptions for mutant representation (four-letter and two-letter formats) and the n-mer distance algorithm, we constructed an evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that accurately reflects observed viral strain evolution. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X of x randomly generated sites on the spike protein. Our analysis reveals that the position of a generated strain on the tree is determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the proportions of macro-lineages shift: lineage O surpasses lineage N, lineage P overtakes O, and ultimately, new lineage Q surpasses P. We identified threshold values of x that distinguish between macro-lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear regression of the number of mutated sites (x) against sample collection dates (t) provides a robust approximation, enabling the prediction of new lineage emergence based on the x-t relationship. To conclude, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains on the evolutionary tree can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites; and the large-scale stochastic sampling uncovers evolutionary patterns governing the emergence of diverse macro-lineages.</description>

      <title>A reassessment of the "hard-steps" model for the evolution of intelligent life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the "hard-steps" model, the origin of humanity required "successful passage through a number of intermediate steps" (so-called "hard" or "critical" steps) that were intrinsically improbable with respect to the total time available for biological evolution on Earth. This model similarly predicts that technological life analogous to human life on Earth is "exceedingly rare" in the universe. Here, we critically reevaluate the core assumptions of the hard-steps model in light of recent advances in the Earth and life sciences. Specifically, we advance a potential alternative model where there are no hard steps, and evolutionary novelties (or singularities) required for human origins can be explained via mechanisms outside of intrinsic improbability. Furthermore, if Earth's surface environment was initially inhospitable not only to human life, but also to certain key intermediate steps in human evolution (e.g., the origin of eukaryotic cells, multicellular animals), then the "delay" in the appearance of humans can be best explained through the sequential opening of new global environmental windows of habitability over Earth history, with humanity arising relatively quickly once the right conditions were established. In this co-evolutionary (or geobiological) scenario, humans did not evolve "early" or "late" with respect to the total lifespan of the biosphere, but "on time."</description>

      <title>A Review of BioTree Construction in the Context of Information Fusion: Priors, Methods, Applications and Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04815</link>

Abstract: Biological tree (BioTree) analysis is a foundational tool in biology, enabling the exploration of evolutionary and differentiation relationships among organisms, genes, and cells. Traditional tree construction methods, while instrumental in early research, face significant challenges in handling the growing complexity and scale of modern biological data, particularly in integrating multimodal datasets. Advances in deep learning (DL) offer transformative opportunities by enabling the fusion of biological prior knowledge with data-driven models. These approaches address key limitations of traditional methods, facilitating the construction of more accurate and interpretable BioTrees. This review highlights critical biological priors essential for phylogenetic and differentiation tree analyses and explores strategies for integrating these priors into DL models to enhance accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, the review systematically examines commonly used data modalities and databases, offering a valuable resource for developing and evaluating multimodal fusion models. Traditional tree construction methods are critically assessed, focusing on their biological assumptions, technical limitations, and scalability issues. Recent advancements in DL-based tree generation methods are reviewed, emphasizing their innovative approaches to multimodal integration and prior knowledge incorporation. Finally, the review discusses diverse applications of BioTrees in various biological disciplines, from phylogenetics to developmental biology, and outlines future trends in leveraging DL to advance BioTree research. By addressing the challenges of data complexity and prior knowledge integration, this review aims to inspire interdisciplinary innovation at the intersection of biology and DL.</description>

      <title>Bioenergetic trophic trade-offs determine mass-dependent extinction thresholds across the Cenozoic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Body size drives the energetic demands of organisms, constraining trophic interactions between species and playing a significant role in shaping the feasibility of species' populations in a community. On macroevolutionary timescales, these demands feed back to shape the selective landscape driving the evolution of body size and diet. We develop a theoretical framework for a three-level trophic food chain -- typical for terrestrial mammalian ecosystems -- premised on bioenergetic trade-offs to explore mammalian population dynamics. Our results show that interactions between predators, prey, and external subsidies generate instabilities linked to body size extrema, corresponding to observed limits of predator size and diet. These instabilities generate size-dependent constraints on coexistence and highlight a feasibility range for carnivore size between 40 to 110 kg, encompassing the mean body size of terrestrial Cenozoic hypercarnivores. Finally, we show that predator dietary generalization confers a selective advantage to larger carnivores, which then declines at megapredator body sizes, aligning with diet breadth estimates for contemporary and Pleistocene species. Our framework underscores the importance of understanding macroevolutionary constraints through the lens of ecological pressures, where the selective forces shaping and reshaping the dynamics of communities can be explored.</description>

      <title>Genetic Composition of Supercritical Branching Populations under Power Law Mutation Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to understand the evolution of the genetic composition of cancer cell populations. To achieve this, we consider an individual-based model representing a cell population where cells divide, die and mutate along the edges of a finite directed graph $(V,E)$. The process starts with only one cell of trait $0$. Following typical parameter values in cancer cell populations we study the model under power law mutation rates, in the sense that the mutation probabilities are parametrized by negative powers of a scaling parameter $n$ and the typical sizes of the population of interest are positive powers of $n$. Under a non-increasing growth rate condition, we describe the time evolution of the first-order asymptotics of the size of each subpopulation in the $\log(n)$ time scale, as well as in the random time scale at which the wild-type population, resp. the total population, reaches the size $n^{t}$. In particular, such results allow for the perfect characterization of evolutionary pathways. Without imposing any conditions on the growth rates, we describe the time evolution of the order of magnitude of each subpopulation, whose asymptotic limits are positive non-decreasing piecewise linear continuous functions.</description>
