      <title>One-dimensional monoid algebras and ascending chains of principal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral domain $R$ is called atomic if every nonzero nonunit of $R$ factors into irreducibles, while $R$ satisfies the ascending chain condition on principal ideals if every ascending chain of principal ideals of $R$ stabilizes. It is well known and not hard to verify that if an integral domain satisfies the ACCP, then it must be atomic. The converse does not hold in general, but examples are hard to come by and most of them are the result of crafty and technical constructions. Sporadic constructions of such atomic domains have appeared in the literature in the last five decades, including the first example of a finite-dimensional atomic monoid algebra not satisfying the ACCP recently constructed by the second and third authors. Here we construct the first known one-dimensional monoid algebras satisfying the almost ACCP but not the ACCP (the almost ACCP is a notion weaker than the ACCP but still stronger than atomicity). Although the two constructions we provide here are rather technical, the corresponding monoid algebras are perhaps the most elementary known examples of atomic domains not satisfying the ACCP.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Khovanskii bases and MUVAK bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2019, Kaveh and Manon introduced Khovanskii bases as a special 'Gr\"obner-like' generating system of an algebra. We extend their work by considering an arbitrary grading on the algebra and propose a definition for a 'homogeneous Khovanskii basis' that respects this grading. We generalize Khovanskii bases further by taking multiple valuations into account (MUVAK bases). We give algorithms in both cases.
  MUVAK bases appear in the computation of the Cox ring of a minimal model of a quotient singularity. Our algorithm is an improvement of an algorithm by Yamagishi in this situation.</description>

      <title>Regularity of two classes of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent investigations indicate that for the classification of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals, it suffices to consider biconnected graphs with some whiskers attached (in short, `block with whiskers'). This paper provides explicit combinatorial formulae for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of two specific classes of Cohen-Macaulay binomial edge ideals: (i) chain of cycles with whiskers and (ii) $r$-regular $r$-connected block with whiskers. For the first type, we introduce a new invariant of graphs in terms of the number of blocks in certain induced block graphs, and this invariant may help determine the regularity of other classes of binomial edge ideals. For the second type, we present the formula as a linear function of $r$.</description>

      <title>A classification of finite groups with small Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. By a sequence over $G$, we mean a finite unordered string of terms from $G$ with repetition allowed, and we say that it is a product-one sequence if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity element of $G$. Then, the Davenport constant $\mathsf D (G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is a product-one sequence which cannot be partitioned into two non-trivial product-one subsequences. The Davenport constant is a combinatorial group invariant that has been studied fruitfully over several decades in additive combinatorics, invariant theory, and factorization theory, etc. Apart from a few cases of finite groups, the precise value of the Davenport constant is unknown. Even in the abelian case, little is known beyond groups of rank at most two. On the other hand, for a fixed positive integer $r$, structural results characterizing which groups $G$ satisfy $\mathsf D (G) = r$ are rare. We only know that there are finitely many such groups. In this paper, we study the classification of finite groups based on the Davenport constant.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of spaces of filtrations on local rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of spaces of fitrations on a Noetherian local domain. We introduce a metric $d_1$ on the space of saturated filtrations, inspired by the Darvas metric in complex geometry, such that it is a geodesic metric space. In the toric case, using Newton-Okounkov bodies, we identify the space of saturated monomial filtrations with a subspace of $L^1_\mathrm{loc}$. We also consider several other topologies on such spaces and study the semi-continuity of the log canonical threshold function in the spirit of Koll\'ar-Demailly. Moreover, there is a natural lattice structure on the space of saturated filtrations, which is a generalization of the classical result that the ideals of a ring form a lattice.</description>

      <title>On the gcd graphs over polynomial rings and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gcd-graphs over the ring of integers modulo $n$ are a natural generalization of unitary Cayley graphs. The study of these graphs has foundations in various mathematical fields, including number theory, ring theory, and representation theory. Using the theory of Ramanujan sums, it is known that these gcd-graphs have integral spectra; i.e., all their eigenvalues are integers. In this work, inspired by the analogy between number fields and function fields, we define and study gcd-graphs over polynomial rings with coefficients in finite fields. We establish some fundamental properties of these graphs, emphasizing their analogy to their counterparts over $\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>On the holes in $I^n$ for symmetric bilinear forms in characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field. Following the resolution of Milnor's conjecture relating the graded Witt ring of $F$ to its mod-2 Milnor $K$-theory, a major problem in the theory of symmetric bilinear forms is to understand, for any positive integer $n$, the low-dimensional part of $I^n(F)$, the $n$th power of the fundamental ideal in the Witt ring of $F$. In a 2004 paper, Karpenko used methods from the theory of algebraic cycles to show that if $\mathfrak{b}$ is a non-zero anisotropic symmetric bilinear form of dimension $&lt; 2^{n+1}$ representing an element of $I^n(F)$, then $\mathfrak{b}$ has dimension $2^{n+1} - 2^i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$. When $i = n$, a classical result of Arason and Pfister says that $\mathfrak{b}$ is similar to an $n$-fold Pfister form. At the next level, it has been conjectured that if $n \geq 2$ and $i= n-1$, then $\mathfrak{b}$ is isometric to the tensor product of an $(n-2)$-fold Pfister form and a $6$-dimensional form of trivial discriminant. This has only been shown to be true, however, when $n = 2$, or when $n = 3$ and $\mathrm{char}(F) \neq 2$ (another result of Pfister). In the present article, we prove the conjecture for all values of $n$ in the case where $\mathrm{char}(F) =2$. In addition, we give a short and elementary proof of Karpenko's theorem in the characteristic-2 case, rendering it free from the use of subtle algebraic-geometric tools. Finally, we consider the question of whether additional dimension gaps can appear among the anisotropic forms of dimension $\geq 2^{n+1}$ representing an element of $I^n(F)$. When $\mathrm{char}(F) \neq 2$, a result of Vishik asserts that there are no such gaps, but the situation seems to be less clear when $\mathrm{char}(F) = 2$.</description>

      <title>On a heuristic approach to the description of consciousness as a hypercomplex system state and the possibility of machine consciousness (German edition)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a heuristic view that shows that the inner states of consciousness experienced by every human being have a physical but imaginary hypercomplex basis. The hypercomplex description is necessary because certain processes of consciousness cannot be physically measured in principle, but nevertheless exist. Based on theoretical considerations, it could be possible - as a result of mathematical investigations into a so-called bicomplex algebra - to generate and use hypercomplex system states on machines in a targeted manner. The hypothesis of the existence of hypercomplex system states on machines is already supported by the surprising performance of highly complex AI systems. However, this has yet to be proven. In particular, there is a lack of experimental data that distinguishes such systems from other systems, which is why this question will be addressed in later articles. This paper describes the developed bicomplex algebra and possible applications of these findings to generate hypercomplex energy states on machines. In the literature, such system states are often referred to as machine consciousness. The article uses mathematical considerations to explain how artificial consciousness could be generated and what advantages this would have for such AI systems.</description>

      <title>Modules with commutative endomorphism rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we review and study $R$-modules $M$ for which $S = End_R(M)$ is commutative. For this, we define the concept of center of modules which is a natural generalization of the center of rings. The properties of center of modules, submodules and direct products and also, modules whose bi-endomorphism rings are commutative, have been considered. More generally, we study the sequence of the endomorphism rings and define the endo-commutativity dimension of modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to compare symbolic and ordinary powers of monomial ideals using commutative algebra and combinatorics. Monomial ideals whose symbolic and ordinary powers coincide are called Simis ideals. Weighted monomial ideals are defined by assigning linear weights to monomials. We examine Simis and normally torsion-free ideals, relate some of the properties of monomial ideals and weighted monomial ideals, and present a structure theorem for edge ideals of $d$-uniform clutters whose ideal of covers is Simis in degree $d$. One of our main results is a combinatorial classification of when the dual of the edge ideal of a weighted oriented graph is Simis in degree $2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08435v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration $\mathcal{I}=\{I_{[k]}\}_{k\ge0}$ is introduced. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{I}$ is Noetherian, we prove that the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(I_{[k]})$ is an eventually quasi-linear function. This result applies to several situations, including ordinary powers, and integral closures of ordinary powers, among others. As another application, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain integer programming problems. Finally, we present the Macaulay2 package $\texttt{VNumber}$.</description>

Abstract: The nearly Gorenstein property is a generalization of the Gorenstein property. In this paper, we introduce a new property $(\natural)$ that extends the nearly Gorenstein property in semi-standard graded rings. We show $(\natural)$ relates to a property in affine semigroup rings and generalizes results on Veronese subrings. Furthermore, $(\natural)$ and the nearly Gorenstein property are equivalent in Ehrhart rings of $(0,1)$-polytopes with the integer decomposition property and in rings with minimal multiplicity.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring and $S$ a multiplicative subset of $R$. In this paper, we obtain the ACC characterization, Cartan-Eilenberg-Bass theorem and the absolutely pure characterization for $S$-Noetherian rings. In details, we show that a ring $R$ is an $S$-Noetherian ring if and only if any ascending chain of ideals of $R$ is $S$-stationary, if and only if any direct sum of injective modules is $S$-injective, if and only if any direct limit of injective modules is $S$-injective, if and only if any $(S$-$)$absolutely pure module is $S$-injective. We also characterized $S$-$w$-Noetherian rings similarly.</description>

Abstract: In a survey paper in 2011, Amiot proposed a conjectural characterisation of the cluster categories which were conceived in the mid 2000s to lift the combinatorics of Fomin-Zelevinsky's cluster algebras to the categorical level. This paper is devoted to a proof of (a variant of) her conjecture. More generally, cluster categories admit higher-dimensional and relative variants, the so-called Higgs categories recently introduced by Wu. We also prove higher-dimensional and relative variants of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Deletion-addition of a smooth conic for free curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the behaviour of a free conic-line arrangement with respect to the deletion, respectively addition, of a smooth conic. Along the way we derive some restrictions on the geometry of the conic-line arrangement, induced by the freeness property. We show the same behaviour with respect to the deletion-addition of a smooth conic extends to general free reduced curves in the complex projective plane.</description>
