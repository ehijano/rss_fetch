      <title>Chase-escape with conversion as a multiple sclerosis lesion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce conversion to the stochastic process known as chase-escape in an effort to model aspects of inflammatory damage from multiple sclerosis. We prove monotonicity results for aggregate damage for the model on the positive integers, trees, stars, and the complete graph. Additionally, we establish the existence and asymptotic order of a phase transition on bounded degree graphs with a non-trivial site percolation threshold.</description>

      <title>Exponentially mixing flows with slow enhanced dissipation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a passive scalar which is advected by an incompressible flow $u$ and has small molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Previous results show that if $u$ is exponentially mixing and $C^1$, then the dissipation time is $O(|\log \kappa|^2)$. We produce a family of incompressible flows which are $C^0$ and exponentially mixing, uniformly in $\kappa$; however have a dissipation time of order $1/\kappa$ (i.e. exhibits no enhanced dissipation). We also estimate the dissipation time of mixing flows, and obtain improved bounds in terms of the mixing rate with explicit constants, and allow for a time inhomogeneous mixing rate which is typical for random constructions of mixing flows.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the adjoint path-kernel method for the parameter-gradient of SDEs, where the observable is averaged at a particular time or over the stationary measure. Its cost is almost independent of the number of parameters; it extends the conventional backpropagation method to cases with gradient explosion. It works for non-hyperbolic systems with multiplicative noise controlled by parameters. We derive a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system.</description>

      <title>Convergence of complex martingales in supercritical multi-type general branching processes in $L^q$ for $1 &lt; q \leq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nerman's martingale plays a central role in the law of large numbers for both, single- and multi-type, supercritical general branching processes. There are further, complex-valued Nerman-type martingales in the single-type process that figure in the finer fluctuations of these processes. We construct the analogous martingales for the process with finitely many types and give sufficient conditions for these martingales to converge in $L^q$ for $q \in (1,2]$.</description>

      <title>Random Lozenge Waterfall: Dimensional Collapse of Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the q-Racah probability measure on lozenge tilings of a hexagon whose side lengths scale linearly with a large parameter $L$, while the parameters $q\in(0,1)$ and $\kappa\in \mathbf{i}\mathbb{R}$ remain fixed. This regime differs fundamentally from the traditional case $q\sim e^{-c/L}\to1$, in which random tilings are locally governed by two-dimensional translation-invariant ergodic Gibbs measures. In the fixed-q regime we uncover a new macroscopic phase, the waterfall (previously only observed experimentally), where the two-dimensional Gibbs structure collapses into a one-dimensional random stepped interface that we call a barcode.
  We prove a law of large numbers and exponential concentration, showing that the random tilings converge to a deterministic waterfall profile. We further conjecture an explicit correlation kernel of the one-dimensional barcode process arising in the limit. Remarkably, the limit is invariant under shifts by $2\mathbb{Z}$ but not by $\mathbb{Z}$, exhibiting an emergent period-two structure absent from the original weights. Our conjectures are supported by extensive numerical evidence and perfect sampling simulations. The kernel is built from a family of functions orthogonal in both spaces $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z}+\frac12)$, that may be of independent interest.
  Our proofs adapt the spectral projection method of Borodin-Gorin-Rains (https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0679) to the regime with fixed~q. The resulting asymptotic analysis is substantially more involved, and leads to non-self-adjoint operators. We overcome these challenges in the exponential concentration result by a separate argument based on sharp bounds for the ratios of probabilities under the q-Racah orthogonal polynomial ensemble.</description>

      <title>Sharp moment and upper tail asymptotics for the critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While $1+1$ dimensional growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class have witnessed an explosion of activity, higher dimensional models remain much less explored. The special case of $2+1$ dimensions is particularly interesting as it is, in physics parlance, neither ultraviolet nor infrared super-renormalizable. Canonical examples include the stochastic heat equation (SHE) with multiplicative noise and directed polymers. The models exhibit a weak to strong disorder transition as the inverse temperature, up to a logarithmic (in the system size) scaling, crosses a critical value. While the sub-critical picture has been established in detail, very recently [CSZ '23] constructed a scaling limit of the critical $2+1$ dimensional directed polymer partition function, termed as the critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2.$ The SHF is expected to exhibit a rich intermittent behavior and consequently a rapid growth of its moments. The $h^{th}$ moment was known to grow at least as $\exp(\Omega(h^{2}))$ (a consequence of the Gaussian correlation inequality) and at most as $\exp(\exp (O(h^2)))$. The true growth rate, however, was predicted to be $\exp(\exp (\Theta(h)))$ in the late nineties [R '99]. In this paper we prove a lower bound of the $h^{th}$ moment which matches the predicted value, thereby exponentially improving the previous lower bound. We also obtain rather sharp bounds on its upper tail. The key ingredient in the proof involves establishing a new connection of the SHF and moments thereof to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) on related Feynman diagrams. This connection opens the door to the rich algebraic structure of the GFF to study the SHF. Along the way we also prove a new monotonicity property of the correlation kernel for the SHF as a consequence of the domain Markov property of the GFF.</description>

      <title>Exploration and aging of non-Markovian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores a central question: how does memory affect the way random walkers explore space? By analyzing various non-Markovian models, where past behavior directly influences future dynamics, we uncover new mechanisms and universal patterns in space exploration.
  In the first part, we study Locally Activated Random Walks (LARWs), where motion depends on the time spent at visited sites. These walks, though simply defined, display rich behaviors such as dynamical trapping, aging, and non-Gaussian diffusion. We identify confinement criteria, reveal a dynamical phase transition, and derive exact analytical results in several regimes.
  The second part focuses on Self-Interacting Random Walks (SIRWs), where the walker's own history governs future steps. Using advanced probabilistic tools, especially Ray-Knight theory, we compute exact results for observables such as splitting probabilities, persistence, first-passage times, number of visited sites, and aging effects. This includes the first exact expressions for aged observables in the saturating Self-Attracting Walk (SATW) model.
  In the third part, we propose a unified framework to describe memory effects in space exploration, based on the walker's tendency to reverse direction over time. This approach reveals robust patterns across a wide class of non-Markovian models, including fractional Brownian motion and the strongly self-interacting True Self-Avoiding Walk (TSAW), where we derive the first exact result for an aged observable in a non-saturating system.
  Together, these results show that memory-driven systems, though complex, can exhibit universal structures. This work offers new tools to analyze such dynamics and lays the groundwork for future research across physics, probability, and beyond.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of random Bernoulli convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate random Bernoulli convolutions, namely, probability measures given by the infinite convolution
  \[
  \mu_\omega = \mathop{\circledast}_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\delta_0 + \delta_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \ldots \lambda_{k-1} \lambda_k}}{2} \right),
  \]
  where $\omega=(\lambda_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables each following the uniform distribution on some fixed interval. We study the
  regularity of these measures and prove that when $\exp\mathbb{E}\left( \log \lambda_1\right)&gt;\frac{2}{\pi},$ the Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}_\omega$ is an $L^{1}$ function almost surely. This in
  turn implies that the corresponding random self-similar set supporting $\mu_{\omega}$ has
  non-empty interior almost surely. This improves upon a previous bound due to Peres, Simon and Solomyak. Furthermore, under no assumptions on the value of
  $\exp \mathbb{E}(\log \lambda_1),$ we prove that $\widehat \mu_\omega$ will decay to zero at a polynomial rate
  almost surely.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantum Field Theory on Curved Surfaces and Related Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $ P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese (arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the thesis.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Consistency in Machine Learning and Its Connection to Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e. the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets. Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.</description>

      <title>The spectra of graph substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,E_X)$ and $(V,E_V)$ be finite connected graphs without loops. We assume that $V$ has two distinguished vertices $a,b$ and an automorphism $\gamma$ which exchanges $a$ and $b$. The $V$-edge substitution of $X$ is the graph $X[V]$ where each edge $[x,y] \in E_X$ is replaced by a copy of $V$, identifying $x$ with $a$ and $y$ with $b$ or vice versa. (The latter choice does not matter; it yields isomorphic graphs). The aim is to describe the spectrum of $X[V]$ in terms of the spectra of $X$ and $V$. Instead of the spectra of the adjacency matrices, we consider the versions which are normalised by dividing each row by the row sum (the vertex degree). These are stochastic, reversible matrices, and our approach applies more generally to reversible transition matrices corresponding to arbitrary positive edge weights invariant under $\gamma$. We write $P$ for the transition matrix over $X$ and $Q$ for the one over $V$. Together, they induce the matrix $P_*$ over $X[V]$.
  There is not a nice and compact formula which says how to transform the spectra of $P$ and $Q$ into the spectrum of $P_*\,$. The results depend on issues like whether $X$ has circles of even length and on the eigenvalues of the restriction of $Q$ to $V \setminus \{ a,b\}$, which are classified into 4 possible types, each to be handled differently. Also quite subtle is the issue of determining the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of $P_*$ in terms of the input.</description>

      <title>Factorization by extremal privacy mechanisms: new insights into efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of efficiency under $\alpha$ local differential privacy ($\alpha$ LDP) in both discrete and continuous settings. Building on a factorization lemma, which shows that any privacy mechanism can be decomposed into an extremal mechanism followed by additional randomization, we reduce the Fisher information maximization problem to a search over extremal mechanisms. The representation of extremal mechanisms requires working in infinite dimensional spaces and invokes advanced tools from convex and functional analysis, such as Choquet's theorem. Our analysis establishes matching upper and lower bounds on the Fisher information in the high privacy regime ($\alpha \to 0$), and proves that the maximization problem always admits a solution for any $\alpha$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of estimating the parameter of a uniform distribution on $[0, \theta]$ under $\alpha$ LDP. Guided by our theoretical findings, we design an extremal mechanism that yields a consistent and asymptotically efficient estimator in high privacy regime. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Explicit non-asymptotic bounds for the distance to the first-order Edgeworth expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.05780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we obtain explicit bounds on the uniform distance between the cumulative distribution function of a standardized sum $S_n$ of $n$ independent centered random variables with moments of order four and its first-order Edgeworth expansion. Those bounds are valid for any sample size with $n^{-1/2}$ rate under moment conditions only and $n^{-1}$ rate under additional regularity constraints on the tail behavior of the characteristic function of $S_n$. In both cases, the bounds are further sharpened if the variables involved in $S_n$ are unskewed. We also derive new Berry-Esseen-type bounds from our results and discuss their links with existing ones. We finally apply our results to illustrate the lack of finite-sample validity of one-sided tests based on the normal approximation of the mean.</description>

      <title>The free energy of matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study multi-matrix models whose potentials are perturbations of the quadratic potential associated with independent GUE random matrices. More precisely, we compute the free energy and the expectation of the trace of polynomials evaluated in those matrices. We prove an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the matrix dimension to any order. Out of this result we deduce new formulas for map enumerations and the microstates free entropy. Our approach is based on the interpolation method between random matrices and free operators developed in [9, 31].</description>

      <title>Notes on hyperbolic branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07301v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euclidean branching Brownian motion (BBM) has been intensively studied during many decades by renowned researchers. BBM on hyperbolic space has received less attention. A profound study of Lalley and Sellke (1997) provided insight on the recurrent, resp. transient regimes of BBM on the Poincare' disk. In particular, they determined the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set on the boundary circle in dependence on the fission rate of the branching particles. In the present notes, further features are exhibited. The rates of the maximal and minimal hyperbolic distances to the starting point are determined, as well as refined asymptotic estimates in the transient regime. The other main issues studied here concern the behaviour of the empiricial distributions of the branching population, as time goes to infinity, and their convergence to an infinitely supported random limit probability measure on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Renewal and Regenerative Processes: short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document presents a compilation of results related to the theory of stochastic processes, with a specific focus on Markov processes, regenerative processes, renewal processes, and stationary processes. The relevance of these topics lies in the ability to identify regeneration points and the necessary conditions to ensure the stationarity of the process. The study begins with a review of Markov chains and continues with the analysis of processes that satisfy the strong Markov property. Subsequently, it delves into renewal processes, regenerative processes, and finally, stationary regenerative processes, highlighting the results presented by Thorisson [22]. This work is not intended to be exhaustive but aims to provide a solid foundation for further deepening the knowledge of these processes, given their broad range of applications in cryptography [16], queueing theory [15], and Monte Carlo methods [23]. Additionally, the importance of Poisson-type processes is emphasized due to their numerous applications (see [8]).</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of stochastic processes, with a particular focus on Markov chains and jump processes. The main results related to queuing systems are analyzed. Additionally, conditions that ensure the stability, or ergodicity, of such systems are presented. The paper also discusses stability results for queuing networks and their extension to visiting systems. Finally, key contributions concerning the Probability Generating Function, an essential tool in the analysis of the aforementioned processes, are introduced. The review is conducted from the perspective of queuing theory, grounded in the Kendall-Lee notation, emphasizing stability results and the computation of performance measures based on the specific characteristics of each process.</description>

      <title>The smallest singular value for rectangular random matrices with L\'evy entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=(x_{ij})\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times n}$ be a rectangular random matrix with i.i.d. entries (we assume $N/n\to\mathbf{a}&gt;1$), and denote by $\sigma_{min}(X)$ its smallest singular value. When entries have mean zero and unit second moment, the celebrated work of Bai-Yin and Tikhomirov show that $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sigma_{min}(X)$ converges almost surely to $\sqrt{\mathbf{a}}-1.$ However, little is known when the second moment is infinite. In this work we consider symmetric entry distributions satisfying $\mathbb{P}(|x_{ij}|&gt;t)\sim t^{-\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in(0,2)$, and
  prove that $\sigma_{min}(X)$ can be determined up to a log factor with high probability: for any $D&gt;0$, with probability at least $1-n^{-D}$ we have $$C_1n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}(\log n)^\frac{2(\alpha-2)}{\alpha}\leq \sigma_{min}(X)\leq C_2n^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}(\log n)^\frac{\alpha-2}{2\alpha}$$ for some constants $C_1,C_2&gt;0$. The upper bound was derived in a recent work of Bao, Lee and Xu \cite{bao2024phase2} but the lower bound is new and answers a problem posed in that paper in a weaker form. This appears to be the first determination of $\sigma_{min}(X)$ in the $\alpha$-stable case with a correct leading order of $n$, as previous anti-concentration arguments only yield lower bound $n^\frac{1}{2}$. The same lower bound holds for $\sigma_{min}(X+B)$ for any fixed rectangular matrix $B$ with no assumption on its operator norm. The case of diverging aspect ratio is also computed.</description>

      <title>Moment generating functions and moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Aistleitner, Gantert, Kabluchko, Prochno and Ramanan studied large deviation principles (LDPs) for lacunary trigonometric sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2 \pi n_k x)$, where the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfies the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1} / n_k \geq q &gt; 1$ for $k \geq 1$. A crucial ingredient in their work were asymptotic estimates for the moment generating function (MGF) of such sums, which turned out to depend on the fine arithmetic structure of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ in an intricate way. In the present paper we carry out a detailed study of the MGF for lacunary trigonometric sums (without any structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, other than lacunarity), and we determine the sharp threshold where arithmetic effects start to play a role. As an application, we prove moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums, and show that the tail probabilities are in accordance with Gaussian behavior throughout the whole range between the central limit theorem and the LDP regime.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-free additive and multiplicative convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, introduced independently by Szeg\"{o} and Walsh in the 1920s. These operations have regained some interest, in the last decade, after being rediscovered by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava as the expected characteristic polynomial of randomly rotated matrices. They converge, as the degree $d$ of the polynomials increases, to the additive and multiplicative convolution of measures from free probability of Voiculescu. In this paper, we investigate the fluctuations of order $1/d$ -- also known as infinitesimal distributions -- related to these two operations and their limiting behavior, providing a detailed description of their convergence. Our approach relies on understanding the infinitesimal moment-cumulant formulas and the corresponding functional relations. We also establish several applications and examples, including instances related to the infinitesimal free convolution of Belinschi and Shlyakhtenko, as well as the computation of infinitesimal distributions after differentiation of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Critical points of random polynomials and finite free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result of Hoskins and Steinerberger [Int. Math. Res. Not., (13):9784-9809, 2022] states that repeatedly differentiating a random polynomials with independent and identically distributed mean zero and variance one roots will result, after an appropriate rescaling, in a Hermite polynomial. We use the theory of finite free probability to extend this result in two natural directions: (1) We prove central limit theorems for the fluctuations around these deterministic limits for the polynomials and their roots. (2) We consider a generalized version of the Hoskins and Steinerberger result by removing the finite second moment assumption from the roots. In this case the Hermite polynomials are replaced by a random Appell sequence conveniently described through finite free probability and an infinitely divisible distribution. We use finite free cumulants to provide compact proofs of our main results with little prerequisite knowledge of free probability required.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Mixed p-Spin Spherical Model: Breakdown of Ultrametricity and Failure of the Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the two cornerstones of mean-field spin glass theory -- the Parisi variational formula and the ultrametric organization of pure states -- break down under heavy-tailed disorder. For the mixed spherical $p$-spin model whose couplings have tail exponent $\alpha&lt;2$, we attach to each $p$ an explicit threshold $H_p^{*}$. If any coupling exceeds its threshold, a single dominant monomial governs both the limiting free energy and the entire Gibbs measure; the resulting energy landscape is intrinsically probabilistic, with a sharp failure of ultrametricity for $p\ge4$ and persistence of only a degenerate 1-RSB structure for $p\le3$. When all couplings remain below their thresholds, the free energy is $O(n^{-1})$ and the overlap is near zero, resulting in a trivial Gibbs geometry. For $\alpha&lt;1$ we further obtain exact fluctuations of order $n^{1-p}$. Our proof introduces Non-Intersecting Monomial Reduction (NIMR), an algebraic-combinatorial technique that blends convexity analysis, extremal combinatorics and concentration on the sphere, providing the first rigorous description of both regimes for heavy-tailed spin glasses with $p\ge3$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MMVSDEs) driven by L\'evy noise with non-Lipschitz coefficients. It is important to note that these findings are based upon the well-posedness of strong solutions for MMVSDEs under Lipschitz conditions, which will be stated briefly. Secondly, we study the existence of weak solutions under linear growth condition. Finally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of regional lockdown strategies in mitigating pathogen spread across regional units, termed cities hereinafter. We develop simplified models to analyze infection spread across cities within a country during an epidemic wave. Isolation of a city is initiated when infection numbers within the city surpass defined thresholds. We compare two strategies: strategy (P) consists in prescribing thresholds proportionally to city sizes, while the same threshold is used for all cities under strategy (U). Given the heavy-tailed distribution of city sizes, strategy (P) may result in more secondary infections from larger cities than strategy (U).
  Random graph models are constructed to represent infection spread as a percolation process. In particular, we consider a model in which mobility between cities only depends on city sizes. We assess the relative efficiency of the two strategies by comparing the ratios of the number of individuals under isolation to the total number of infections by the end of the epidemic wave under strategy (P) and (U). Additionally, we derive analytical formulas for disease prevalence and basic reproduction numbers.
  Our models are calibrated using mobility data from France, Poland and Japan, validated through simulation. The findings indicate that mobility between cities in France and Poland is mainly determined by city sizes. However, a poor fit was observed with Japanese data, highlighting the importance to include other factors like e.g. geography for some countries in modeling. Our analysis suggest similar effectiveness for both strategies in France and Japan, while strategy (U) demonstrates distinct merits in Poland.</description>

      <title>Voting by mail: a Markov chain model for managing the security risks of election systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scrutiny surrounding vote-by-mail (VBM) in the United States has increased in recent years, raising concerns about the integrity and security of absentee voting. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a dynamic mathematical modeling framework for performing a risk assessment of VBM processes. We introduce a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to model the VBM process and assess election performance and risk with a novel layered network approach that considers the interplay between VBM processes, malicious and non-malicious threats, and security mitigations. The time-inhomogeneous DTMC framework captures dynamic risks and evaluates performance over time. The DTMC model accounts for a spectrum of outcomes, from unintended voter errors to sophisticated, targeted attacks, representing a significant advancement in the risk assessment of VBM planning and protection. A case study based on real-world data from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is used to evaluate the DTMC model. The analysis includes the development of attack scenarios and the evaluation of security measures, to illustrate the impact of different attack timings. The analysis suggests that ballot drop boxes and automatic ballot notification systems are crucial for ensuring secure and reliable operations.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with (1) the truncated matrix Hamburger moment problem from the point of view of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector valued entire functions of the kind introduced and extensively studied by Louis de Branges and (2) the truncated matrix trigonometric moment problem viewed through an analogous class of spaces that are formulated with respect to the open unit disc rather than the open upper half-plane. In this approach projections are computed via appropriately chosen reproducing kernels instead of orthogonal bases. This approach eases the bookkeeping and leads to pleasing formulas.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor logconcave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau-Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing, and show consequently that the performance of samplers like ULA does not necessarily degenerate arbitrarily with low regularity. In particular, we show that the Lipschitz or H\"older continuity assumption can be replaced by a geometric one-sided Lipschitz condition that allows even for discontinuous log-gradients. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non-asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>
