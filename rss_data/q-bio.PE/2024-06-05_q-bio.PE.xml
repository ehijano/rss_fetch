      <title>Long-term behavior of stochastic SIQRS epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze and classify the dynamics of SIQRS epidemiological models with susceptible, infected, quarantined, and recovered classes, where the recovered individuals can become reinfected. We are able to treat general incidence functional responses. Our models are more realistic than what has been studied in the literature since they include two important types of random fluctuations. The first type is due to small fluctuations of the various model parameters and leads to white noise terms. The second type of noise is due to significant environment regime shifts in the that can happen at random. The environment switches randomly between a finite number of environmental states, each with a possibly different disease dynamic. We prove that the long-term fate of the disease is fully determined by a real-valued threshold $\lambda$. When $\lambda &lt; 0$ the disease goes extinct asymptotically at an exponential rate. On the other hand, if $\lambda &gt; 0$ the disease will persist indefinitely. We end our analysis by looking at some important examples where $\lambda$ can be computed explicitly, and by showcasing some simulation results that shed light on real-world situations.</description>

      <title>Apparent structural changes in contact patterns during COVID-19 were driven by survey design and long-term demographic trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social contact patterns are key drivers of infectious disease transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, differences between pre-COVID and COVID-era contact rates were widely attributed to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns. However, the factors that drive changes in the distribution of contacts between different subpopulations remain poorly understood. Here, we present a clustering analysis of 33 contact matrices generated from surveys conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and analyse key features distinguishing their topological structures. While we expected to identify aspects of pandemic scenarios responsible for these features, our analysis demonstrates that they can be explained by differences in study design and long-term demographic trends. Our results caution against using survey data from different studies in counterfactual analysis of epidemic mitigation strategies. Doing so risks attributing differences stemming from methodological choices or long-term changes to the short-term effects of interventions.</description>

      <title>Input-output reduced order modeling for public health intervention evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mathematical models have become an indispensable tool in the planning, evaluation, and implementation of public health interventions. Models must often provide detailed information for many levels of population stratification. Such detail comes at a price: in addition to the computational costs, the number of considered input parameters can be large, making effective study design difficult. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel technique to reduce the dimension of the model input space to simplify model-informed intervention planning. The method works by first applying a dimension reduction technique on the model output space. We then develop a method which allows us to map each reduced output to a corresponding vector in the input space, thereby reducing its dimension. We apply the method to the HIV Optimization and Prevention Economics (HOPE) model, to validate the approach and establish proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Understanding the genetic basis of variation in meiotic recombination: past, present, and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Meiotic recombination is a fundamental feature of sexually reproducing species. It is often required for proper chromosome segregation and plays important role in adaptation and the maintenance of genetic diversity. The molecular mechanisms of recombination are remarkably conserved across eukaryotes, yet meiotic genes and proteins show substantial variation in their sequence and function, even between closely related species. Furthermore, the rate and distribution of recombination shows a huge diversity within and between chromosomes, individuals, sexes, populations, and species. This variation has implications for many molecular and evolutionary processes, yet how and why this diversity has evolved is not well understood. A key step in understanding trait evolution is to determine its genetic basis - that is, the number, effect sizes, and distribution of loci underpinning variation. In this perspective, I discuss past and current knowledge on the genetic basis of variation in recombination rate and distribution, explore its evolutionary implications, and present open questions for future research.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to higher-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>
