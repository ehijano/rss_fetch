      <title>SyROCCo: Enhancing Systematic Reviews using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sheer number of research outputs published every year makes systematic reviewing increasingly time- and resource-intensive. This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques to help navigate the systematic review process. ML has previously been used to reliably 'screen' articles for review - that is, identify relevant articles based on reviewers' inclusion criteria. The application of ML techniques to subsequent stages of a review, however, such as data extraction and evidence mapping, is in its infancy. We therefore set out to develop a series of tools that would assist in the profiling and analysis of 1,952 publications on the theme of 'outcomes-based contracting'. Tools were developed for the following tasks: assign publications into 'policy area' categories; identify and extract key information for evidence mapping, such as organisations, laws, and geographical information; connect the evidence base to an existing dataset on the same topic; and identify subgroups of articles that may share thematic content. An interactive tool using these techniques and a public dataset with their outputs have been released. Our results demonstrate the utility of ML techniques to enhance evidence accessibility and analysis within the systematic review processes. These efforts show promise in potentially yielding substantial efficiencies for future systematic reviewing and for broadening their analytical scope. Our work suggests that there may be implications for the ease with which policymakers and practitioners can access evidence. While ML techniques seem poised to play a significant role in bridging the gap between research and policy by offering innovative ways of gathering, accessing, and analysing data from systematic reviews, we also highlight their current limitations and the need to exercise caution in their application, particularly given the potential for errors and biases.</description>

      <title>Automatically detecting scientific political science texts from a large general document index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This technical report outlines the filtering approach applied to the collection of the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) data to extract articles from the political science domain. We combined hard and soft filters to address entries with different available metadata, e.g. title, abstract or keywords. The hard filter is a weighted keyword-based approach. The soft filter uses a multilingual BERT-based classification model, trained to detect scientific articles from the political science domain. We evaluated both approaches using an annotated dataset, consisting of scientific articles from different scientific domains. The weighted keyword-based approach achieved the highest total accuracy of 0.88. The multilingual BERT-based classification model was fine-tuned using a dataset of 14,178 abstracts from scientific articles and reached the highest total accuracy of 0.98. The proposed filtering approach can be applied for filtering metadata from other scientific domains and therefore improve the overview of the domain-related literature and facilitate efficiency in research.</description>

      <title>Searching COVID-19 Clinical Research Using Graph Queries: Algorithm Development and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: This study aims to consider small graphs of concepts and exploit them for expressing graph searches over existing COVID-19-related literature, leveraging the increasing use of graphs to represent and query scientific knowledge and providing a user-friendly search and exploration experience. Methods: We considered the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset corpus and summarized its content by annotating the publications' abstracts using terms selected from the UMLS and the Ontology of Coronavirus Infectious Disease. Then, we built a co-occurrence network that includes all relevant concepts mentioned in the corpus, establishing connections when their mutual information is relevant. A sophisticated graph query engine was built to allow the identification of the best matches of graph queries on the network. It also supports partial matches and suggests potential query completions using shortest paths. Results: We built a large co-occurrence network, consisting of 128,249 entities and 47,198,965 relationships; the GRAPH-SEARCH interface allows users to explore the network by formulating or adapting graph queries; it produces a bibliography of publications, which are globally ranked; and each publication is further associated with the specific parts of the query that it explains, thereby allowing the user to understand each aspect of the matching. Conclusions: Our approach supports the process of query formulation and evidence search upon a large text corpus; it can be reapplied to any scientific domain where documents corpora and curated ontologies are made available.</description>
