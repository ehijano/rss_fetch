      <title>FlexRT -- A fast and flexible cosmological radiative transfer code for reionization studies I: Code validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wealth of high-quality observational data from the epoch of reionization that will become available in the next decade motivates further development of modeling techniques for their interpretation. Among the key challenges in modeling reionization are (1) its multi-scale nature, (2) the computational demands of solving the radiative transfer (RT) equation, and (3) the large size of reionization's parameter space. In this paper, we present and validate a new RT code designed to confront these challenges. FlexRT (Flexible Radiative Transfer) combines adaptive ray tracing with a highly flexible treatment of the intergalactic ionizing opacity. This gives the user control over how the intergalactic medium (IGM) is modeled, and provides a way to reduce the computational cost of a FlexRT simulation by orders of magnitude while still accounting for small-scale IGM physics. Alternatively, the user may increase the angular and spatial resolution of the algorithm to run a more traditional reionization simulation. FlexRT has already been used in several contexts, including simulations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$ quasars, the redshifted 21cm signal from reionization, as well as in higher resolution reionization simulations in smaller volumes. In this work, we motivate and describe the code, and validate it against a set of standard test problems from the Cosmological Radiative Transfer Comparison Project. We find that FlexRT is in broad agreement with a number of existing RT codes in all of these tests. Lastly, we compare FlexRT to an existing adaptive ray tracing code to validate FlexRT in a cosmological reionization simulation.</description>

      <title>The Abundance of Clustered Primordial Black Holes from Quasar Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While elementary particles are the favored candidate for the elusive dark matter, primordial black holes (PBHs) have also been considered to fill that role. Gravitational microlensing is a very well-suited tool to detect and measure the abundance of compact objects in galaxies. Previous studies based on quasar microlensing exclude a significant presence of substellar to intermediate-mass BHs ($\lesssim 100\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$). However, these studies were based on a spatially uniform distribution of BHs while, according to current theories of PBHs formation, they are expected to appear in clusters. We study the impact of clustering in microlensing flux magnification finding that at large scales clusters act like giant pseudo-particles, strongly affecting the emission coming from the Broad Line Region, which can no longer be used to define the zero microlensing baseline. As an alternative, we set this baseline from the intrinsic magnification ratios of quasar images predicted by macro lens models and compare them with the observed flux ratios in emission lines, infrared (IR), and radio. The (magnitude) differences are the flux-ratio anomalies attributable to microlensing, which we estimate for 35 image pairs corresponding to 12 lens systems. A Bayesian analysis indicates that the observed anomalies are incompatible with the existence of a significant population of clustered PBHs. Furthermore, we find that more compact clusters exhibit a stronger microlensing impact. Consequently, we conclude that clustering makes the existence of a significant population of BHs in the substellar to intermediate mass range even more unlikely.</description>

      <title>Superclustering with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Dark Energy Survey: II. Anisotropic large-scale coherence in hot gas, galaxies, and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistics that capture the directional dependence of the baryon distribution in the cosmic web enable unique tests of cosmology and astrophysical feedback. We use constrained oriented stacking of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) maps to measure the anisotropic distribution of hot gas $2.5-40$ Mpc away from galaxy clusters embedded in massive filaments and superclusters. The cluster selection and orientation (at a scale of $\sim15$ Mpc) use Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data, while expanded tSZ maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 enable a $\sim3\times$ more significant measurement of the extended gas compared to the technique's proof-of-concept. Decomposing stacks into cosine multipoles of order $m$, we detect a dipole ($m=1$) and quadrupole ($m=2$) at $8-10\sigma$, as well as evidence for $m=4$ signal at up to $6\sigma$, indicating sensitivity to late-time non-Gaussianity. We compare to the Cardinal simulations with spherical gas models pasted onto dark matter halos. The fiducial tSZ data can discriminate between two models that deplete pressure differently in low-mass halos (mimicking astrophysical feedback), preferring higher average pressure in extended structures. However, uncertainty in the amount of cosmic infrared background contamination reduces the constraining power. Additionally, we apply the technique to DES galaxy density and weak lensing to study for the first time their oriented relationships with tSZ. In the tSZ-to-lensing relation, averaged on 7.5 Mpc (transverse) scales, we observe dependence on redshift but not shape or radial distance. Thus, on large scales, the superclustering of gas pressure, galaxies, and total matter is coherent in shape and extent.</description>

      <title>Mass &amp; Light in Galaxy Clusters: The case of Abell 370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric strong lensing studies of galaxy clusters often display "misleading features". This is the case in the galaxy cluster Abell 370. Using strong lensing techniques, it has been described parametrically by a four dark matter clumps model and galaxy scale perturbers, as well as a significant external shear component, which physical origin remains a challenge. The dark matter distribution features a mass clump with no stellar counterpart and a significant offset between one of the dark matter clumps and its associated stellar counterpart. In this paper, based on BUFFALO data, we begin by revisiting this mass model. We find a four dark matter clumps solution which does not require any external shear and provides a slightly better RMS compared to previous models. Investigating further this new solution, we present a class of models which can accurately reproduce the strong lensing data, but whose parameters for the dark matter component are poorly constrained. We then develop a model where each large scale dark matter component must be associated with a stellar counterpart. This model is unable to reproduce the observational constraints with an RMS smaller than 2.3", and the parameters describing this dark matter component remain poorly constrained. Examining the total projected mass maps, we find a good agreement between the total mass and the stellar distribution, both being bimodal. We interpret the "misleading features" of the four dark matter clumps mass model and the failure of the three dark matter clumps mass model as being symptomatic of the lack of realism of a parametric description of the dark matter distribution, and encourage caution and criticism on the outputs of parametric strong lensing modelling. We briefly discuss the implications of our results for using Abell 370 as a gravitational telescope.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: Simulations and volume limited sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) constitute an historical probe to derive cosmological parameters through the fit of the Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram, i.e. SN Ia distance modulus versus their redshift. In the era of precision cosmology, realistic simulation of SNe Ia for any survey entering in an Hubble-Lema\^itre diagram is a key tool to address observational systematics, like Malmquist bias. As the distance modulus of SNe Ia is derived from the fit of their light-curves, a robust simulation framework is required. In this paper, we present the performances of the simulation framework skysurvey to reproduce the the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) SN Ia DR2 covering the first phase of ZTF running from April 2018 up to December 2020. The ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample correspond to almost 3000 classified SNe Ia of cosmological quality. First, a targeted simulation of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 was carried on to check the validity of the framework after some fine tuning of the observing conditions and instrument performance. Then, a realistic simulation has been run using observing ZTF logs and ZTF SN Ia DR2 selection criteria on simulated light-curves to demonstrate the ability of the simulation framework to match the ZTF SN Ia DR2 sample. Furthermore a redshift dependency of SALT2 light-curve parameters (stretch and colour) was conducted to deduce a volume limited sample, i.e. an unbiased SNe Ia sample, characterized with $z_{lim} \leq 0.06$. This volume limited sample of about 1000 SNe Ia is unique to carry on new analysis on standardization procedure with a precision never reached (those analysis are presented in companion papers).</description>

      <title>A new unified dark sector model and its implications on the $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduced the Unified Three-Form Dark Sector (UTFDS) model, a unified dark sector model that combines dark energy and dark matter through a three-form field. In this framework, the potential of the three-form field acts as dark matter, while the kinetic term represents dark energy. The interaction between dark matter and dark energy is driven by the energy exchange between these two terms. Given the dynamical equations of UTFDS, we provide an autonomous system of evolution equations for UTFDS and perform a stability analysis of its fixed points. The result aligns with our expectations for a unified dark sector. Furthermore, we discover that the dual Lagrangian of the UTFDS Lagrangian is equivalent to a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian. By fixing the parameter $\kappa X_0$ to 250, 500, 750, we refer to the resulting models as the $\overline{\rm UTFDS}$ model with $\kappa X_0$=250, 500, 750, respectively. We then place constraints on these three $\overline{\rm UTFDS}$ models and the $\Lambda$CDM model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) observations, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the $S_8$ prior chosen according to the KiDS1000 Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) measuement. We find that the $\overline{\rm UTFDS}$ model with $\kappa X_0$=500 is the only one among the four models where both $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ tensions, between CMB and RSD+BAO+WL datasets, are below 2.0$\sigma$. Furthermore, the tensions are relieved without exacerbating the $H_0$ tension. Although both the CMB and RSD+BAO+WL datasets provide definite/positive evidence favoring $\Lambda$CDM over the $\overline{\rm UTFDS}$ model with $\kappa X_0$=500, the evidence is not strong enough to rule out further study of this model.</description>

      <title>The re-markable 21-cm power spectrum I: Probing the HI distribution in the post-reionization era using marked statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutral hydrogen (HI) power spectrum, measured from intensity fluctuations in the 21-cm background, offers insights into the large-scale structures (LSS) of our Universe in the post-reionization era (redshift $z&lt;6$). A significant amount of HI is expected to reside in low- and intermediate-density environments, but the power spectrum mainly captures information from high-density regions. To more fully extract the information contained in the HI field, we investigate the use of a marked power spectrum statistic. Here, the power spectrum is effectively re-weighted using a non-linear mark function which depends on the smoothed local density, such that low- or high-density regions are up- or down-weighted. This approach may also capture information on some higher-order statistical moments of the field. We model the HI distribution using semi-numerical simulations and for the first time study the marked HI power spectrum, across $1 \leq z \leq 5$. Our analysis indicates that there is considerable evolution of the HI field during the post-reionization era. Over a wide range of length scales (comoving wave numbers $0.05\leq k \leq 1.0$ Mpc$^{-1}$) we expectedly find that the HI evolves slowly at early times, but more rapidly at late times. This evolution is not well-captured by the power spectrum of the standard (unmarked) HI field. We also study how the evolution of the HI field depends on the chosen smoothing scale for the mark, and how this affects the marked power spectrum. We conclude that the information about the HI content at low and intermediate densities is important for a correct and consistent analysis of HI content and evolution based on the 21-cm background. The marked power spectrum can thus provide a less biased statistic for parameter constraints than the normal power spectrum.</description>

      <title>SCALE at Scale: Cosmological applications of small-scale CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Small-Correlated-Against-Large Estimator (SCALE) for small-scale lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a novel method for measuring the amplitude of CMB lensing power without the need for reconstruction of the lensing field. In our previous study, we showed that the SCALE method can outperform existing reconstruction methods to detect the presence of lensing at small scales ($\ell \gg 3000$). Here we develop a procedure to include information from SCALE in cosmological parameter inference. We construct a precise neural network emulator to quickly map cosmological parameters to desired CMB observables such as temperature and lensing power spectra and SCALE cross spectra. We also outline a method to apply SCALE to full-sky maps of the CMB temperature field, and construct a likelihood for the application of SCALE in parameter estimation. SCALE supplements conventional observables such as the CMB power spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations in constraining parameters that are sensitive to the small-scale lensing amplitude such as the neutrino mass $m_\nu$. We show that including estimates of the small-scale lensing amplitude from SCALE in such an analysis provides enough constraining information to measure the minimum neutrino mass at $4\sigma$ significance in the scenario of minimal mass, and higher significance for higher mass. Finally, we show that SCALE will play a powerful role in constraining models of clustering that generate scale-dependent modulation to the distribution of matter and the lensing power spectrum, as predicted by models of warm or fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation, also know as $E$-model, in the light of current CMB and LSS observations. The inflaton potential in the Einstein frame for this model contains a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential, which alters the predictions for the scalar and tensor power spectra of Starobinsky inflation. We obtain these power spectra numerically without using slow-roll approximation and perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on parameters $M$ and $\alpha$ from Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We consider general reheating scenario by varying the number of e-foldings during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, along with the other parameters. We find $\log_{10}\alpha = 0.0^{+1.6}_{-5.6}$, $\log_{10}M= -4.91^{+0.69}_{-2.7}$ and $N_{pivot} = 53.2^{+3.9}_{-5}$ with $95\%$ C. L.. This implies that the present CMB and LSS observations are insufficient to constrain the parameter $\alpha$. We also find that there is no correlation between $N_{pivot}$ and $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>ForestFlow: cosmological emulation of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest clustering from linear to nonlinear scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On large scales, measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest offer insights into the expansion history of the Universe, while on small scales, these impose strict constraints on the growth history, the nature of dark matter, and the sum of neutrino masses. This work introduces ForestFlow, a cosmological emulator designed to bridge the gap between large- and small-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest analyses. Using conditional normalizing flows, ForestFlow emulates the 2 Lyman-$\alpha$ linear biases ($b_\delta$ and $b_\eta$) and 6 parameters describing small-scale deviations of the 3D flux power spectrum ($P_\mathrm{3D}$) from linear theory. These 8 parameters are modeled as a function of cosmology $\unicode{x2013}$ the small-scale amplitude and slope of the linear power spectrum $\unicode{x2013}$ and the physics of the intergalactic medium. Thus, in combination with a Boltzmann solver, ForestFlow can predict $P_\mathrm{3D}$ on arbitrarily large (linear) scales and the 1D flux power spectrum ($P_\mathrm{1D}$) $\unicode{x2013}$ the primary observable for small-scale analyses $\unicode{x2013}$ without the need for interpolation or extrapolation. Consequently, ForestFlow enables for the first time multiscale analyses. Trained on a suite of 30 fixed-and-paired cosmological hydrodynamical simulations spanning redshifts from $z=2$ to $4.5$, ForestFlow achieves $3$ and $1.5\%$ precision in describing $P_\mathrm{3D}$ and $P_\mathrm{1D}$ from linear scales to $k=5\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k_\parallel=4\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively. Thanks to its parameterization, the precision of the emulator is also similar for both ionization histories and two extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model $\unicode{x2013}$ massive neutrinos and curvature $\unicode{x2013}$ not included in the training set. ForestFlow will be crucial for the cosmological analysis of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements from the DESI survey.</description>

Abstract: Marked power spectra provide a computationally efficient way to extract non-Gaussian information from the matter density field using the usual analysis tools developed for the power spectrum without the need for explicit calculation of higher-order correlators. In this work, we explore the optimal form of the mark function used for re-weighting the density field, to maximally constrain cosmology. We show that adding to the mark function or multiplying it by a constant leads to no additional information gain, which significantly reduces our search space for optimal marks. We quantify the information gain of this optimal function and compare it against mark functions previously proposed in the literature. We find that we can gain around $\sim2$ times smaller errors in $\sigma_8$ and $\sim4$ times smaller errors in $\Omega_m$ compared to using the traditional power spectrum alone, an improvement of $\sim60\%$ compared to other proposed marks when applied to the same dataset.</description>

      <title>Implications of feedback solutions to the $S_8$ tension for the baryon fractions of galaxy groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large-scale structure (LSS) surveys have revealed a persistent tension in the value of $S_8$ compared to predictions from the standard cosmological model. This tension may suggest the need for new physics beyond the standard model, but an accurate characterisation of baryonic effects is essential to avoid biases. Although some studies indicate that baryonic effects are too small to resolve this tension, others propose that more aggressive feedback mechanisms could reconcile differences between cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements and low-redshift LSS observations. In this paper, we investigate the role of baryonic effects in alleviating the $S_8$ tension. We extend the SP(k) model (Salcido et al. 2023), which was trained on hundreds of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to map the suppression of the matter power spectrum to the baryon fraction in groups and clusters, to predict the required baryon fraction for a given $P(k)$ suppression. We then compare predictions from recent cosmic shear (weak lensing) analyses with the latest baryon budget measurements from X-ray and weak gravitational lensing studies. Our findings show that studies marginalising over baryonic effects while fixing cosmological parameters to a Planck-like cosmology predict strong $P(k)$ suppression and baryon fractions that are much lower than existing low-redshift baryon budget estimates of galaxy groups and clusters. Conversely, most studies that marginalise over both cosmological parameters and baryonic effects imply baryon fractions that are consistent with observations but lower values of $S_8$ than inferred from the CMB. Unless the observed baryon fractions are biased high by a factor of several, these results suggest that a mechanism beyond baryonic physics alone is required to modify or slow down the growth of structure in the universe in order to resolve the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Environmental dependence on galaxy-halo connections for satellites using HSC weak lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the luminosity-halo mass relations of satellite (sLHMRs) galaxies in the SDSS redMaPPer cluster catalogue and the effects of the dense cluster environment on subhalo mass evolution. We use data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey Year-3 catalogue of galaxy shapes to measure the weak lensing signal around these satellites. This signal serves as a probe of the matter distribution around the satellites, thereby providing the masses of their associated subhalos. We bin our satellites based on physical observable quantities such as their luminosity or the host cluster's richness, combined with their cluster-centric radial separations. Our results indicate that although more luminous satellites tend to reside in more massive halos, the sLHMRs depend on the distance of the satellite from the cluster centre. Subhalos near the cluster centre (within $&lt;0.3 h^{-1}Mpc$) are stripped of mass. Consequently, the ratio of subhalo mass to luminosity decreases near the cluster centre. For low luminosity galaxies ($L &lt; 10^{10} h^{-2}L_{\odot}$), the lack of evidence of increasing subhalo masses with luminosity shows the impact of tidal stripping. We also present stellar-to-subhalo mass relations (sSHMRs) for our satellite sample evolving at different cluster-centric separations. Inferred sSHMRs in the outer radial bin appear to match that observed for the field galaxies. We show that the sSHMRs from the mock-redMaPPer run on galaxy catalogues generated by the empirical UniverseMachine galaxy formation model are in good agreement with our observational results. Satellites, when binned based on the host cluster's richness, show very little dependence of the subhalo mass on the richness.</description>

      <title>A model for inflaton induced baryogenesis and its phenomenological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach aimed at addressing the longstanding baryon-anti-baryon asymmetry conundrum. Our proposed mechanism suggests that baryon numbers were generated during the inflationary epoch through the dynamics of the inflaton field coupled with an explicit baryon number violating interaction. Notably, during inflation, it is possible to halt the baryon number generation process via a symmetry restoration phase transition. We elucidate that prior to this phase transition, baryon numbers could be synthesized and preserved within classical field configurations. Subsequently, following the phase transition, these baryon numbers were liberated as particles. Crucially, we demonstrate that this mechanism of baryon number production is intricately linked with significant cosmological collider signals and gravitational wave (GW) signals, offering a compelling framework to explore the origins of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Measuring the speed of light with cosmological observations: current constraints and forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the speed of light with current observations, such as Type Ia Supernova, galaxy ages, radial BAO mode, as well as simulations of future redshift surveys and gravitational waves as standard sirens. By means of a Gaussian Process reconstruction, we find that the precision of such measurements can be improved from roughly 6\% to 1.5-2\%, in light of these forthcoming observations. This result demonstrates that we will be able to perform a cosmological measurement of a fundamental physical constant with unprecedented precision, which will help us underpinning if its value is truly consistent with local measurements, as predicted by the standard model of Cosmology.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>The formation and disruption of globular cluster populations in simulations of present-day $L^\ast$ galaxies with controlled assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are sensitive tracers of galaxy assembly histories but interpreting the information they encode is challenging because mergers are thought to promote both the formation and disruption of GCs. We use simulations with controlled merger histories to examine the influence of merger mass ratio on the GC population of a present-day $L^\ast$ galaxy, using the genetic modification technique to adjust the initial conditions of a galaxy that experiences major mergers at $z = 1.7$ and $z = 0.77$ (ORGANIC case), so the later merger has twice its original mass ratio (ENHANCED case), or is prevented from occurring (SUPPRESSED case). We evolve the three realizations with E-MOSAICS, which couples sub-grid star cluster formation and evolution models to the EAGLE galaxy formation model. Relative to the ORGANIC case, the mass of surviving GCs is elevated (reduced) in the ENHANCED (SUPPRESSED) case, indicating that major mergers promote a net boost to the GC population. The boost is clearly quantified by the GC specific mass, $S_{\rm M}$, because it is sensitive to the number of the most massive GCs, whose long characteristic disruption timescales enable them to survive their hostile natal environments. In contrast, the specific frequency, $T_{\rm N}$, is insensitive to assembly history because it primarily traces low-mass GCs that tend to be disrupted soon after their formation. The promotion of GC formation and disruption by major mergers imprints a lasting and potentially observable signature: an elevated mass fraction of field stars in the galaxy's stellar halo that were born in star clusters.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and black holes from the phase transition in models of dynamical symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theories of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking predict a strong first order cosmological phase transition: we compute the resulting signals, primordial black holes and gravitational waves. These theories employ one SM-neutral scalar, plus some extra model-dependent particle to get the desired quantum potential out of classical scale invariance. We consider models where the extra particle is a scalar singlet, or vectors of an extended U(1) or SU(2) gauge sector. In models where the extra particle is stable, it provides a particle Dark Matter candidate with freeze-out abundance that tends to dominate over primordial black holes. These can instead be DM in models without a particle DM candidate. Gravitational waves arise at a level observable in future searches, even in regions where DM cannot be directly tested.</description>

      <title>GLoW: novel methods for wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing occur when the signal's wavelength is commensurate to the gravitational radius of the lens. Although potentially detectable in lensed gravitational waves, fast radio bursts and pulsars, accurate numerical predictions are challenging to compute. Here we present novel methods for wave-optics lensing that allow the treatment of general lenses. In addition to a general algorithm, specialized methods optimize symmetric lenses (arbitrary number of images) and generic lenses in the single-image regime. We also develop approximations for simple lenses (point-like and singular isothermal sphere) that drastically outperform known solutions without compromising accuracy. These algorithms are implemented in Gravitational Lensing of Waves (GLoW): an accurate, flexible, and fast code. GLoW efficiently computes the frequency-dependent amplification factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters in O(1 ms) to O(10 ms) depending on the lens configuration and complexity. GLoW is readily applicable to model lensing diffraction on gravitational-wave signals, offering new means to investigate the distribution of dark-matter and large-scale structure with signals from ground and space detectors.</description>

      <title>First direct carbon abundance measured at $z&gt;10$ in the lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the metal enrichment in the early universe helps us constrain theories about the first stars and study the ages of galaxies. The lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD at $z=10.17$ is the brightest galaxy known at $z &gt; 10$. Previous work analyzing JWST NIRSpec and MIRI data yielded a direct metallicity $\rm{12+log(O/H)}=7.79\pm0.09$ ($\sim$ 0.13 $Z_\odot$) and electron density $\rm{log}(n_e / \rm{cm^{-3}}) = 2.9 \pm 0.5$, the most distant such measurements to date. Here we estimate the direct C/O abundance for the first time at $z &gt; 10$, finding a sub-solar ${\rm log(C/O)}=-0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. This is higher than other $z&gt;6$ galaxies with direct C/O measurements, likely due to higher metallicity. It is also slightly higher than galaxies in the local universe with similar metallicity. This may suggest a very efficient and rapid burst of star formation, a low effective oxygen abundance yield, or the presence of unusual stellar populations including supermassive stars. Alternatively, the strong CIII]${\rm {\lambda}{\lambda}}$1907,1909 emission ($14\pm 3\,{\r{A}}$ rest-frame EW) may originate from just one of the two component star clusters JDB ($r \sim 20$ pc). Future NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations of MACS0647$-$JD will be promising for disentangling C/O in the two components to constrain the chemistry of individual star clusters just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The Dispersion Relation of Massive Photons in Plasma: A Comment on "Bounding the Photon Mass with Ultrawide Bandwidth Pulsar Timing Data and Dedispersed Pulses of Fast Radio Bursts"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measures of fast radio bursts have been identified as a powerful tool for testing the zero-mass hypothesis of the photon. The classical approach treats the massive photon-induced and plasma-induced time delays as two separate phenomena. Recently, Wang et al. (2024) suggested that the joint influence of the nonzero photon mass and plasma effects should be considered, and proposed a revised time delay for massive photons propagating in a plasma medium, denoted as $\Delta t'_{m_{\gamma}} \propto \nu^{-4}$, which departures from the classical dispersion relation ($\propto \nu^{-2}$). Here we discuss the derivation presented by Wang et al. (2024) and show that the classical dispersion relation remains valid based on Proca equations.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter and the thermal history of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metric $f(R)$ gravity minimally coupled to the Standard Model, the scalaron could act as dark matter if its mass falls within the range $4.4~\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim 1.2~\text{MeV}$. The dynamics of the scalaron in the universe is influenced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor. In our previous studies, we focused on the classical contribution to this trace generated by the Higgs field. At the onset of the electroweak crossover, its evolution is nonadiabatic with respect to the scalaron mass, and the scalaron experiences a perturbation that can trigger its oscillations. However, the trace of the stress-energy tensor also includes a time-dependent component due to the QCD trace anomaly. In this paper, we revisit the cosmological scenario for scalaron evolution by incorporating the trace anomaly at high temperatures. We show that, while this anomaly produces a shift in the equilibrium value of the scalaron, the evolution of this shift remains adiabatic with respect to the rapid oscillations of the scalaron. Consequently, possible cosmological scenarios for the scalaron evolution are qualitatively unaffected by this correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05329v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate primordial magnetogenesis within a quantum bouncing model driven by a scalar field, focusing on various non-minimal couplings between the electromagnetic field and the scalar field. We test three cases: no coupling, a Cauchy coupling with gradual decay, and a Gaussian coupling with rapid fall-off. By exploring these scenarios, we assess a wide range of coupling strengths across different scales. The scalar field, with an exponential potential, behaves as pressureless matter in the asymptotic past of the contracting phase, as stiff matter around the bounce, and as dark energy during the expanding phase. Our findings reveal that, among the tested cases, only the Gaussian coupling can explain the generation of primordial magnetic fields on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole (PBH) formation, at least during radiation domination. We identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric in the long-wavelength limit. Furthermore, we discover that it reaches its maximum value of 1/2 at extremal surfaces on the constant-time spacelike hypersurface, which simultaneously are bifurcating trapping horizons and admit circular photon orbits in the static spacetime. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function measures how close the positively curved region is to a type II configuration, with extremal surfaces where the value reaches 1/2.</description>

Abstract: We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the infrared PAH bands in the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of local AGN from the GATOS Survey. In this work, we examine the PAH properties in the circumnuclear regions of AGN and AGN-outflows, and compare them to those in star-forming regions and the innermost regions of AGN. This study employs 4.9-28.1 micron sub-arcsecond angular resolution data to investigate the properties of PAH in three nearby sources (DL~30-40 Mpc). Our findings align with previous JWST studies, showing that the central regions of AGN show a larger fraction of neutral PAH molecules (i.e. elevated 11.3/6.2 and 11.3/7.7 PAH ratios) compared to star-forming galaxies. We find that the AGN might affect not only the PAH population in the innermost region but also in the extended regions up to ~kpc scales. By comparing our observations to PAH diagnostic diagrams, we find that, in general, regions located in the projected direction of the AGN-outflow occupy similar positions on the PAH diagnostic diagrams as those of the innermost regions of AGN. Star-forming regions that are not affected by the AGN in these galaxies share the same part of the diagram as Star-forming galaxies. We examine the potential of the PAH-H2 diagram to disentangle AGN versus star-forming activity. Our results suggest that in Sy-like AGN, illumination and feedback from the AGN might affect the PAH population at nuclear and kpc scales, in particular, the ionization state of the PAH grains. However, PAH sizes are rather similar. The carriers of the ionized PAH bands (6.2 and 7.7 micron) are less resilience than those of neutral PAH bands (11.3 micron), which might be particularly important for strongly AGN-host coupled systems. Therefore, caution must be applied when using PAH bands as star-formation rate indicators in these systems even at kpc scales, with the ionized ones being more affected by the AGN.</description>

      <title>The impact of feedback on the evolution of gas density profiles from galaxies to clusters: a universal fitting formula from the Simba suite of simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial distribution of gas within galactic haloes is connected to the star formation rate and the nature of baryon-driven feedback processes. Using six variants of the hydrodynamic simulation Simba, we study the impact of different stellar/AGN feedback prescriptions on the gas density profiles of haloes in the total mass range $10^{11} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\mathrm{200c}} &lt; 10^{14} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. We find that the radial profiles are well represented by a power law and that, for a fixed total halo mass, the slope and amplitude of such power law are generally weakly dependent on redshift. Once AGN-driven jets are activated in the simulation, the gas density profile of haloes with $M_{\rm 200c} \gtrsim 10^{13} \, \rm M_{\odot}$ declines more gently with radial distance. We argue that this distinctive feature could be exploited with current observations to discriminate amongst the predictions of the different feedback models. We introduce a universal fitting formula for the slope and amplitude of the gas density profile as a function of total halo mass and redshift. The best-fit functions are suitable for all feedback variants considered, and their predictions are in excellent agreement with the numerical results. We provide the values of all fit parameters, making our fitting formula a versatile tool to mimic the effect of Simba feedback models onto N-body simulations and semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. Our results can also aid observational estimates of the gas mass within haloes that assume a specific slope for the underlying gas density profile.</description>

      <title>QCD-sourced tachyonic phase transition in a supercooled Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel gravitational wave production mechanism in the context of quasi-conformal Standard Model extensions, which provide a way to dynamically generate the electroweak scale. In these models, the cosmic thermal history is modified by a substantial period of thermal inflation, potentially supercooling the Universe below the QCD scale. The exit from supercooling is typically realized through a strong, first-order phase transition. By employing the classically conformal $U(1)_{\tiny\rm B-L}$ model as a representative example, we show that a large parameter space exists where bubble percolation is inefficient. Instead, the top quark condensate triggers a tachyonic phase transition driven by classical rolling of the new scalar field towards the true vacuum. As the field crosses a region where its effective mass is negative, long-wavelength scalar field fluctuations are exponentially amplified, preheating the supercooled Universe. We study the dynamics of this scenario and estimate the peak of the associated gravitational wave signal, which is detectable by future observatories in almost the entire available parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the spherical collapse approach, we investigate the impact of two alternative dark matter models, each characterized by distinct non-zero equations of state, one constant and the other time dependent on the nonlinear regime. Specifically, we compare these models to standard cold dark matter (CDM) by analyzing their influence on the linear density threshold for nonrelativistic component collapse and virial overdensity. Additionally, we explore the number count of collapsed objects, or dark matter halos, analogous to the number count of galaxy clusters. Finally, in light of recent discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), indicating the potential for more efficient early galaxy formation at higher redshifts, we investigate how alternative dark matter assumptions can enhance structure formation efficiency during the early universe.</description>

      <title>Coexistence Test of Primordial Black Holes and Particle Dark Matter from Diffractive Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If dark matter (DM) consists of primordial black holes (PBHs) and particles simultaneously, PBHs are generically embedded within particle DM halos. Such ``dressed PBHs'' (dPBHs) are subject to modified constraints compared to PBHs and can contribute to significant DM abundance in the mass range $10^{-1} - 10^2 M_\odot$. We show that diffractive lensing of chirping gravitational waves (GWs) from binary mergers can not only discover, but can also identify dPBH lenses and discriminate them from bare PBHs on the event-by-event basis, with potential to definitively establish the coexistence of subdominant PBHs and particle DM.</description>

      <title>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Interpretation in Subsolar Mass Gravitational Wave Candidate SSM200308</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the recent second part of the third observation run by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, a candidate with sub-solar mass components was reported, which we labelled as SSM200308. This study investigates the premise that primordial black holes (PBHs), arising from Gaussian perturbation collapses, could explain SSM200308. Through Bayesian analysis, we obtain the primordial curvature power spectrum that leads to the merger rate of PBHs aligning with observational data as long as they constitute {$f_{\mathrm{PBH}}=5.66^{+58.68}_{-5.44}\times 10^{-2}$ } of the dark matter. However, while the gravitational wave (GW) background from binary PBH mergers is within current observational limits, the scalar-induced GWs associated with PBH formation exceed the constraints imposed by pulsar timing arrays, challenging the Gaussian perturbation collapse PBH model as the source of SSM200308.</description>

      <title>New measurements of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest continuum and effective optical depth with LyCAN and DESI Y1 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Lyman-$\alpha$ Continuum Analysis Network (LyCAN), a Convolutional Neural Network that predicts the unabsorbed quasar continuum within the rest-frame wavelength range of $1040-1600$ Angstroms based on the red side of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line ($1216-1600$ Angstroms). We developed synthetic spectra based on a Gaussian Mixture Model representation of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) coefficients. These coefficients were derived from high-resolution, low-redshift ($z&lt;0.2$) Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph quasar spectra. We supplemented this COS-based synthetic sample with an equal number of DESI Year 5 mock spectra. LyCAN performs extremely well on testing sets, achieving a median error in the forest region of 1.5% on the DESI mock sample, 2.0% on the COS-based synthetic sample, and 4.1% on the original COS spectra. LyCAN outperforms Principal Component Analysis (PCA)- and NMF-based prediction methods using the same training set by 40% or more. We predict the intrinsic continua of 83,635 DESI Year 1 spectra in the redshift range of $2.1 \leq z \leq 4.2$ and perform an absolute measurement of the evolution of the effective optical depth. This is the largest sample employed to measure the optical depth evolution to date. We fit a power-law of the form $\tau(z) = \tau_0 (1+z)^\gamma$ to our measurements and find $\tau_0 = (2.46 \pm 0.14)\times10^{-3}$ and $\gamma = 3.62 \pm 0.04$. Our results show particular agreement with high-resolution, ground-based observations around $z = 2$, indicating that LyCAN is able to predict the quasar continuum in the forest region with only spectral information outside the forest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore gravitational lensing using more realistic dark matter halo models, moving beyond the limitations of spherical-collapse approximations. Through analytical calculations employing various mass functions, we address critical factors often neglected in the standard Press-Schechter formalism, such as ellipsoidal collapse conditions, angular momentum dynamics, dynamical friction, and the cosmological constant. Our analysis incorporates two widely recognized halo density profiles, the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles considering both spherical and ellipsoidal-collapse scenarios. We provide detailed calculations of key gravitational lensing observables, including Einstein radii, lensing optical depths, and time delays, across a broad range of redshifts and masses using two different lensing models: the point mass and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) models. Our results show that using more realistic dark matter halo models enhances lensing effects compared to their spherical-collapse counterparts. Additionally, our analyses of lensing optical depths and time delays reveal distinct differences between the point mass and SIS lens models. These findings underscore the importance of using realistic halo descriptions instead of simplified approximations when modeling gravitational lensing, as this approach can more accurately capture the complex structures of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic strings that are attached to rapidly spinning black holes can extract significant amounts of rotational energy and angular momentum. Here we study the effect on primordial black holes, which are expected to form with one or more cosmic strings attached. Although large primordial black holes are predicted to rapidly spin up due to accretion soon after forming, we argue that cosmic strings will spin them down again. We show that if there are cosmic strings with tension greater than $10^{-20}$, the spins of large primordial black holes of mass greater than $30 M_\odot$ should consequently be observed to be near zero. We also investigate the effect on a supermassive black hole of capturing a cosmic string and the possibility of observing the subsequent spin down by its effect on a pulsar orbiting the black hole.</description>

      <title>Detecting Relativistic Doppler by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New data from ongoing galaxy surveys, such as the $Euclid$ satellite and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are expected to unveil physics on the largest scales of our universe. Dramatically affected by cosmic variance, these scales are of interest to large-scale structure studies as they exhibit relevant corrections due to general relativity (GR) in the $n$-point statistics of cosmological random fields. We focus on the relativistic, sample-dependent Doppler contribution to the observed clustering of galaxies, whose detection will further confirm the validity of GR in cosmological regimes. Sample- and scale-dependent, the Doppler term is more likely to be detected via cross-correlation measurements, where it acts as an imaginary correction to the power spectrum of fluctuations in galaxy number counts. We present a method allowing us to exploit multi-tracer benefits from a single data set, by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples, according to galaxies' luminosity/magnitude. To overcome cosmic variance we rely on a multi-tracer approach, and to maximise the detectability of the relativistic Doppler contribution in the data, we optimise sample selection. As a result, we find the optimal split and forecast the relativistic Doppler detection significance for both a DESI-like Bright Galaxy Sample and a $Euclid$-like H$\alpha$ galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Bounds on ultralight bosons from the Event Horizon Telescope observation of Sgr A$^*$</title>

Abstract: Recent observation of Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$) by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has uncovered various unanswered questions in black hole (BH) physics. Besides, it may also probe various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. One of the most profound possibilities is the search for ultralight bosons (ULBs) using BH superradiance (SR). EHT observations imply that Sgr A$^*$ has a non-zero spin. Using this observation, we derive bounds on the mass of ULBs with purely gravitational interactions. Considering self-interacting ultralight axions, we constrain new regions in the parameter space of decay constant, for a certain spin of Sgr A$^*$. Future observations of various spinning BHs can improve the present constraints on ULBs.</description>

Abstract: Several Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), which can unveil the formation of primordial seeds of inhomogeneities in the early universe. With the SGWB parameters inferred from PTAs data, we can make a prediction of the seeds for early galaxy formation from the domain walls in the axion-like particles (ALPs) field distribution. This also naturally provides a solution to the observation of high redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope. The predicted photon coupling of the ALP is within the reach of future experimental searches.</description>

Abstract: Atom and matter interferometers are precise quantum sensing experiments that can probe differential forces along separated spacetime paths. Various atom and matter interferometer experiments have been proposed to study dark matter, gravitational waves, and exotic new physics. Increasingly, these experimental concepts have proposed space-based designs to maximize interrogation times and baselines. However, decoherence and phase shifts caused by astrophysical backgrounds could largely undermine or destroy the target sensitivity of the experiments. We calculate the decoherence effects induced by solar photons, the solar wind, cosmic rays, solar neutrinos and zodiacal dust on space-based atom and matter interferometers. We find that, in future space-based atom and matter interferometers, the solar wind generically produces decoherence beyond the quantum noise limit, without proper shielding. In addition, solar photons are also an important background for matter interferometers.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Nulling and Vacuum Radio Emission from Axion Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-relativistic axions can be efficiently produced in in the polar caps of pulsars, resulting in the formation of a dense cloud of gravitationally bound axions. Here, we investigate the interplay between such an axion cloud and the electrodynamics in the pulsar magnetosphere, focusing specifically on the dynamics in the polar caps, where the impact of the axion cloud is expected to be most pronounced. For sufficiently light axions $m_a \lesssim 10^{-7}$ eV, we show that the axion cloud can occasionally screen the local electric field responsible for particle acceleration and pair production, inducing a periodic nulling of the pulsar's intrinsic radio emission. At larger axion masses, the small-scale fluctuations in the axion field tend to suppress the back-reaction of the axion on the electrodynamics; however, we point out that the incoherent oscillations of the axion in short-lived regions of vacuum near the neutron star surface can produce a narrow radio line, which provides a complementary source of radio emission to the plasma-resonant emission processes identified in previous work. While this work focuses on the leading order correction to pair production in the magnetosphere, we speculate that there can exist dramatic deviations in the electrodynamics of these systems when the axion back-reaction becomes non-linear.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays from dark matter spikes in EAGLE simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) with a mass range between $100 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ are expected to be surrounded by high dark matter densities, so-called dark matter spikes. The high density of self-annihilating Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in these spikes leads to copious gamma-ray production. Sufficiently nearby IMBHs could therefore appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources. However, the number of IMBHs and their distribution within our own Milky Way is currently unknown. In this work, we provide a mock catalogue of IMBHs and their dark matter spikes obtained from the EAGLE simulations, in which black holes with a mass of $10^5 \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ are seeded into the centre of halos greater than $10^{10} \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ to model black hole feedback influencing the formation of galaxies. The catalogue contains the coordinates and dark matter spike parameters for over 2500 IMBHs present in about 150 Milky Way-like galaxies. We expect about $15^{+9}_{-6}$ IMBHs within our own galaxy, mainly distributed in the Galactic Centre and the Galactic Plane. In the most optimistic scenario, we find that current and future gamma-ray observatories, such as Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. and CTAO, would be sensitive enough to probe the cross section of dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs down to many orders of magnitude below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter particles with masses from GeV to TeV. We have made the IMBH mock catalogue and the source code for our analysis publicly available, providing the resources to study dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs with current and upcoming gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multiband observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multiband observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16} $ to $10^{-15} {\rm eV}$, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the millihertz band observations alone. Multiband observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by at most 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multiband observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>

Abstract: We give a detailed canonical analysis of the $n$-dimensional $f$(Riemann) gravity, correcting the earlier results in the literature. We also write the field equations in the Fischer-Marsden form which is amenable to identifying the non-stationary energy on a spacelike hypersurface.

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and Green's functions in black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal interactions play a crucial role in deciphering gravitational wave signals emitted by the coalescence of binary systems. They are usually quantified by a set of complex coefficients which include tidal Love numbers, describing the conservative response to an external perturbation. In the static case, these are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity in four spacetime dimensions, and recently they have been generalized to dynamical interactions. In the context of response theory, the retarded Green's function provides the complete description of the behavior of dynamical systems. In this work we investigate the relation between Love numbers and Green's functions, and highlight the relevance of radiation reaction effects to their connection. As a special case, we discuss Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes, where the absence of radiative modes allows us to make a direct link between them.</description>

      <title>Constraining viscous-fluid models in $f(Q)$ gravity using cosmic measurements and large-scale structure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the effects of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various toy models of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law ($f_{1\rm{CDM}}$), exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$), and logarithmic ($f_{3\rm{CDM}}$) are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these models, we use 57 Hubble parameter data points (OHD), 1048 supernovae distance modulus (SNIa), their combined analysis (OHD+SNIa), 14 growth rate ($f$-data), and 30 redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m, H_0$ and exponents $\{n, p, \gamma\}$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta_0$, through a detailed statistical analysis. Moreover, we study linear cosmological perturbations and compute the density contrast \(\delta(z)\), growth factor $D(z)$, growth rate $(f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with \lcdm is made. From our statistical analysis of cosmic measurements, we found an underestimation of all models on the OHD data; therefore, statistical viability led us to weigh it in favour of SNIa data which resulted in the exponential ($f_{2\rm{CDM}}$) model without bulk viscosity being the most plausible alternative model, while on average the $f_{1\rm{CDM}}$ model performed statistically the weakest. We also found that adding bulk viscosity did not improve the fit of the models to all observational data.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>
