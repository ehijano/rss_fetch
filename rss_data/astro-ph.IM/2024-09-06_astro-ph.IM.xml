      <title>Optical sensitivities of current gravitational wave observatories at higher kHz, MHz and GHz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GEO 600, Kagra, LIGO, and Virgo were built to observe gravitational waves at frequencies in the audio band, where the highest event rates combined with the largest signal to noise ratios had been predicted. Currently, hypothetical sources of cosmological origin that could have produced signals at higher frequencies are under discussion. What is not widely known is that current interferometric GW observatories have a frequency comb of high optical sensitivity that encompasses these high frequencies. Here we calculate the high-frequency noise spectral densities of operating GW observatories under the justified assumption that photon shot noise is the dominant noise source. We explain the underlying physics of why high sensitivity is achieved for all integer multiples of the free spectral ranges of the observatory's resonators when an interferometer arm is not orientated perpendicular to the propagation direction of the GW. Proposals for new concepts of high-frequency GW detectors must be compared with the high-frequency sensitivities presented here.</description>

      <title>Toward a universal characterization methodology for conversion gain measurement of CMOS APS: application to Euclid and SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the expanding integration of infrared instruments in astronomical missions, accurate per-pixel flux estimation for near-infrared hybrid detectors has become critical to the success of these missions. Based on CPPM's involvement in both SVOM/Colibri and Euclid missions, this study introduces universally applicable methods and framework for characterizing IR hybrid detectors and decorrelating their intrinsic properties. The characterization framework, applied to the ALFA detector and \Euclid's H2RG, not only validates the proposed methods but also points out subtle behaviors inherent to each detector.</description>

      <title>Mid-order wavefront control for exoplanet imaging: preliminary characterization of the segmented deformable mirror and Zernike wavefront sensor on HiCAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mid-order wavefront sensor (MOWFS) to address fine cophasing errors in exoplanet imaging with future large segmented aperture space telescopes. Observing Earth analogs around Sun-like stars requires contrasts down to $10^{-10}$ in visible light. One promising solution consists of producing a high-contrast dark zone in the image of an observed star. In a space observatory, this dark region will be altered by several effects, and among them, the small misalignments of the telescope mirror segments due to fine thermo-mechanical drifts. To correct for these errors in real time, we investigate a wavefront control loop based on a MOWFS with a Zernike sensor. Such a MOWFS was installed on the high-contrast imager for complex aperture telescopes (HiCAT) testbed in Baltimore in June 2023. The bench uses a 37-segment Iris-AO deformable mirror to mimic telescope segmentation and some wavefront control strategies to produce a dark zone with such an aperture. In this contribution, we first use the MOWFS to characterize the Iris-AO segment discretization steps. For the central segment, we find a minimal step of 125\,$\pm$31\,pm. This result will help us to assess the contribution of the Iris-AO DM on the contrast in HiCAT. We then determine the detection limits of the MOWFS, estimating wavefront error amplitudes of 119 and 102\,pm for 10\,s and 1\,min exposure time with a SNR of 3. These values inform us about the measurement capabilities of our wavefront sensor on the testbed. These preliminary results will be useful to provide insights on metrology and stability for exo-Earth observations with the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Strengthening leverage of Astroinformatics in inter-disciplinary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most domains of science are experiencing a paradigm shift due to the advent of a new generation of instruments and detectors which produce data and data streams at an unprecedented rate. The scientific exploitation of these data, namely Data Driven Discovery, requires interoperability, massive and optimal use of Artificial Intelligence methods in all steps of the data acquisition, processing and analysis, the access to large and distributed computing HPC facilities, the implementation and access to large simulations and interdisciplinary skills that usually are not provided by standard academic curricula. Furthermore, to cope with this data deluge, most communities have leveraged solutions and tools originally developed by large corporations for purposes other than scientific research and accepted compromises to adapt them to their specific needs. Through the presentation of several astrophysical use cases, we show how the Data Driven based solutions could represent the optimal playground to achieve the multi-disciplinary methodological approach.</description>

      <title>Photonic beam-combiner for visible interferometry with SCExAO/FIRST: laboratory characterization and design optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated optics are used to achieve astronomical interferometry inside robust and compact materials, improving the instrument's stability and sensitivity. In order to perform differential phase measurements at the H$\alpha$ line (656.3 nm) with the 600-800 nm spectro-interferometer FIRST, a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) is being developed in collaboration with TEEM Photonics. This PIC performs the interferometric combination of the beams coming from sub-apertures selected in the telescope pupil, thus implementing the pupil remapping technique to restore the diffraction limit of the telescope. In this work, we report on the latest developments carried out within the FIRST project to produce a high performance visible PIC. The PICs are manufactured by TEEM Photonics, using their technology based on $K_+:Na_+$ ion exchange in glass. The first part of the study consists in the experimental characterization of the fundamental properties of the waveguides, in order to build an accurate model, which is the basis for the design of more complex functions. In the second part, theoretical designs and their optimization for three types of combiner architectures are presented: symmetric directional coupler, asymmetric directional couplers and ABCD cells including achromatic phase shifters.</description>

      <title>ESCAPE project: fundamental detection limits of JWST/NIRCam coronographic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explored the fundamental contrast limit of NIRCam coronagraphy observations, representing the achievable performance with post-processing techniques. This limit is influenced by photon noise and readout noise, with complex noise propagation through post-processing methods like principal component analysis. We employed two approaches: developing a formula based on simplified scenarios and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, assuming Gaussian noise properties and uncorrelated pixel noise. Tested on datasets HIP\,65426, AF\,Lep, and HD\,114174, the MCMC method provided accurate but computationally intensive estimates. The analytical approach offered quick, reliable estimates closely matching MCMC results in simpler scenarios. Our findings showed the fundamental contrast curve is significantly deeper than the current achievable contrast limit obtained with post-processing techniques at shorter separations, being 10 times deeper at $0.5''$ and 4 times deeper at $1''$. At greater separations, increased exposure time improves sensitivity, with the transition between photon and readout noise dominance occurring between $2''$ and $3''$. We conclude the analytical approach is a reliable estimate of the fundamental contrast limit, offering a faster alternative to MCMC. These results emphasize the potential for greater sensitivity at shorter separations, highlighting the need for improved or new post-processing techniques to enhance JWST NIRCam sensitivity or contrast curve.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Lyapunov-Based Eclipse-Feasible Low-Thrust Transfer Trajectories to NRHO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating low-thrust transfer trajectories between Earth and the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), that is selected for NASA's Gateway, can be challenging due to the low control authority available from the propulsion system and the important operational constraint that the duration of all eclipses has to be less than a prescribed 90-minute threshold. We present a method for generating eclipse-feasible, minimum-time solutions to the aforementioned trajectory design problem using a Lyapunov control law. Coasting is enforced during solar eclipses due to both the Earth and Moon. We used particle swarm optimization to optimize the NRHO insertion date, time of flight, and control law parameters according to a cost function that prioritizes 1) convergence to the target orbit, 2) satisfaction of eclipse-duration constraints, and 3) minimization of time of flight. Trajectories can serve as initial guesses for NASA's high-fidelity trajectory design tools such as Copernicus and GMAT.</description>

      <title>Strategy for mitigation of systematics for EoR experiments with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the 21 cm signal face significant challenges due to bright astrophysical foregrounds that are several orders of magnitude higher than the brightness of the hydrogen line, along with various systematics. Successful 21 cm experiments require accurate calibration and foreground mitigation. Errors introduced during the calibration process such as systematics, can disrupt the intrinsic frequency smoothness of the foregrounds, leading to power leakage into the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) window. Therefore, it is essential to develop strategies to effectively address these challenges. In this work, we adopt a stringent approach to identify and address suspected systematics, including malfunctioning antennas, frequency channels corrupted by radio frequency interference (RFI), and other dominant effects. We implement a statistical framework that utilises various data products from the data processing pipeline to derive specific criteria and filters. These criteria and filters are applied at intermediate stages to mitigate systematic propagation from the early stages of data processing. Our analysis focuses on observations from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase I configuration. Out of the observations processed by the pipeline, our approach selects 18%, totalling 58 hours, that exhibit fewer systematic effects. The successful selection of observations with reduced systematic dominance enhances our confidence in achieving 21 cm measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars play a decisive role in our Universe, from its beginning throughout its complete evolution. For a thorough understanding of their properties, evolution, and physics of their outer envelopes, stellar spectra need to be analyzed by comparison with numerical models of their atmospheres. We discuss the foundations of how to calculate such models (in particular, density and temperature stratification, affected by convective energy transport in low-mass stars), which requires a parallel treatment of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics and radiative transfer. We stress the impact of emissivities, opacities, and particularly their ratio (source function), and summarize how these quantities are calculated, either adopting or relaxing the assumption of LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium). Subsequently, we discuss the influence and physics of stellar winds (and their various driving mechanisms as a function of stellar type), rotation, magnetic fields, inhomogeneities, and multiplicity. Finally, we outline the basics of quantitative spectroscopy, namely how to analyze observed spectra in practice.</description>

      <title>On-orbit calibration and long-term performance of the DAMPE trigger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a satellite-borne particle detector for measurements of high-energy cosmic rays and {\gamma}-rays. DAMPE has been operating smoothly in space for more than 8 years since launch on December 17, 2015. The trigger logic of DAMPE is designed according to the deposited energy information recorded by the calorimeter. The precise calibration of the trigger thresholds and their long-term evolutions are very important for the scientific analysis of DAMPE. In this work, we develop a new method for the threshold calibration, considering the influence from the electronic noise, and obtain the long-term evolutions of the trigger thresholds. The average increase rate of the trigger thresholds for the first 4 layers of the calorimeter is found to be about 0.9% per year, resulting in variations of the high-energy trigger efficiency of cosmic ray electrons by about -5% per year at 2 GeV and less than about -0.05% above 30 GeV.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Completeness of Accreting Neutron Star Binary Candidates from the Chinese Space Station Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) has many extreme physical conditions, and one may obtain some important informations about NS via accreting neutron star binary (ANSB) systems. The upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) provides an opportunity to search for a large sample of ANSB candidates. Our goal is to check the completeness of the potential ANSB samples from CSST data. In this paper, we generate some ANSBs and normal binaries under CSST photometric system by binary evolution and binary population synthesis method and use a machine learning method to train a classification model. Although the Precision ($94.56~ \%$) of our machine learning model is as high as before study, the Recall is only about $63.29~ \%$. The Precision/Recall is mainly determined by the mass transfer rate between the NSs and their companions. In addition, we also find that the completeness of ANSB samples from CSST photometric data by the machine learning method also depends on the companion mass and the age of the system. ANSB candidates with low initial mass companion star ($0.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $1~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have a relatively high Precision ($94.94~ \%$) and high Recall ($86.32~ \%$), whereas ANSB candidates with higher initial mass companion star ($1.1~ {\rm M}_\odot$ to $3~ {\rm M}_\odot$) have similar Precision ($93.88~ \%$) and quite low Recall ($42.67~ \%$). Our results indicate that although the machine learning method may obtain a relative pure sample of ANSBs, a completeness correction is necessary for one to obtain a complete sample.</description>

      <title>Panopticon: a novel deep learning model to detect single transit events with no prior data filtering in PLATO light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To prepare for the analyses of the future PLATO light curves, we develop a deep learning model, Panopticon, to detect transits in high precision photometric light curves. Since PLATO's main objective is the detection of temperate Earth-size planets around solar-type stars, the code is designed to detect individual transit events. The filtering step, required by conventional detection methods, can affect the transit, which could be an issue for long and shallow transits. To protect transit shape and depth, the code is also designed to work on unfiltered light curves. We trained the model on a set of simulated PLATO light curves in which we injected, at pixel level, either planetary, eclipsing binary, or background eclipsing binary signals. We also include a variety of noises in our data, such as granulation, stellar spots or cosmic rays. The approach is able to recover 90% of our test population, including more than 25% of the Earth-analogs, even in the unfiltered light curves. The model also recovers the transits irrespective of the orbital period, and is able to retrieve transits on a unique event basis. These figures are obtained when accepting a false alarm rate of 1%. When keeping the false alarm rate low (&lt;0.01%), it is still able to recover more than 85% of the transit signals. Any transit deeper than 180ppm is essentially guaranteed to be recovered. This method is able to recover transits on a unique event basis, and does so with a low false alarm rate. Thanks to light curves being one-dimensional, model training is fast, on the order of a few hours per model. This speed in training and inference, coupled to the recovery effectiveness and precision of the model make it an ideal tool to complement, or be used ahead of, classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Ensemble noise properties of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over the uncertainties in pulsar noise priors. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.</description>

      <title>Score-matching neural networks for improved multi-band source separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a score-matching neural network that represents a data-driven prior for non-parametric galaxy morphologies. The gradients of this prior can be incorporated in the optimization of galaxy models to aid with tasks like deconvolution, inpainting or source separation. We demonstrate this approach with modification of the multi-band modeling framework Scarlet that is currently employed as deblending method in the pipelines of the HyperSuprimeCam survey and the Rubin Observatory. The addition of the prior avoids the requirement of non-differentiable constraints, which can lead to convergence failures we discovered in Scarlet. We present the architecture and training details of our score-matching neural network and show with simulated Rubin-like observations that using a data-driven prior outperforms the baseline \scarlet method in accuracy of total flux and morphology estimates, while maintaining excellent performance for colors. We also demonstrate significant improvements in the robustness to inaccurate initializations. The trained score models used for this analysis are publicly available at https://github.com/SampsonML/galaxygrad.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model reconstruction based on spectral line observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral line observations encode a wealth of information. A key challenge, therefore, lies in the interpretation of these observations in terms of models to derive the physical and chemical properties of the astronomical environments from which they arise. In this paper, we present pomme: an open-source Python package that allows users to retrieve 1D or 3D models of physical properties, such as chemical abundance, velocity, and temperature distributions of (optically thin) astrophysical media, based on spectral line observations. We discuss how prior knowledge, for instance, in the form of a steady-state hydrodynamics model, can be used to guide the retrieval process, and demonstrate our methods both on synthetic and real observations of cool stellar winds.</description>

      <title>An image-based blind search for Fast Radio Bursts in 88 hours of data from the EoR0 Field, with the Murchison Widefield Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is part of ongoing efforts to detect Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in a spectral window below 300 MHz. We used an image-based method based on the pilot study of Tingay et al. 2015, scaled up via massively parallel processing using a commercial supercomputer. We searched 87.6 hours of 2-second snapshot images, each covering 1165 square degrees of the EoR0 field, over a dispersion measure range of 170 to 1035 pc cm$^{-3}$. The large amount of data necessitated the construction of a series of filters to classify and reject the large number of false positives. Our search was more sensitive than any previous blind search using the MWA telescope, but we report no FRB detections, a result which is consistent with the extrapolation into the low-frequency domain of the results of Sokolowski et al. (2024). We obtain upper bounds on the event rate ranging from &lt;1783 sky$^{-1}$day$^{-1}$ at a fluence of 392 Jy ms, to &lt;31 sky$^{-1}$day$^{-1}$ at 8400 Jy ms, for our spectral window of 167-198 MHz. Our method was shown to be computationally efficient and scalable by the two or three orders of magnitude required to seriously test the model of Sokolowski et al. Our process is especially sensitive to detections of satellites and meteor trails and may find applications in the identification of these transients. We comment on future surveys using this method, with both the MWA and the SKA.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) Collaboration -- Contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) is an envisioned observatory of ultra-high-energy particles of cosmic origin, with energies in excess of 100 PeV. GRAND uses large surface arrays of autonomous radio-detection units to look for the radio emission from extensive air showers that are triggered by the interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, gamma rays, and neutrinos in the atmosphere or underground. In particular, for ultra-high-energy neutrinos, the future final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to discover them in spite of their plausibly tiny flux. Presently, three prototype GRAND radio arrays are in operation: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and GRAND@Nancay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the design of the radio-detection units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2023) presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a look at the first data collected by GRANDProto13, the first phase of GRANDProto300.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluated the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>
