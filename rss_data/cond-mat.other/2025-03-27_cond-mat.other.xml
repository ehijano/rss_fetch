      <title>Topological states in one-dimensional $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a closed form expression for the energy spectrum of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric superlattice systems with complex potentials of periodic sets of two $\delta$-potentials in the elementary cell. In the presence of periodic gain and loss we analyzed in detail a diatomic crystal model, varying either the scatterer distances or the potential heights. It is shown that at a certain critical value of the imaginary part of the complex amplitude, topological states depending on the lattice size and the configuration of the unit cell can disappear. This may happened at the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking (exceptional) points.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>Edelstein Effect in Isotropic and Anisotropic Rashba Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-to-charge conversion via the Edelstein effect in a 2D Rashba electron gas using the semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We analyze the magnetization arising from the direct Edelstein effect, taking into account an anisotropic Rashba model. We study how this effect depends on the effective masses and Rashba spin--orbit coupling parameters, extracting analytical expressions for the high electronic density regime. {Indeed, it is possible to manipulate the anisotropy introduced into the system through these parameters to achieve a boost in the Edelstein response compared to the isotropic Rashba model.} We also discuss the theoretical framework to study the inverse Edelstein effect and calculate self-consistently the electric current induced by the proximity of the system to a ferromagnet. These results provide insights into the role of Rashba spin--orbit coupling and anisotropic effects in spin--charge conversion phenomena.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent spin-resolved electronic structure of ferromagnetic triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution angle- and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of the triple-layered ruthenate Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ reveals features of the electronic structure that extend our understanding of the layered strontium ruthenates. The spectra near the Fermi energy are very different from the non-magnetic analogues Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ with distinct Fermi surfaces for wide electron-like minority spin bands around the zone center and narrow hole-like majority spin Fermi surface contours around the zone corners. The most dramatic results are two narrow spectral peaks $\sim$30 meV below the Fermi-level, a spin-minority hole-like band at the Brillouin zone center, and a spin-majority saddle-band van Hove singularity at the zone edge, which exhibits almost 100\% spin-polarization at low temperature, and a strong temperature dependent coherence-incoherence crossover attributed to Hund metal correlations. Quantitative comparison of the ARPES to spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations identify the specific antibonding and nonbonding orbital origins of the narrow bands, with a prediction of different spatial localization in the central and outer layers. This is shown to be consistent with experimental ARPES multi-zone matrix element intensity variations, and implicates outer-layer-specific control of the in-plane metamagnetism. The renormalization of the bands relative to the mean-field DFT, the demonstration of spin-polarized oxygen bands, and of spin-minority and spin-majority band-crossing hybridization, provide a more complete picture of the magnetism which displays aspects of both delocalized and local moment behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural, electronic, vibrational, optical, piezoelectric, thermal and thermoelectric properties of BCZT from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perovskite material such as BCZT (Ba$_{0.875}$Ca$_{0.125}$(Zr$_{0.125}$Ti$_{0.875}$)O$_{3}$) is well known for its high value of piezoceramic properties and Curie temperature which has potential applications in sensors, actuators, optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Based on its composition and physical parameters such as pressure and temperature, experimentally, BCZT shows different crystal structures (rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic) with multiferroic properties. Here, we have designed these materials by comparing experimental stoichiometry and evaluated their stability by calculating the tolerance factor, formation energy, and cohesive energy. The structural, electronic and vibrational properties of BCZT are explored using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory. We have also shown variation of piezoelectric and optical properties through multiple phases using time dependent density functional theory. The electronic band gap, optical response in the visible light range, as well as piezoelectric, electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties, demonstrate excellent characteristics, making this material a promising lead-free ferroelectric candidate for various energy harvesting applications. Boltzmann transport theory is used for the calculation of Seebeck coefficient, electron thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to estimate the power factor and figure of merit which represents the efficiency of the material. The high values at the Fermi level suggest that these materials are well-suited for future device applications.</description>
