      <title>From Risk Perception to Behavior Large Language Models-Based Simulation of Pandemic Prevention Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual prevention behaviors are a primary line of defense during the early stages of novel infectious disease outbreaks, yet their adoption is heterogeneous and difficult to forecast-especially when empirical data are scarce and epidemic-policy contexts evolve rapidly. To address this gap, we develop an LLM-based prevention-behavior simulation framework that couples (i) a static module for behavior-intensity prediction under a specified external context and (ii) a dynamic module that updates residents' perceived risk over time and propagates these updates into behavior evolution. The model is implemented via structured prompt engineering in a first-person perspective and is evaluated against two rounds of survey data from Beijing residents (R1: December 2020; R2: August 2021) under progressively realistic data-availability settings: zero-shot, few-shot, and cross-context transfer. Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare simulated and observed behavior distributions (p &gt; 0.001 as the validity criterion), the framework demonstrates robust performance and improves with limited reference examples; reported predictive accuracy increases from 72.7% (zero-shot) to 81.8% (few-shot), and remains high at 77.8% under transfer to novel contexts. We further apply the framework to simulate behavior changes during China's December 2022 policy relaxation and to stress-test behavioral responses across 120 systematically varied epidemic conditions (R0, CFR, and control-measure tiers). Results indicate broad behavioral loosening under relaxation but a distinctive counter-trend increase in drain-related disinfection, highlighting how low-cost, low-friction behaviors may persist or intensify even when external constraints recede-raising a potential environmental tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ways in which people's opinions change are, without a doubt, subject to a rich tapestry of differing influences. Factors that affect how one arrives at an opinion reflect how they have been shaped by their environment throughout their lives, education, material status, what belief systems are they subscribed to, and what socio-economic minorities are they a part of. This already complex system is further expanded by the ever-changing nature of one's social network. It is therefore no surprise that many models have a tendency to perform best for the majority of the population and discriminating those people who are members of various marginalized groups . This bias and the study of how to counter it are subject to a rapidly developing field of Fairness in Social Network Analysis (SNA). The focus of this work is to look into how a state-of-the-art model discriminates certain minority groups and whether it is possible to reliably predict for whom it will perform worse. Moreover, is such prediction possible based solely on one's demographic or topological features? To this end, the NetSense dataset, together with a state-of-the-art CoDiNG model for opinion prediction have been employed. Our work explores how three classifier models (Demography-Based, Topology-Based, and Hybrid) perform when assessing for whom this algorithm will provide inaccurate predictions. Finally, through a comprehensive analysis of these experimental results, we identify four key patterns of algorithmic bias. Our findings suggest that no single paradigm provides the best results and that there is a real need for context-aware strategies in fairness-oriented social network analysis. We conclude that a multi-faceted approach, incorporating both individual attributes and network structures, is essential for reducing algorithmic bias and promoting inclusive decision-making.</description>

      <title>Celebrity messages reduce online hate and limit its spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online hate spreads rapidly, yet little is known about whether preventive and scalable strategies can curb it. We conducted the largest randomized controlled trial of hate speech prevention to date: a 20-week messaging campaign on X in Nigeria targeting ethnic hate. 73,136 users who had previously engaged with hate speech were randomly assigned to receive prosocial video messages from Nigerian celebrities. The campaign reduced hate content by 2.5% to 5.5% during treatment, with about 75% of the reduction persisting over the following four months. Reaching a larger share of a user's audience reduced amplification of that user's hate posts among both treated and untreated users, cutting hate reposts by over 50% for the most exposed accounts. Scalable messaging can limit online hate without removing content.</description>

      <title>Counting hypertriangles through hypergraph orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting the number of small patterns is a central task in network analysis. While this problem is well studied for graphs, many real-world datasets are naturally modeled as hypergraphs, motivating the need for efficient hypergraph motif counting algorithms. In particular, we study the problem of counting hypertriangles - collections of three pairwise-intersecting hyperedges. These hypergraph patterns have a rich structure with multiple distinct intersection patterns unlike graph triangles.
  Inspired by classical graph algorithms based on orientations and degeneracy, we develop a theoretical framework that generalizes these concepts to hypergraphs and yields provable algorithms for hypertriangle counting. We implement these ideas in DITCH (Degeneracy Inspired Triangle Counter for Hypergraphs) and show experimentally that it is 10-100x faster and more memory efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>S2Vec: Self-Supervised Geospatial Embeddings for the Built Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable general-purpose representations of the built environment are crucial for geospatial artificial intelligence applications. This paper introduces S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate S2Vec on several large-scale geospatial prediction tasks, both random train/test splits (interpolation) and zero-shot geographic adaptation (extrapolation). Our experiments show S2Vec's competitive performance against several baselines on socioeconomic tasks, especially the geographic adaptation variant, with room for improvement on environmental tasks. We also explore combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve performance. Our findings highlight how S2Vec can learn effective general-purpose geospatial representations of the built environment features it is provided, and how it can complement other data modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Towards a valid bibliometric measure of epistemic breadth of researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of epistemic breadth of the work of a researcher refers to the scope of their knowledge claims, as reflected in published research reports. Studies of epistemic breadth have been hampered by the lack of a validated measure of the concept. Here we introduce a knowledge space approach to the measurement of epistemic breadth and propose to use the semantic similarity network of an author's publication record to operationalize a measure. In this approach, each paper has its own location in a common abstract vector space based on its content. Proximity in knowledge space corresponds to thematic similarity of publications. Candidate measures of epistemic breadth derived from aggregate similarity values of researchers' bodies of work are tested against external validation data of researchers known to have made a major change in research topic and against self-citation data. We find that some candidate measures co-vary well with known epistemic breadth of researchers in the empirical data and can serve as valid indicators of the concept.</description>

      <title>Mapping Regional Disparities in Discounted Grocery Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Food waste represents a major challenge to global climate resilience, accounting for almost 10% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. The retail sector is a critical player, mediating product flows between producers and consumers, where supply chain inefficiencies can shape which items are put on sale. Yet how these dynamics vary across geographic contexts remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze data from Denmark's largest retail group on near-expiry products put on sale. We uncover the geospatial variations using a dual-clustering approach. We characterize multi-scale spatial relationships in retail organization by correlating store clustering -- measured using shortest-path distances along the street network -- with product clustering based on promotion co-occurrence patterns. Using a bipartite network approach, we identify three regional store clusters, and use percolation thresholds to corroborate the scale of their spatial separation. We find that stores in rural communities put meat and dairy products on sale up to 2.2 times more frequently than metropolitan areas. In contrast, metropolitan and capital regions lean toward convenience products, which have more balanced nutritional profiles but less favorable environmental impacts. By linking geographic context to retail inventory, we provide evidence that reducing food waste requires interventions tailored to local retail dynamics, highlighting the importance of region-specific sustainability strategies.</description>
