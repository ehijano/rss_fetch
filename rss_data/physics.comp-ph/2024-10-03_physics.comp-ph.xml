      <title>Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.</description>

      <title>First-principles computational methods for quantum defects in two-dimensional materials: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum defects are atomic defects in materials that provide resources to construct quantum information devices such as single-photon emitters (SPEs) and spin qubits. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials gained prominence as a host of quantum defects with many attractive features derived from their atomically thin and layered material formfactor. In this perspective, we discuss first-principles computational methods and challenges to predict the spin and electronic properties of quantum defects in 2D materials. We focus on the open quantum system nature of the defects and their interaction with external parameters such as electric field, magnetic field, and lattice strain. We also discuss how such prediction and understanding can be used to guide experimental studies, ranging from defect identification to tuning of their spin and optical properties. This perspective provides significant insights into the interplay between the defect, the host material, and the environment, which will be essential in the pursuit of ideal two-dimensional quantum defect platforms.</description>

      <title>Response Estimation and System Identification of Dynamical Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modelling of structural dynamics is crucial across numerous engineering applications, such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), seismic analysis, and vibration control. Often, these models originate from physics-based principles and can be derived from corresponding governing equations, often of differential equation form. However, complex system characteristics, such as nonlinearities and energy dissipation mechanisms, often imply that such models are approximative and often imprecise. This challenge is further compounded in SHM, where sensor data is often sparse, making it difficult to fully observe the system's states. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a class of physics-enhanced machine learning (PEML) techniques, for the identification and estimation of dynamical systems. PINNs offer a unique advantage by embedding known physical laws directly into the neural network's loss function, allowing for simple embedding of complex phenomena, even in the presence of uncertainties. This study specifically investigates three key applications of PINNs: state estimation in systems with sparse sensing, joint state-parameter estimation, when both system response and parameters are unknown, and parameter estimation within a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainties. The results demonstrate that PINNs deliver an efficient tool across all aforementioned tasks, even in presence of modelling errors. However, these errors tend to have a more significant impact on parameter estimation, as the optimization process must reconcile discrepancies between the prescribed model and the true system behavior. Despite these challenges, PINNs show promise in dynamical system modeling, offering a robust approach to handling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>BullFrog: Multi-step perturbation theory as a time integrator for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the cosmic large-scale structure can be done through numerical N-body simulations or by using perturbation theory. Here, we present an N-body approach that effectively implements a multi-step forward model based on Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe. This is achieved by introducing the second-order accurate BullFrog integrator, which performs 2LPT time steps (before shell-crossing) to second order without requiring the explicit computation of 2LPT displacements, while the higher-order terms rapidly approach the exact solution as the number of time steps increases. As a validation test, we compare BullFrog against other N-body integrators and high-order LPT, both for a realistic $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and for simulations with a sharp UV cutoff in the initial conditions. The latter scenario enables controlled experiments against LPT and, in practice, is particularly relevant for modelling coarse-grained fluids arising in the context of effective field theory. We demonstrate that BullFrog significantly improves upon other LPT-inspired integrators, such as FastPM and COLA, without incurring any computational overhead compared to standard N-body integrators. Implementing BullFrog in any existing N-body code is straightforward, particularly if FastPM is already integrated.</description>

      <title>Explain Like I'm Five: Using LLMs to Improve PDE Surrogate Models with Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is ubiquitous in science and engineering. Computational complexity and difficulty in writing numerical solvers has motivated the development of machine learning techniques to generate solutions quickly. Many existing methods are purely data driven, relying solely on numerical solution fields, rather than known system information such as boundary conditions and governing equations. However, the recent rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled easy integration of text in multimodal machine learning models. In this work, we use pretrained LLMs to integrate various amounts known system information into PDE learning. Our multimodal approach significantly outperforms our baseline model, FactFormer, in both next-step prediction and autoregressive rollout performance on the 2D Heat, Burgers, Navier-Stokes, and Shallow Water equations. Further analysis shows that pretrained LLMs provide highly structured latent space that is consistent with the amount of system information provided through text.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Stochastic Non-Equilibrium Thermal Effects of Particle Inclusions within Fluid Interfaces and Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate theoretical modeling approaches and develop practical computational simulation methods for investigating the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of fluid interfaces with passive and active immersed particles. Our approaches capture phenomena taking into account thermal and dissipative energy exchanges, hydrodynamic coupling, and correlated spontaneous fluctuations. Our methods allow for modeling non-uniform time-varying temperature fields, fluid momentum fields, and their impacts on particle drift-diffusion dynamics. We show how practical stochastic numerical methods can be developed for these systems by performing analysis to factor operators analytically to obtain efficient algorithms for generating the fluctuating fields. We demonstrate our methods in a few simulation studies showing how they can be used to capture particle heating of the interface and the roles of thermal gradients on hydrodynamic fluctuations. The methods developed provide modeling and simulation approaches that can be used for further investigations of non-equilibrium phenomena in active soft materials, complex fluids, and biophysical systems.</description>

Abstract: Geological Carbon Storage GCS is arguably the only scalable net-negative CO2 emission technology available While promising subsurface complexities and heterogeneity of reservoir properties demand a systematic approach to quantify uncertainty when optimizing production and mitigating storage risks which include assurances of Containment and Conformance of injected supercritical CO2 As a first step towards the design and implementation of a Digital Twin for monitoring underground storage operations a machine learning based data-assimilation framework is introduced and validated on carefully designed realistic numerical simulations As our implementation is based on Bayesian inference but does not yet support control and decision-making we coin our approach an uncertainty-aware Digital Shadow To characterize the posterior distribution for the state of CO2 plumes conditioned on multi-modal time-lapse data the envisioned Shadow combines techniques from Simulation-Based Inference SBI and Ensemble Bayesian Filtering to establish probabilistic baselines and assimilate multi-modal data for GCS problems that are challenged by large degrees of freedom nonlinear multi-physics non-Gaussianity and computationally expensive to evaluate fluid flow and seismic simulations To enable SBI for dynamic systems a recursive scheme is proposed where the Digital Shadows neural networks are trained on simulated ensembles for their state and observed data well and/or seismic Once training is completed the systems state is inferred when time-lapse field data becomes available In this computational study we observe that a lack of knowledge on the permeability field can be factored into the Digital Shadows uncertainty quantification To our knowledge this work represents the first proof of concept of an uncertainty-aware in-principle scalable Digital Shadow.</description>

      <title>Effect of span size in Scale Resolving Simulations of airfoil stall and post-stall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In aerodynamic design, the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools has long relied on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady RANS (URANS) turbulence models. However, these methods face limitations in predicting massively separated flow regions. As a result, there is growing emphasis on scale-resolving methods such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which have become more feasible due to advancements in computational resources. This study focuses on the LES of airfoil flows, specifically analyzing the influence of the spanwise extent of the computational domain on aerodynamic forces. We examine the NREL S826 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of $Re_c = 10^5$ under different angles of attack, with simulations performed using the PyFR solver. Our results highlight the importance of adequate spanwise resolution, particularly in post-stall flow conditions, where larger span sizes are necessary to accurately capture three-dimensional flow structures. The findings suggest that for certain flow regimes, traditional two-dimensional statistical representations may not be sufficient, necessitating further investigation into 3D flow phenomena.</description>

      <title>Phonon coherence and minimum thermal conductivity in disordered superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon coherence elucidates the propagation and interaction of phonon quantum states within superlattice, unveiling the wave-like nature and collective behaviors of phonons. Taking MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ lateral heterostructures as a model system, we demonstrate that the intricate interplay between wave-like and particle-like phonons, previously observed in perfect superlattice only, also occurs in disordered superlattice. By employing molecular dynamics simulation based on a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential constructed herein, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity on the interface density in both perfect and disordered superlattice, with a global minimum occurring at relatively higher interface density for disordered superlattice. The counter-intuitive phonon coherence contribution can be characterized by the lagged self-similarity of the structural sequences in the disordered superlattice. Our findings extend the realm of coherent phonon transport from perfect superlattice to more general structures, which offers more flexibility in tuning thermal transport in superlattices.</description>

      <title>Learning Physics From Video: Unsupervised Physical Parameter Estimation for Continuous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting physical dynamical system parameters from videos is of great interest to applications in natural science and technology. The state-of-the-art in automatic parameter estimation from video is addressed by training supervised deep networks on large datasets. Such datasets require labels, which are difficult to acquire. While some unsupervised techniques -- which depend on frame prediction -- exist, they suffer from long training times, instability under different initializations, and are limited to hand-picked motion problems. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the physical parameters of any known, continuous governing equation from single videos; our solution is suitable for different dynamical systems beyond motion and is robust to initialization compared to previous approaches. Moreover, we remove the need for frame prediction by implementing a KL-divergence-based loss function in the latent space, which avoids convergence to trivial solutions and reduces model size and compute.</description>

Abstract: The determination of mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus provides an important means to compare classical molecular dynamics simulations with materials. In this respect, ultra-thin materials hold several challenges: their volume is ambiguous, and different methods to determine a stress-strain relation deliver different result in particular for disordered systems. Using the example of carbon nanomembranes we show that stress-strain simulations following experimental setups deliver correct results if adjusted carefully.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Constant pH Simulation with FMM Electrostatics in GROMACS. (A) Design and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural dynamics of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA/RNA, or complexes thereof, are strongly influenced by protonation changes of their typically many titratable groups, which explains their sensitivity to pH changes. Conversely, conformational and environmental changes of the biomolecule affect the protonation state of these groups. With few exceptions, conventional force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations do not account for these effects, nor do they allow for coupling to a pH buffer.
  Here we present a GROMACS implementation of a rigorous Hamiltonian interpolation $\lambda$-dynamics constant pH method, which rests on GPU-accelerated Fast Multipole Method (FMM) electrostatics. Our implementation supports both CHARMM36m and Amber99sb*-ILDN force fields and is largely automated to enable seamless switching from regular MD to constant pH MD, involving minimal changes to the input files. Here, the first of two companion papers describes the underlying constant pH protocol and sample applications to several prototypical benchmark systems such as cardiotoxin V, lysozyme, and staphylococcal nuclease. Enhanced convergence is achieved through a new dynamic barrier height optimization method, and high p$K_a$ accuracy is demonstrated. We use Functional Mode Analysis and Mutual Information to explore the complex intra- and intermolecular couplings between the protonation states of titratable groups as well as those between protonation states and conformational dynamics. We identify striking conformation-dependent p$K_a$ variations and unexpected inter-residue couplings. Conformation-protonation coupling is identified as a primary cause of the slow protonation convergence notorious to constant pH simulations involving multiple titratable groups, suggesting enhanced sampling methods to accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>Short-time Accuracy and Intra-electron Correlation for Nonadiabatic Quantum-Classical Mapping Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic quantum-classical mapping approaches have significantly gained in popularity in the past several decades because they have acceptable accuracy while remaining numerically tractable even for large system sizes. In the recent few years, several novel mapping approaches have been developed that display higher accuracy than the traditional Ehrenfest method, linearized semiclassical initial value representation (LSC-IVR), and Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME) approaches. While various benchmarks have already demonstrated the advantages and limitations of those methods, rigorous theoretical justifications of their short-time accuracy are still demanded. In this article, we systematically examine the intra-electron correlation, as a statistical measure of electronic phase space, which has been first formally proposed for mapping approaches in the context of the generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation (GDTWA) and which is a key ingredient for the improvement of short-time accuracy of such mapping approaches. We rigorously establish the connection between short-time accuracy and intra-electron correlation for various widely used models. We find that LSC-IVR, PBME, and Ehrenfest methods fail to correctly reproduce the intra-electron correlation. While some of the traceless Meyer--Miller--Stock--Thoss (MMST) approaches, partially linearized density matrix (PLDM) approach, and spin partially linearized density matrix (Spin-PLDM) approach are able to sample the intra-electron correlation correctly, the spin linearized semiclassical (Spin-LSC) approach and the other traceless MMST approaches sample the intra-correlation faithfully only for two-level systems. Our theoretical analysis provides insights into the short-time accuracy of semiclassical methods and presents mathematical justifications for previous numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Accessing Numerical Energy Hessians with Graph Neural Network Potentials and Their Application in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to the potential energy Hessian enables determination of the Gibbs free energy, and certain approaches to transition state search and optimization. Here, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf pretrained Open Catalyst Project (OCP) machine learned potentials (MLPs) determine the Hessian with great success (58 cm$^{-1}$ mean absolute error (MAE)) for intermediates adsorbed to heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. This enables the use of OCP models for the aforementioned applications. The top performing model, with a simple offset correction, gives good estimations of the vibrational entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy with an MAE of 0.042 eV at 300 K. The ability to leverage models to capture the translational entropy was also explored. It was determined that 94% of randomly sampled systems had a translational entropy greater than 0.1 eV at 300 K. This underscores the need to go beyond the harmonic approximation to consider the entropy introduced by adsorbate translation, which increases with temperature. Lastly, we used MLP determined Hessian information for transition state search and found we were able to reduce the number of unconverged systems by 65% to 93% overall convergence, improving on the baseline established by CatTSunami.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Consistent Graph Neural Networks for Distributed Mesh-based Data-driven Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a distributed graph neural network (GNN) methodology for mesh-based modeling applications using a consistent neural message passing layer. As the name implies, the focus is on enabling scalable operations that satisfy physical consistency via halo nodes at sub-graph boundaries. Here, consistency refers to the fact that a GNN trained and evaluated on one rank (one large graph) is arithmetically equivalent to evaluations on multiple ranks (a partitioned graph). This concept is demonstrated by interfacing GNNs with NekRS, a GPU-capable exascale CFD solver developed at Argonne National Laboratory. It is shown how the NekRS mesh partitioning can be linked to the distributed GNN training and inference routines, resulting in a scalable mesh-based data-driven modeling workflow. We study the impact of consistency on the scalability of mesh-based GNNs, demonstrating efficient scaling in consistent GNNs for up to O(1B) graph nodes on the Frontier exascale supercomputer.</description>

      <title>Constant pH Simulation with FMM Electrostatics in GROMACS. (B) GPU Accelerated Hamiltonian Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural dynamics of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, DNA/RNA, or their complexes, are strongly influenced by protonation changes of their typically many titratable groups, which explains their pH sensitivity. In turn, conformational and environmental changes in the biomolecule affect the protonation state of these groups. With a few exceptions, conventional force field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations do not account for these effects, nor do they allow for coupling to a pH buffer.
  The $\lambda$-dynamics method implements this coupling and thus allows for MD simulations at constant pH. It uses separate Hamiltonians for the protonated and deprotonated states of each titratable group, with a $\lambda$ variable that continuously interpolates between them. However, rigorous implementations of Hamiltonian Interpolation (HI) $\lambda$-dynamics are prohibitively slow when used with Particle Mesh Ewald (PME). To circumvent this problem, it has been proposed to interpolate the charges instead of the Hamiltonians (QI).
  Here, we propose a rigorous yet efficient Multipole-Accelerated Hamiltonian Interpolation (MAHI) method to perform $\lambda$-dynamics in GROMACS. Starting from a charge-scaled Hamiltonian, precomputed with the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) or with PME, the correct HI forces are calculated with negligible computational overhead. We compare HI with QI and show that HI leads to more frequent transitions between protonation states, resulting in better sampling and accuracy. Our performance benchmarks show that introducing, e.g., 512 titratable sites to a one million atom MD system increases runtime by less than 20% compared to a regular FMM-based simulation. We have integrated the scheme into our GPU-FMM code for the simulation software GROMACS, allowing an easy and effortless transition from standard force field simulations to constant pH simulations.</description>

      <title>Solving Schr\"{o}dinger Equation Using Tensor Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solve the many-body Schrodinger equation by the tensor neural network. Based on the tensor product structure, we can do the direct numerical integration by using fixed quadrature points for the functions constructed by the tensor neural network within tolerable computational complexity. Especially, we design several types of efficient numerical methods to treat the variable-coupled Coulomb potentials with high accuracy. The corresponding machine learning method is built for solving many-body Schrodinger equation. Some numerical examples are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>cuPSS: a package for pseudo-spectral integration of stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large part of modern research, especially in the broad field of complex systems, relies on the numerical integration of PDEs, with and without stochastic noise. This is usually done with eiher in-house made codes or external packages like MATLAB, Mathematica, Fenicsx, OpenFOAM, Dedalus, and others. These packages rarely offer a good combination of speed, generality, and the option to easily add stochasticity to the system, while in-house codes depend on certain expertise to obtain good performance, and are usually written for each specific use case, sacrificing modularity and reusability. This paper introduces a package written in CUDA C++, thus enabling by default gpu acceleration, that performs pseudo-spectral integration of generic stochastic PDEs in flat lattices in one, two and three dimensions. This manuscript describes the basic functionality of cuPSS, with an example and benchmarking, showing that cuPSS offers a considerable improvement in speed over other popular finite-difference and spectral solvers.</description>
