      <title>Linking Opinion Dynamics and Emotional Expression in Online Communities: A Case Study of COVID-19 Vaccination Discourse in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media discourse on COVID-19 vaccination provides a valuable context for studying opinion formation, emotional expression, and social influence during a global crisis. While prior studies have examined emotional strategies within communities and the link between emotions and vaccine hesitancy, few have investigated dynamic emotion changes across collective, community, and individual levels. In this study, we address this gap by conducting an integrated analysis of the evolving collective emotions, community affiliations, and individual emotion changes associated with opinion shifts. Our results show that collective emotions exhibit distinct trends in response to vaccination progress. Emotional compositions differ across communities and respond dynamically to changing pandemic circumstances, potentially reflecting the communities' influence on users' opinions. At the individual level, users shifting to pro-vaccine opinions display markedly different emotional changes compared to those shifting toward anti-vaccine opinions. Together, these findings highlight the central role of emotions in shaping users' vaccination opinions.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Order Block Structure in Higher-Order Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order networks, naturally described as hypergraphs, are essential for modeling real-world systems involving interactions among three or more entities. Stochastic block models offer a principled framework for characterizing mesoscale organization, yet their extension to hypergraphs involves a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. A recent simplification, a single-order model, mitigates this complexity by assuming a single affinity pattern governs interactions of all orders. This universal assumption, however, may overlook order-dependent structural details. Here, we propose a framework that relaxes this assumption by introducing a multi-order block structure, in which different affinity patterns govern distinct subsets of interaction orders. Our framework is based on a multi-order stochastic block model and searches for the optimal partition of the set of interaction orders that maximizes out-of-sample hyperlink prediction performance. Analyzing a diverse range of real-world networks, we find that multi-order block structures are prevalent. Accounting for them not only yields better predictive performance over the single-order model but also uncovers sharper, more interpretable mesoscale organization. Our findings reveal that order-dependent mechanisms are a key feature of the mesoscale organization of real-world higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>TAGFN: A Text-Attributed Graph Dataset for Fake News Detection in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized machine learning on text-attributed graphs, but the application of LLMs to graph outlier detection, particularly in the context of fake news detection, remains significantly underexplored. One of the key challenges is the scarcity of large-scale, realistic, and well-annotated datasets that can serve as reliable benchmarks for outlier detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce TAGFN, a large-scale, real-world text-attributed graph dataset for outlier detection, specifically fake news detection. TAGFN enables rigorous evaluation of both traditional and LLM-based graph outlier detection methods. Furthermore, it facilitates the development of misinformation detection capabilities in LLMs through fine-tuning. We anticipate that TAGFN will be a valuable resource for the community, fostering progress in robust graph-based outlier detection and trustworthy AI. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kayzliu/TAGFN and our code is available at https://github.com/kayzliu/tagfn.</description>

      <title>A Network Dynamical Systems Approach to SDGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a complex, interdependent framework where progress in one area can synergistically promote or competitively inhibit progress in others. For policymakers in international development, a critical challenge is identifying "leverage points" - specific goals where limited resource allocation yields the maximum system-wide benefit. This study addresses this challenge by modeling the SDGs as a Networked Dynamical System (NDS). Using empirical data from Our World in Data (2018), we construct a weighted interaction network of 16 SDG indicators. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression to derive coupling weights empirically. Unlike previous static analyses, we simulate the temporal evolution of development indicators using an extended Lotka-Volterra model. To ensure numerical stability and sophistication, we upgrade the simulation method from standard Euler integration to the Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method. Our simulation, applied to a case study of Mexico, reveals that SDG 4 (Quality Education) acts as a critical driver, suggesting that prioritizing education yields the most significant positive spillover effects across the development network. Furthermore, we perform sensitivity analysis and explore the power-law relationship between investment and stability.</description>

      <title>On Evolution-Based Models for Experimentation Under Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact network structure; instead, it suffices to characterize how those interactions contribute to the evolution of outcomes. Building on this principle, we study an evolution-based approach that investigates how outcomes change across observation rounds in response to interventions, hence compensating for missing network information. Using an exposure-mapping perspective, we give an axiomatic characterization of when the empirical distribution of outcomes follows a low-dimensional recursive equation, and identify minimal structural conditions under which such evolution mappings exist. We frame this as a distributional counterpart to difference-in-differences. Rather than assuming parallel paths for individual units, it exploits parallel evolution patterns across treatment scenarios to estimate counterfactual trajectories. A key insight is that treatment randomization plays a role beyond eliminating latent confounding; it induces an implicit sampling from hidden interference channels, enabling consistent learning about heterogeneous spillover effects. We highlight causal message passing as an instantiation of this method in dense networks while extending to more general interference structures, including influencer networks where a small set of units drives most spillovers. Finally, we discuss the limits of this approach, showing that strong temporal trends or endogenous interference can undermine identification.</description>

      <title>Illusions of Intimacy: How Emotional Dynamics Shape Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11649v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI companion chatbots, such as those offered by Replika and CharacterAI, increasingly function as always-available companions that provide empathy, validation, and support. While these systems appear to meet basic needs for connection, mounting safety concerns raise a deeper question: how do processes of emotional bonding and intimacy formation unfold in human-AI relationships? Prior research has relied largely on self-reports, interviews, or clinical assessments, leaving unclear how real-world emotional dynamics develop within ongoing human-AI conversations. We address this gap by analyzing over 17,000 user-shared chats with social chatbots from Reddit forums. We show that AI companions dynamically track and mimic user affect and amplify positive emotions, including when users share explicit or transgressive content. These dynamics suggest how chatbots can engage psychological processes involved in intimacy formation and emotional bonding. Finally, we release an anonymized dataset of emotionally salient human-AI companion dialogues to support future empirical work and discuss implications for redesigning and governing social chatbots as high-risk systems for vulnerable users.</description>

      <title>Multiple Randomization Designs: Estimation and Inference with Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we introduce a new class of experimental designs. In a classical randomized controlled trial (RCT), or A/B test, a randomly selected subset of a population of units (e.g., individuals, plots of land, or experiences) is assigned to a treatment (treatment A), and the remainder of the population is assigned to the control treatment (treatment B). The difference in average outcome by treatment group is an estimate of the average effect of the treatment. However, motivating our study, the setting for modern experiments is often different, with the outcomes and treatment assignments indexed by multiple populations. For example, outcomes may be indexed by buyers and sellers, by content creators and subscribers, by drivers and riders, or by travelers and airlines and travel agents, with treatments potentially varying across these indices. Spillovers or interference can arise from interactions between units across populations. For example, sellers' behavior may depend on buyers' treatment assignment, or vice versa. This can invalidate the simple comparison of means as an estimator for the average effect of the treatment in classical RCTs. We propose new experiment designs for settings in which multiple populations interact. We show how these designs allow us to study questions about interference that cannot be answered by classical randomized experiments. Finally, we develop new statistical methods for analyzing these Multiple Randomization Designs.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy for finite data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer entropy is a widely used measure for quantifying directed information flows in complex systems. While the challenges of estimating transfer entropy for continuous data are well known, it has two major shortcomings for data of finite cardinality: it exhibits a substantial positive bias for sparse bin counts, and it has no clear means to assess statistical significance. By computing information content in finite data streams without explicitly considering symbols as instances of random variables, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation.</description>

      <title>Limit Order Book Dynamics in Matching Markets: Microstructure, Spread, and Execution Slippage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional models of matching markets assume that monetary transfers can clear markets by compensating for utility differentials. However, empirical patterns show that such transfers often fail to close structural preference gaps. This paper introduces a market microstructure framework that models matching decisions as a limit order book system with rigid bid ask spreads. Individual preferences are represented by a latent preference state matrix, where the spread between an agent's internal ask price (the unconditional maximum) and the market's best bid (the reachable maximum) creates a structural liquidity constraint. We establish a Threshold Impossibility Theorem showing that linear compensation cannot close these spreads unless it induces a categorical identity shift. A dynamic discrete choice execution model further demonstrates that matches occur only when the market to book ratio crosses a time decaying liquidity threshold, analogous to order execution under inventory pressure. Numerical experiments validate persistent slippage, regional invariance of preference orderings, and high tier zero spread executions. The model provides a unified microstructure explanation for matching failures, compensation inefficiency, and post match regret in illiquid order driven environments.</description>
