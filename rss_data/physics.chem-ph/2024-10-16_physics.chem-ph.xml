      <title>Brush structures directly anchored to ion beam treated polymer surfaces without linker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brush structure is an interesting object for future applications in medical and electronic devices. Usual substrate for the brushes is silicon wafer with linker molecules. In present study an ion beam treatment of polymer was used for attachment of brush structures without liker molecules. The goal of the study was a fabrication of carbonized active substrate and a direct attachment of different brush molecules. The carbonised coating on silicon wafer has been prepared from ion beam implanted polystyrene coating and characterised with AFM, XPS, ESR, Raman, FTIR and ellipsometry measurements. The brush structures based on polystyrene and polyacrylamide backbone with thiol, amine and carboxyl end groups have been synthesised on the carbonised substrates. The brush structures have been characterised with ellipsometry, XPS, FTIR and AFM. The swollen brush shows a thickness phase transition with temperature rise. The attachment of the brush structures is based on free radical reactions on the carbonised surface. The effect of impurity of the brush polymer was found significant. Thus, the brush structures of broad kinds of the end groups can be synthesised on the carbonised substrates without a linker.</description>

      <title>Three-states model for calculating the $X$-$X$ rovibrational transition intensities in hydroxyl radical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The best available line list of OH [Brooke et al. (2016)] contains the high-quality line frequencies, yet the line intensities need refinement because the model function used to interpolate the RKR potential and to extrapolate it into the repulsion region was not analytic [Medvedev et al. Mol. Phys. (2024)], and also because the coupling between the ground $X^2\Pi$ and first excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ electronic states was treated by the perturbation theory. In this paper, we performed ab initio calculations of all necessary molecular functions at $r=0.4$-8.0 bohr, and then we construct fully analytic model functions entering the Hamiltonian. The model functions were fitted to both the \ai\ data and the available experimental data on the line positions and energy levels, the relative line intensities, and the transition dipole moments derived from the measured permanent dipoles. The system of three coupled Schr\"odinger equations for two multiplet components of the $X$ state plus the $A$ state was solved to calculate the energy levels and the line intensities. The new set of the \EinA\ permits to decrease the scatter of the logarithmic populations of the ro-vibrational levels derived from the observed radiation fluxes [Noll et al. (2020)], to achieve better agreement with the measured relative intensities, and to obtain significant differences in the intensities of the $\Lambda$ doublets for large $v$ and $J$ as observed by Noll et al. The $X$-$A$ coupling fully modifies the Q-line intensities at high $J$ by removing the well-known $J^{-2}$ dependence. A new line list is constructed where the transition frequencies are from Brooke \etal\ and the \EinA\ are from the present study. However, not all the problems with the intensities were resolved, presumably due to the neglect of the interaction with the $^4\Sigma^-,^2\Sigma^-$ and $^4\Pi$ repulsive electronic terms.</description>

      <title>A New Angle on Benchmarking Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For noncovalent interactions (NCIs), the CCSD(T) coupled cluster method is widely regarded as the `gold standard'. With localized orbital approximations, benchmarks for ever larger NCI complexes are being published; yet tantalizing evidence from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) results appears to indicate that as the system size grows, CCSD(T) overbinds NCIs by progressively larger amounts, particularly when $\pi$-stacking is involved. Alas, post-CCSD(T) methods like CCSDT(Q) are cost-prohibitive, which requires us to consider alternative means of estimating post-CCSD(T) contributions. In this work, we take a step back by considering the evolution of the correlation energy with respect to the number of subunits for such $\pi$-stacked sequences as acene dimers and alkadiene dimers. We show it to be almost perfectly linear, and propose the slope of the line as a probe for the behavior of a given electron correlation method. By comparison with rank-reduced CCSDT(Q) results for benzene and naphthalene dimers, we show that while CCSD(T) does slightly overbind, it does not at the level suggested by the QMC results.</description>

      <title>Microwaves reveal the nanoscale ion intercalation and edge activity of 2D catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated demand for electrochemical energy storage urges the need for new, sustainable, stable and lightweight materials able to store high energy densities rapidly and efficiently. Development of these functional materials requires specialized techniques that can provide a close insight into the electrochemical properties at the nanoscale. For this reason, we have introduced the electrochemical scanning microwave microscopy (EC-SMM) enabling local measurement of electrochemical properties with nanometer spatial resolution and sensitivity down to atto-Ampere electrochemical currents. The exceptional power of EC-SMM operated at radio frequency is exemplified here by the successful detection of the electrochemical activity and dynamics of molecularly thin NiCo(OH)2 flakes with a spatial resolution of 16 +/- 1 nm, uncovering the location of the active sites and providing atomistic details on the catalytic process that controls the electrocatalytic performance. Our results pinpoint the factors required to tune the thermodynamics of ion intercalation and to optimize the surface adsorption.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Knowledge Integration for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-training machine learning models on molecular properties has proven effective for generating robust and generalizable representations, which is critical for advancements in drug discovery and materials science. While recent work has primarily focused on data-driven approaches, the KANO model introduces a novel paradigm by incorporating knowledge-enhanced pre-training. In this work, we expand upon KANO by integrating the large-scale ChEBI knowledge graph, which includes 2,840 functional groups -- significantly more than the original 82 used in KANO. We explore two approaches, Replace and Integrate, to incorporate this extensive knowledge into the KANO framework. Our results demonstrate that including ChEBI leads to improved performance on 9 out of 14 molecular property prediction datasets. This highlights the importance of utilizing a larger and more diverse set of functional groups to enhance molecular representations for property predictions.

      <title>Noise-robust chemical reaction networks training artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit (ReLU) or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose a CRN that performs both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust CRN for full NN computation, including backpropagation, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.</description>

      <title>Emerging chirality and moir\'e dynamics in twisted layered material heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superstructures arising at twisted 2D interfaces have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community due to exotic quantum states and unique mechanical and tribological behaviors that they exhibit. Here, we predict the emergence of chiral distortions in twisted layered interfaces of finite dimensions. This phenomenon originates in intricate interplay between interfacial interactions and contact boundary constraints. A metric termed the fractional chiral area, is introduced to quantify the overall chirality of the moir\'e superstructure and to characterize its spatial distribution. Despite the equilibrium nature of the discovered energetic and structural chirality effects they are shown to be manifested in the twisting dynamics of layered interfaces, which demonstrates a continuous transition from stick-slip to smooth rotation with no external trigger.</description>

      <title>FragNet: A Graph Neural Network for Molecular Property Prediction with Four Layers of Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial step in many modern-day scientific applications including drug discovery and energy storage material design. Despite the availability of numerous machine learning models for this task, we are lacking in models that provide both high accuracies and interpretability of the predictions. We introduce the FragNet architecture, a graph neural network not only capable of achieving prediction accuracies comparable to the current state-of-the-art models, but also able to provide insight on four levels of molecular substructures. This model enables understanding of which atoms, bonds, molecular fragments, and molecular fragment connections are critical in the prediction of a given molecular property. The ability to interpret the importance of connections between fragments is of particular interest for molecules which have substructures that are not connected with regular covalent bonds. The interpretable capabilities of FragNet are key to gaining scientific insights from the model's learned patterns between molecular structure and molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Structure of the water/magnetite interface from sum frequency generation experiments and neural network based molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetite, a naturally abundant mineral, frequently interacts with water in both natural settings and various technical applications, making the study of its surface chemistry highly relevant. In this work, we investigate the hydrogen bonding dynamics and the presence of hydroxyl species at the magnetite-water interface using a combination of neural network potential-based molecular dynamics simulations and sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. Our simulations, which involved large water systems, allowed us to identify distinct interfacial species, such as dissociated hydrogen and hydroxide ions formed by water dissociation. Notably, water molecules near the interface exhibited a preference for dipole orientation towards the surface, with bulk-like water behavior only re-emerging beyond 60 {\AA} from the surface. The vibrational spectroscopy results aligned well with the simulations, confirming the presence of a hydrogen bond network in the surface ad-layers. The analysis revealed that surface-adsorbed hydroxyl groups orient their hydrogen atoms towards the water bulk. In contrast, hydrogen-bonded water molecules align with their hydrogen atoms pointing towards the magnetite surface.</description>

      <title>React-OT: Optimal Transport for Generating Transition State in Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition states (TSs) are transient structures that are key in understanding reaction mechanisms and designing catalysts but challenging to be captured in experiments. Alternatively, many optimization algorithms have been developed to search for TSs computationally. Yet the cost of these algorithms driven by quantum chemistry methods (usually density functional theory) is still high, posing challenges for their applications in building large reaction networks for reaction exploration. Here we developed React-OT, an optimal transport approach for generating unique TS structures from reactants and products. React-OT generates highly accurate TS structures with a median structural root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.053{\AA} and median barrier height error of 1.06 kcal/mol requiring only 0.4 second per reaction. The RMSD and barrier height error is further improved by roughly 25\% through pretraining React-OT on a large reaction dataset obtained with a lower level of theory, GFN2-xTB. We envision that the remarkable accuracy and rapid inference of React-OT will be highly useful when integrated with the current high-throughput TS search workflow. This integration will facilitate the exploration of chemical reactions with unknown mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Collisional Cooling of Ultracold Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the original work on Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum degenerate gases of atoms have allowed the quantum emulation of important systems from condensed matter and nuclear physics, as well as the study of novel many-body states with no analog in other fields of physics. Ultracold molecules in the micro- and nano-Kelvin regimes promise to bring powerful new capabilities to quantum emulation and quantum computing, thanks to their rich internal degrees of freedom compared to atoms. They also open new possibilities for precision measurement and the study of quantum chemistry. Quantum gases of atoms were made possible by collision-based cooling schemes, such as evaporative cooling. For ultracold molecules, thermalization and collisional cooling have not been realized. With other techniques such as supersonic jets and cryogenic buffer gases, studies have been limited to temperatures above 10 mK. Here we show cooling of NaLi molecules at micro- and nano-Kelvin temperatures through collisions with ultracold Na atoms, both prepared in their stretched hyperfine spin states. We find a lower bound on the elastic to inelastic collision ratio between molecules and atoms greater than 50 -- large enough to support sustained collisional cooling. By employing two stages of evaporation, we increase the phase-space density (PSD) of the molecules by a factor of 20, achieving temperatures as low as 220 nK. The favorable collisional properties of a Na and NaLi mixture show great promise for making deeply quantum degenerate dipolar molecules and suggest the potential for such cooling in other systems.</description>
