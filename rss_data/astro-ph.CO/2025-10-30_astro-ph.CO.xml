      <title>The Binary Ballet: Mapping Local Expansion Around M81 &amp; M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \left(63 \pm 6 \right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\pm 0.49) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \pm 0.36)\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \pm 0.69)\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.</description>

      <title>The cosmological analysis of DES 3$\times$2pt data from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. While our results are consistent within $\lesssim 2\sigma$ with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, they exhibit stronger tension with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior, highlighting the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from the merger of oscillons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the merger of oscillons results in a broad spectrum of the oscillon mass. A huge number of oscillon samples obtained from numerical lattice simulations reveal that the oscillon mass distribution has an exponential tail in a heavy-mass region. This enables us to infer the fractional abundance of heavy oscillons. Using the criterion for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the oscillon collapse obtained in previous studies, we estimate the abundance of PBHs and conclude that a sizable number of PBHs can be produced from oscillons. It can be an alternative PBH formation mechanism without employing the tuning of the inflaton potential to enhance the small-scale density fluctuations in the conventional PBH formation scenario.</description>

      <title>A Unified Photometric Redshift Calibration for Weak Lensing Surveys using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxies is a critical component in the study of weak gravitational lensing. Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\sigma_{\bar z} \sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Cosmic Birefringence from SPIDER, Planck, and ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model has been proposed as a candidate mechanism to generate cosmic birefringence through a Chern-Simons coupling between a dynamical scalar field and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon. Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\alpha+\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\sigma$. We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either $gM_{Pl}$ or $\alpha+\beta$, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT's high-$\ell$ results and leads to a better PTE for those measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraining baryonic feedback and cosmology from DES Y3 and Planck PR4 6$\times$2pt data. I. $\Lambda$CDM models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2pt) to constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 Maglim catalog and the Planck satellite PR4 data release. We include all data points in the DES Y3 cosmic shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) down to 2.$^\prime$5 and model baryonic feedback processes via principal components (PCs) that are constructed from the ANTILLES simulations. We find a tight correlation between the amplitude of the first PC $Q_1$ and mean normalized baryon mass fraction $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}=\bar{f}_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/\Omega_\mathrm{m})$ from the ANTILLES simulations and employ an independent $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ measurement from Akino et al. (2022) as a prior of $Q_1$. We train a neural network $6\times2$pt emulator to boost the analysis speed by $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, which enables us to run an impressive number of simulated analyses to validate our analysis against various systematics. For our 6$\times$2pt analysis, we find $S_8=0.8073\pm0.0094$ when including a $Q_1$ prior from $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ observations. This level of cosmological constraining power allows us to put tight constraints on the strength of baryonic feedback. We find $Q_1=0.025^{+0.024}_{-0.029}$ for our 6$\times$2pt analysis and $Q_1=0.043\pm{0.016}$ when combining with external information from Planck, ACT, DESI. All these results indicate weak feedback, e.g., the tensions to Illustris ($Q_1=0.095$) and OWLS AGN T8.7 ($Q_1=0.137$) are 2.9$\sigma$-3.3$\sigma$ and 4.7$\sigma$-5.9$\sigma$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Morphological Zoo of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>A Light-Cone Approach to Higher-Order Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a second-order cosmological perturbation theory on a background geometry expressed in terms of light-cone coordinates, extending the first-order analyses available in the literature. In particular, we investigate the gauge transformations of second-order perturbative quantities on the light-cone and establish their connection with standard perturbation theory. Through a consistent matching procedure, we identify the second-order gauge fixing that corresponds to the non-linear Geodesic Light-Cone gauge within standard perturbation theory, known as the Observational Synchronous Gauge. We then emphasize its conceptual similarities and differences wrt the standard Synchronous Gauge. Finally, within this new perturbative framework, and adopting a fully gauge-invariant approach, we compute the luminosity distance-redshift relation up to second order with anisotropic stress as seen by a free-falling observer. Remarkably, we show how divergences at the observer position can be eliminated in a completely model independent way. These results validate our perturbative framework and establish it as a novel formalism for evaluating cosmological observables at second order.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints from Dark Energy Survey Year 1 Cluster Lensing and Abundances with Simulation-based Forward-Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based forward-modeling framework for cosmological inference from optical galaxy-cluster samples, and apply it to the abundance and weak-lensing signals of DES-Y1 redMaPPer clusters. The model embeds cosmology-dependent optical selection using a counts-in-cylinders approach, while also accounting for cluster miscentering and baryonic feedback in lensing. Applied to DES-Y1, and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we obtain $\Omega_m=0.254^{+0.026}_{-0.020}$ and $\sigma_8=0.826^{+0.030}_{-0.034}$, consistent with a broad suite of low-redshift structure measurements, including recent full-shape analyses, the DES/KiDS/HSC 3$\times$2 results, and most cluster-abundance studies. Our results are also consistent with \textit{Planck}, with the difference being significant at $2.58\sigma$. These results establish simulation-based forward-modeling of cluster abundances as a promising new tool for precision cosmology with Stage~IV survey data.</description>

      <title>Torque cancellation effect of Intensity noise for Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of sub-Hz gravitational waves is of significant importance for astrophysics. It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz and thus enable the detection of $\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100~Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5~m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Bias from small-scale leakage in Pulsar Timing Array maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array experiments are rapidly approaching the era of gravitational wave background anisotropy detection. The timing residuals of each pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across all angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars, current analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the background at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the integrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a previously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map reconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale leakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at scales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into large-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred angular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of scales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry of the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of different regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the quality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of small-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and characterization of the gravitational wave background. Thus, the theoretical formalism developed here will be essential to estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty in anisotropy searches.</description>

      <title>Matter Sourced Bubble Nucleation in the Asymmetron Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density distributions affect thin-wall bubble formation in the asymmetron mechanism, a scalar-tensor theory with a universal coupling to matter and explicit symmetry-breaking, and analyse the stability of its metastable state. We show that the screening mechanism of the asymmetron inside dense objects induces a surface tension associated with the boundary of the screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solutions than the standard Coleman-Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions are used to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the computation of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on flat planes, as well as on concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find that the smallest Euclidean action occurs for bubbles nucleating along the edge of a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge nucleation channel with the bulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which concave edge nucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially suppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of the instanton approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred. This is largely due to the weak couplings of the asymmetron. We apply these findings to determine the maximum curvature radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our results affect the seeding of $N$-body simulations of asymmetron domains, showing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the edges of cosmological voids. We also demonstrate that the presence of a homogeneous gas around the dense substrates reduces the maximum curvature radius, enabling bulk bubbles to form preferentially as the asymmetron undergoes a density-driven phase transition.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating Astrometric and Timing Residuals to Constrain Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cross-correlation between astrometric and timing-residual observables for distant sources, such as pulsars and galaxies, and equivalent observables for nearby solar system bodies. Using the unified spin-weighted formalism introduced in [1], we derive the angular correlation functions-generalised Hellings-Downs curves-that describe the response of these mixed observables to a stochastic, unpolarised gravitational-wave background (SGWB). We compute the expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity for such measurements, focusing on cross-correlations between pulsar timing array (PTA) redshift signals and astrometric or distortion (shimmering) effects induced in solar system objects such as asteroids. Although the current astrometric precision of asteroid tracking does not yet provide competitive constraints relative to PTA-only surveys, the method offers a complementary probe with enhanced sensitivity at higher frequencies. Future wide-field surveys capable of sub-milliarcsecond precision could make this approach a viable tool for detecting or constraining the SGWB. A key advantage of the technique is its reduced susceptibility to correlated systematics across different measurement domains, providing an independent cross-check of PTA detections and a potential observational bridge between PTA and LISA frequency bands.</description>

      <title>A cross-bispectrum estimator for CMB-HI intensity mapping correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity mapping of 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen promises to be a powerful probe of large-scale structure in the post-reionisation epoch. However, HI intensity mapping (IM) experiments will suffer the loss of long-wavelength line-of-sight HI modes in the foreground subtraction process. This significantly reduces HI IM cross-correlations with projected large-scale structure tracers, such as CMB secondary anisotropies. Here we propose a cross-bispectrum estimator, $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21} \delta T_{21}},$ to recover the cross-correlation of the HI IM field, $\delta T_{21},$ with the CMB lensing field, $\kappa,$ constructed by correlating the position-dependent HI power spectrum with the mean overdensity traced by CMB lensing. We study the cross-bispectrum estimator in the squeezed limit and forecast its detectability based on HI IM measurements from HIRAX and CMB lensing measurements from Advanced ACT. We find that $B^{\bar \kappa \delta T_{21}\delta T_{21}},$ in combination with the HI IM and CMB lensing auto-spectra, can place sub-percent constraints on the growth rate of fluctuations, $f,$ and the small scale amplitude of fluctuations, $ \sigma_8.$ The cross-bispectrum, in combination with the auto-spectra and Planck priors, improves dark energy constraints to 0.025 on $w_0$ and 0.11 on $w_a$ for flat models. These results are robust to HI foreground removal because they derive from small-scale HI modes. The HI-CMB lensing cross-bispectrum thus provides a novel way to recover HI correlations with CMB lensing and constrain cosmological parameters at a level that is competitive with next-generation galaxy redshift surveys. As a striking example of this, we find a tight constraint of 27.8 meV (29.0 meV) on the sum of neutrino masses, while varying all redshift and standard cosmological parameters within a flat $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) model.</description>

      <title>TDCOSMO: XX. WFI2033--4723, the First Quadruply-Imaged Quasar Modeled with JWST Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational time delays offer unique, independent measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$. Precise measurements of $H_0$ stand as one of the most pressing challenges in modern cosmology, and to do so with time delays requires precise lens models. While much work has focused on streamlining the modeling process to keep pace with the erumpent discovery of strongly-lensed systems, a critical step toward reducing uncertainty in $H_0$ comes from increasing the precision of individual lens models themselves. In this work, we demonstrate that the unprecedented imaging capabilities of JWST make this goal attainable. We present the first lens model for time-delay cosmography derived from JWST data, applied to the quadruply-imaged quasar WFI2033--4723. While the primary source of systematic uncertainty in time-delay cosmography is currently the mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD), the sensitivity of models to this MSD varies on how the point spread function (PSF) errors are mitigated. As the PSF is also the primary source of uncertainty in lens modeling, we focus on a comparison of different PSF modeling methods. Within the context of power-law models, we recover results in agreement with previous Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-based models, but with better precision of key lensing parameters through implementation of new PSF modeling techniques. Despite the record-holding precision of this system's HST modeling, we achieve an additional 22% increase in precision of the Fermat potential difference, directly reducing uncertainties of cosmological inference. These results would produce a 3% ($1\sigma$ of the modeling error) shift of $H_0$ towards a higher value for this lens, keeping all else constant. This work substantiates the groundbreaking potential of JWST for time-delay cosmography and lays the groundwork for modeling systems previously too faint to provide meaningful constraints on $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Robustness of the CPL Parametrization to Basis and Prior Variations: Insights from DESI DR2 BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reexamine cosmological parameter constraints from the DESI Data Release 2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements using the distance-basis representation (D_V/r_d, D_M/D_H), which separates the isotropic BAO scale from the scale-free Alcock-Paczynski ratio. We compare LambdaCDM, wCDM, and w_0w_aCDM models to evaluate how the choice of data basis and the width of the prior on w_a affect dark-energy inference. Ratio-only fits (D_M/D_H) amplify the (w_0, w_a) degeneracy and can produce large apparent shifts in point estimates without genuine evidence for dynamical dark energy. Joint fits using (D_V/r_d, D_M/D_H) restore parameter consistency and show that these shifts mainly trace the degeneracy ridge. The pivoted equation of state, w_p = w(a_p) \simeq -0.9 \pm 0.1 at z_p \simeq 0.34, remains stable and consistent with a cosmological constant within 1sigma. Model-selection diagnostics (AIC, BIC, and Bayes factors) provide only moderate support for LambdaCDM, indicating no significant evidence for an evolving w(a). These findings clarify the interplay among basis choice, absolute-scale anchoring, and degeneracy geometry in BAO-only dark-energy analyses, providing a benchmark for future DESI and next-generation surveys.</description>

      <title>Solar System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar-System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), making explicit the bridge from cosmology-level linear responses to local, screened residuals. In scalar-tensor frameworks with a universal conformal coupling $A(\phi)$ and chameleon/Vainshtein screening, we map cosmological responses $\{\mu(z,k),\Sigma(z,k)\}$ inferred by DESI and \emph{Euclid} to thin-shell or Vainshtein residuals in deep Solar potentials $\Phi_N$. We emphasize a two-branch strategy. In a detection-first branch, a verified local anomaly -- an Einstein equivalence principle (EEP) violation, a Shapiro-delay signal with $|\gamma-1|\sim\mathrm{few}\times 10^{-6}$, an AU-scale Yukawa tail, or a ultralight DM (ULDM) line in clocks/atom interferometers in space (AIS) -- triggers a joint refit of cosmology and Solar-System data under a common microphysical parameterization $\{V(\phi),A(\phi)\}$. In a guardrail branch, Solar-System tests enforce constraints (EEP; PPN parameters $\gamma,\beta$; and $\dot G/G$) and close unscreened or weakly screened corners indicated by cosmology. We forecast, per conjunction, $|\gamma-1|\lesssim (2-5)\times 10^{-6}$ (Ka-/X-band or optical Shapiro), $\eta_{EEP}\sim (1\mbox{--}10)\times 10^{-17}$ (drag-free AIS), $|\dot G/G|\sim(3-5)\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (sub-mm-class LLR), a uniform ~2x tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $(3-10)\times$ improved ULDM-coupling reach from clocks. For a conformal benchmark, $\mu_{ lin,0}=0.10$ implies $\chi\simeq \sqrt{\mu_{lin,0}/2}$ and a Sun thin shell $\Delta R/R\lesssim (1/3\chi)\sqrt{|\gamma-1|/2}=2.4\times 10^{-3}$ at $|\gamma-1|=5\times 10^{-6}$; Vainshtein screening at 1 AU yields $|\gamma-1|\lesssim 10^{-11}$, naturally below near-term reach. We recommend a cost-effective guardrail+discovery portfolio with explicit triggers for escalation to dedicated missions.</description>

      <title>Calibration-independent consistency test of DESI DR2 BAO and SNIa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5. Our consistency test is {calibration}-independent since it is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters such as the absolute peak magnitude $M_B$ and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$. Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave physics can probe theories that extend beyond General Relativity. Motivated by the attention on the Kalb-Ramond field as a dark matter candidate, in this work, we study a parity violating dimension four operator which couples the dual Riemann curvature to the 2-form field. After mapping the equations of motion for the right- and left-handed gravitational wave amplitudes to the novel parameterization presented in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk}, we discuss constraints on the model parameters in light of the coincident electromagnetic/gravitational wave signal of GW170817.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Population, Cosmology, and Neutron Star Equation of State from Gravitational Waves of Dark Binary Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) are expected to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) emissions, which help identify the host galaxy. Since GWs directly measure their luminosity distances, joint GW-EM observations from BNSs help with the study of cosmology, particularly the Hubble constant, unaffected by cosmic distance ladder systematics. However, detecting the EM emissions is not always possible. Additionally, the tidal deformability of neutron stars (NSs), combined with the knowledge of the NS EoS, can break the degeneracy between mass parameters and redshift, allowing for the inference of the Hubble constant. While several studies have aimed to infer the Hubble constant using dark BNSs (without EM counterparts), none have consistently combined the uncertainties of population, cosmology, and NS EoS within a Bayesian framework. In this study, we propose a novel Bayesian analysis to jointly constrain the NS EoS, population, and cosmological parameters using a population of dark BNSs detected through GW observations. We demonstrate the statistical robustness of our method using $50$ simulated BNS events following Gaussian and double Gaussian mass distributions, detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors operating at O5 sensitivity. We show that such measurements can constrain the Hubble constant with a precision of $\lesssim 35\%$ ($90\%$ credible interval). This level of precision is unattainable without incorporating NS EoS, especially when observing BNS mergers without EM counterpart information. We also report the Hubble constant measurements obtained from a more realistic set of $5$ simulated BNS events.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Inference with Galaxy Luminosity Functions and Colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the first direct cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference from the combination of galaxy luminosity functions and colours using a simulation based inference approach. Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet-near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, Simba &amp; Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $\textit{ugriz}$ and GALEX FUV &amp; NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling &gt;200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions to constrain $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and four parameters controlling the strength of stellar and AGN feedback. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. We achieve constraints on the stellar feedback parameters, as well as $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. The latter is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation-metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $\sigma_8$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling.

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this Letter, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

Abstract: One of the simplest standard model extensions leading to a domain wall network is a real scalar $S$ with a $Z_2$ symmetry spontaneously broken during universe evolution. Motivated by the swampland program, we explore the possibility that quantum gravity effects are responsible for violation of the discrete symmetry, triggering the annihilation of the domain wall network. We explore the resulting cosmological implications in terms of dark radiation, dark matter, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, and wormholes connected to baby universes.</description>

Abstract: Drone-based beam measurements are a promising avenue to tackle the critical challenge of calibration for 21 cm cosmology telescopes. In this paper, we introduce a new drone-based calibration system for 400-800 MHz radio observatories, describing its instrumentation and first deployment. We discuss measurements of the TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder, and present results, including full 2D high spatial resolution beam maps in both co- and cross-polarization, as well as comparisons to simulations. The polarized beam maps cover a 70 degree by 70 degree grid, capturing the first two sidelobes and measuring the TONE main beam and first sidelobe with 7-9% statistical errors. We investigate polarization angle alignment with frequency, finding significant polarization leakage in the TONE antennas at frequencies above 600 MHz, and a polarization axis rotation with frequency. We describe statistical and systematic errors, as well as measurements of radio frequency interference from the drone and equipment. Our drone system is the first to incorporate a broad-band switched calibration source in the drone payload, enabling background subtraction and direct measurements of the RFI emitted by the drone. The results presented are the first drone-based 2D measurements of cross-polar beam structure and of polarization alignment of an array. The high frequency and spatial resolution achieved with this system have revealed the rich structure of the beam of each antenna, and enabled comparisons between individual dishes and to electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Lepton parity dark matter and naturally unstable domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple and predictive setup that connects neutrino masses, dark matter (DM), and gravitational waves. A minimal lepton parity DM scenario is considered where the residual symmetry $(-1)^L$ from the type I seesaw acts as the dark parity $D=(-1)^{L+2j}$, ensuring DM stability without imposing any new symmetry. A singlet Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity serves as the DM candidate, interacting via a real scalar $\sigma$ which is also even lepton parity. The scalar potential possesses an accidental $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, whose spontaneous breaking gives rise to unstable domain walls (DW) in the presence of explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking terms allowed by the lepton parity. The subsequent DW annihilation generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background potentially observable at different GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Viability Constraints on Baryogenesis in f (R, Lm, T) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study explores gravitational baryogenesis in the context of f(R, Lm, T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar, Lm represents the Lagrangian density of the matter field, and T stands for the metric contraction of T_{mu nu}. We focus on a linear model: f(R, Lm, T) = alpha R + beta Lm + gamma T, and examine the parameter constraints for a successful baryon asymmetry generation in four different eras of the cosmos under the assumption of a power-law cosmic expansion. The computed baryon-to-entropy ratio is found to be consistent with the observed order of asymmetry ratio, 9.42 x 10^-11. Furthermore, the study is extended to the generalized framework of gravitational baryogenesis, where the outcome shows strong agreement with the current observational data. Our findings indicate that the f(R, Lm, T) framework provides a compatible theoretical foundation for producing the observed matter imbalance of the cosmos, thereby emphasizing its potential significance in early-universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmology, Decoherence and the Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum decoherence and entropy increase in early universe cosmology. We first study decoherence in a discrete bipartite quantum system for which a single qubit gets entangled with an environment and the entropy increase is correlated with the decay of the off-diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix. We compare this system with continuous systems relevant for cosmology for which there is a natural external intervention, corresponding to the time-dependent separation between the sub- and super-horizon inflationary fluctuations. We find, in this case, that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix, in a field basis, do not decay as sometimes assumed in cosmological set-ups. Nevertheless, following a recent treatment in terms of open Effective Field Theories (EFTs), we compute the entanglement entropy for a Gaussian state and show that it actually increases monotonically ($\dot S&gt;0$) during the accelerated phases ($\ddot a&gt;0$ with $a(t)$ the scale factor). We generalise this result to include non-Gaussian states and briefly discuss the relevance of computing the von Neumann entropy as compared to the thermodynamic entropy.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity forecasts for gravitational-wave detectors to dark matter decaying into gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. In this work, we present model-independent predictions for the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from the decay of ultralight dark matter into gravitons. Within this framework, we forecast the sensitivity reach of current and forthcoming gravitational-wave detectors to such signals.</description>
