      <title>The role of the overlap function in describing angular distributions of single-nucleon transfer reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-nucleon transfer reactions offer a valuable way to probe nuclear structure. We explore the effect of directly introducing overlap functions computed using the Gamow shell model (GSM) into reaction calculations, taking the $\left&lt; ^7\mathrm{Li} \mid \protect{^6\mathrm{He}} + p \right&gt;$ single proton overlap as a case study. By incorporating both inter-nucleon correlations and continuum coupling, the GSM provides accurate overlap functions in both interior and asymptotic regions, together with the corresponding spectroscopic factors (SFs). These theoretical SFs and overlap functions were included in a coupled channels Born approximation analysis of the \(^{6}{\rm He}(d,n)^7{\rm Li}\) transfer reaction. Overlap functions derived from \textit{ab initio} no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations as well as standard single-particle (s.p.) wave functions were also considered for comparison. Our results reveal significant differences between the calculated angular distributions when employing theoretical SFs with standard s.p.\ wave functions compared to the full theoretical overlap functions. Discrepancies were also observed between angular distributions calculated with GSM and NCSM overlap functions, highlighting the importance of internal structure and correct asymptotic behavior in reliable reaction calculations. The GSM overlap functions also provided a good description of the $^{208}$Pb($^7$Li,$^6$He)$^{209}$Bi reaction when included in a coupled reaction channels calculation.</description>

      <title>Perturbative $\chi$EFT calculations of the deuteron and triton up to N$^2$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous studies of the deuteron and triton ground-state energies to next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) in chiral effective field theory, employing a power counting in which subleading interactions are treated perturbatively. Triton calculations are performed using the no-core shell model, and we demonstrate converged perturbative results for regulator cutoffs up to $\Lambda \approx 1200$ MeV. We analyze exceptional cutoffs in the $^3P_0$ and $^3S_1 \mathrm{-}^3D_1$ nucleon-nucleon channels and find a resulting cutoff dependence in the triton ground-state energy at N$^2$LO. The effect associated with the exceptional cutoff in the $^3P_0$ channel can be mitigated by redefining the leading-order wave function within the freedom allowed by the effective field theory. The same approach applied in the $^3S_1 \mathrm{-}^3D_1$ channel remedies the effect of this exceptional cutoff on the ground state energy of the deuteron, but not for the triton.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the initial neutron density distribution from the two-pion HBT correlation function in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the neutron density distribution in the nucleus is one of the crucial tasks of nuclear physics. Within the framework of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamic model followed by a correlation afterburner program, we investigate the effects of the initial neutron density distribution on the charged-pion yield ratio $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$, the two-pion momentum correlation function, and the emission source dimension. It is found that the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio is sensitive to the initial neutron density distribution and the impact parameter, especially for collisions at large impact parameter. However, the charge splitting in the correlation functions between positively $\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ and negatively $\pi^{-}\pi^{-}$, as well as the source radii and volumes extracted exhibit a stronger dependence on the initial neutron density distribution, but a weaker dependence on the impact parameter. The present study highlights that $\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{-}\pi^{-}$ correlation functions in heavy-ion collisions could be used to probe the initial neutron density distribution of nuclei.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of stochastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study heat conduction and momentum transport in the context of stochastic fluid dynamics. We consider a fluid described by model H in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin. We study both non-critical and critical fluids, and we investigate transport properties in two as well as three dimensions. Our results are based on numerical simulations of model H using a Metropolis algorithm, and we employ Kubo relations to extract transport coefficients. We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\kappa\sim L^{x_\kappa}$ with $x_\kappa=1.6\pm 0.1$. The divergence is weaker in three dimensions, $x_\kappa=1.25 \pm 0.3$, and the scaling exponent for the shear viscosity, $x_\eta$, is significantly smaller than $x_\kappa$ in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Method to search for the triple-neutron state in an electron scattering experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electron scattering experiment to search for the trineutron state $^3n$ by reaction ${\rm ^4He}(e,~e'p\pi^{+})^{3}n$ is designed for the A1 facility at Mainzer Microtron. The detailed principles, setup, and simulation of this experiment are presented. With the momenta of the scattered electron, the produced proton and $\pi^+$ from the reaction measured by three spectrometers with their triple coincidence, the missing mass spectrum of $^3n$ can be obtained. The production rate of $^3n$ based on the cross section of the reaction and a MC simulation is estimated to be about 1.5 per day, which can provide a confidence level of the signal greater than 5$\sigma$ with a beam time longer than 16 days. According to a MC simulation that evaluates the energy losses of particles in materials and the performance of three spectrometers, the estimated resolution and the predicted shape of the missing mass spectrum are presented. This work provides a new experimental concept for the search for multineutron states in future experiments with an electron beam.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB method for radial Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit exact WKB quantization for radial Schr\"odinger problems from the modern resurgence perspective, with emphasis on how ``physically meaningful'' quantization paths should be chosen and interpreted. Using connection formulae at simple turning points and at regular singular points, we show that the nontrivial-cycle data give the spectrum. In particular, for the $3$-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the $3$-dimensional Coulomb potential, we explicitly compute a closed contour which starts at $+\infty$, bulges into the $r&lt;0$ sector to encircle the origin, and returns to $+\infty$. Also we propose that the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at $r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\infty$ open path. Our analysis clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices in resurgence-based quantization.</description>

      <title>The mass of $^{101}$Sn and Bayesian extrapolations to the proton drip line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The favorable energy configurations of nuclei at magic numbers of ${N}$ neutrons and ${Z}$ protons are fundamental for understanding the evolution of nuclear structure. The ${Z=50}$ (tin) isotopic chain is a frontier for such studies, with particular interest in nuclear binding at and around the doubly-magic \textsuperscript{100}Sn isotope. Precise mass measurements of neutron-deficient isotopes provide necessary anchor points for mass models to test extrapolations near the proton drip line, where experimental studies currently remain out of reach. In this work, we report the first Penning trap mass measurement of \textsuperscript{101}Sn. The determined mass excess of $-59\,889.89(96)$~keV for \textsuperscript{101}Sn represents a factor of 300 improvement over the current precision and indicates that \textsuperscript{101}Sn is less bound than previously thought. Mass predictions from a recently developed Bayesian model combination (BMC) framework employing statistical machine learning and nuclear masses computed within seven global models based on nuclear Density Functional Theory (DFT) agree within 1$\sigma$ with experimental masses from the $48 \le Z \le 52$ isotopic chains. This provides confidence in the extrapolation of tin masses down to $N=46$.</description>

      <title>Universality of the chiral soliton lattice in the low energy limit of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the chiral soliton lattice (ChSL) is, in a precise sense, a universal feature of the low-energy limit of QCD minimally coupled to Maxwell theory. Here, we disclose that not only can the ChSL be obtained from the gauged Skyrme model in $3+1$ dimensions, including the back-reaction of the Maxwell $U(1)$ gauge field, we also show that the ChSL remains unchanged if the sub-leading corrections to the Skyrme model in the 't Hooft large $N_c$ expansion are included. Taking into account the highly non-linear character of such corrections, this is quite a surprising result. By considering a suitable ansatz adapted to describe topological solitons at finite baryon density in a constant magnetic field, the generalized Skyrme model coupled to the Maxwell theory is reduced to the effective Lagrangian of the ChSL phase, describing a lattice of domain walls made of hadrons. One of the key points in this construction is the fact that even when the usual topological charge density vanishes, the presence of the Callan-Witten term in the topological charge density allows for a non-vanishing baryon number. In the present approach, the magnetic field can be external, as is usually assumed for the ChSL, or it can be self-consistently generated by the hadronic layers themselves. Finally, we show how our formulation allows us to study the coupling of the chiral soliton lattice with quark matter.</description>

      <title>First simultaneous global QCD analysis of kaon and pion parton distributions with lattice QCD constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of pion and kaon parton distribution functions (PDFs), constrained by pion- and kaon-induced Drell-Yan (DY) and leading neutron electroproduction data, together with lattice QCD data on pion and kaon PDF moments. The analysis indicates a softer valence $\bar u$ distribution in the $K^-$ than in the $\pi^-$, and a significantly more peaked valence $s$-quark density in $K^-$ compared with the $\bar u$. The effective exponent governing the high-$x$ behavior of the PDF is found to be larger for $\bar u$ in the kaon, $\beta_{\bar u}^{K^-}\!= 1.6(2)$, than in the pion, $\beta_{\bar u}^{\pi^-}\!= 1.16(4)$, in the range $0.7 \leq x \leq 0.95$. From the gluon momentum fractions we find the pion's gluon content accounts for $\approx 1/3$ of the mass budget of the pion at $\mu=2~{\rm GeV}$, but only $\approx 1/4$ for the kaon.</description>

      <title>The probe limit in MHD and its implications for magnetic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many phenomenological and effective field-theoretical (EFT) applications of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the presence of a background magnetic field employ a simplifying assumption whereby the electromagnetic and the energy-momentum fluctuations decouple. In studies of magnetic transport, for example in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then neglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of this so-called $\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT) model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Initial-state geometry and multiplicity distributions in pPb collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the possibility of accessing the initial geometric shape of the proton in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC, in particular the configuration in which the proton is made of three quarks linked by a Y-shape gluon string, called baryon junction. This initial state spatial configuration has been used in the past to describe data on baryon rapidity distributions, diffractive $J/\psi$ production and multiplicity distributions in pp collisions. In spite of its success in explaining the data, the evidence of the baryon junction still needs confirmation. Further studies will be undertaken at the electron-ion collider. In this work we study multiplicity distributions measured in pPb collisions. Different initial state geometries are used as input in a Monte Carlo event generator which implements the $k_T$-factorization formalism of the CGC with KLN unintegrated gluon distributions. The results indicate that the hard-sphere and Gaussian proton configurations are incompatible with the data. In contrast, the baryon junction configuration can describe the data provided that intrinsic fluctuations of the saturation scale are included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) approaches parametrize the interactions and dynamics of two and more hadrons and their response to different electroweak probes. The inclusion of unitarity, three-body channels, and other properties from scattering theory allows for a reliable extraction of resonance spectra and their properties from data. We review the formalism and application of the ANL-Osaka, the Juelich-Bonn-Washington, and other DCC approaches in the context of light baryon resonances from meson, (virtual) photon, and neutrino-induced reactions, as well as production reactions, strange baryons, light mesons, heavy meson systems, exotics, and baryon-baryon interactions. Finally, we also provide a connection of the formalism to study finite-volume spectra obtained in Lattice QCD, and review applications involving modern statistical and machine learning tools.</description>
