      <title>Unital embeddings of Cuntz algebras from path homomorphisms of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$, $n&gt;1$, are celebrated examples of a separable infinite simple C*-algebra with a number of fascinating properties. Their K-theory allows an embedding of $\mathcal O_m$ in $\mathcal O_n$ whenever $n-1$ divides $m-1$. In 2009, Kawamura provided a simple and explicit formula for all such embeddings. His formulas can be easily deduced by viewing Cuntz algebras as graph C*-algebras. Our main result is that, using both the covariant and contravariant functoriality of assigning graph C*-algebras to directed graphs, we can provide explicit polynomial formulas for all unital embeddings of Cuntz algebras into matrices over Cuntz algebras allowed by K-theory.</description>

      <title>Conformal transformations and equivariance in unbounded KK-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend unbounded Kasparov theory to encompass conformal group and quantum group equivariance. This new framework allows us to treat conformal actions on both manifolds and noncommutative spaces. As examples, we present unbounded representatives of Kasparov's $\gamma$-element for the Lorentz groups and display the conformal $SL_q(2)$-equivariance of the standard spectral triple of the Podle\'s sphere. In pursuing descent for conformally equivariant cycles, we are led to a new framework for representing Kasparov classes. Our new representatives are unbounded, possess a dynamical quality, and also include known twisted spectral triples. We define an equivalence relation on these new representatives whose classes form an abelian group surjecting onto KK. The technical innovation which underpins these results is a novel multiplicative perturbation theory. By these means, we obtain Kasparov classes from the bounded transform with minimal side conditions.</description>

      <title>Braided tensor product of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of braided tensor product $\operatorname{M}\overline{\boxtimes}\operatorname{N}$ of von Neumann algebras equipped with an action of a quasi-triangular quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ (this includes the case when $\mathbb{G}$ is a Drinfeld double). It is a new von Neumann algebra which comes together with embeddings of $\operatorname{M},\operatorname{N}$ and the unique action of $\mathbb{G}$ for which embeddings are equivariant. More generally, we construct braided tensor product of von Neumann algebras equipped with actions of locally compact quantum groups linked by a bicharacter. We study several examples, in particular we show that crossed products can be realised as braided tensor products. We also show that one can take the braided tensor product $\vartheta_1\boxtimes\vartheta_2$ of normal, completely bounded maps which are equivariant, but this fails without the equivariance condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the approximately inner automorphism group of a separable strongly stable von Neumann algebra is contractible in the u-topology. Thus the automorphism group of the hyperfinite III_1 factor is contractible.</description>

      <title>Classification of exchange relation planar algebras through sieving forest fusion graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a classification scheme for subfactorizable fusion bialgebras, particularly for exchange relation planar algebras. This scheme begins by transforming infinite diagrammatic consistency equations of exchange relations into a finite set of algebraic equations of degree at most 3. We then introduce a key concept, the fusion graph of a fusion bialgebra, and prove that the fusion graph for any minimal projection is a forest if and only if the planar algebra has an exchange relation. For each fusion graph, the system of degree 3 equations reduces to linear and quadratic equations that are efficiently solvable. To deal with exponentially many fusion graphs, we propose two novel analytic criteria to sieve most candidates from being subfactor planar algebras. Based on these results, we classify 5-dimensional subfactorizable fusion bialgebras with exchange relations. This scheme recovers the previous classification up to 4-dimension by Bisch, Jones, and the second author with quick proof. We developed a computer program to sieve forest fusion graphs using our criteria without solving the equations. The efficiency is 100%, as all remaining graphs are realized by exchange relation planar algebras up to 5-dimension.</description>

      <title>A vanishing theorem in $K$-theory for spectral projections of a non-periodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operator $H(\mu) = \nabla_{\bf A}^*\nabla_{\bf A} + \mu V$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry, where $\mu&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter, the magnetic field ${\bf B}=d{\bf A}$ and the electric potential $V$ are uniformly $C^\infty$-bounded, $V\geq 0$. We assume that, for some $E_0&gt;0$, each connected component of the sublevel set $\{V&lt;E_0\}$ of the potential $V$ is relatively compact. Under some assumptions on geometric and spectral properties of the connected components, we show that, for sufficiently large $\mu$, the spectrum of $H(\mu)$ in the interval $[0,E_0\mu]$ has a gap, the spectral projection of $H(\mu)$, corresponding to the interval $(-\infty,\lambda]$ with $\lambda$ in the gap, belongs to the Roe $C^*$-algebra $C^*(M)$ of the manifold $M$, and its class in the $K$ theory of $C^*(M)$ is trivial.</description>

      <title>$M$-Local type conditions for the $C^*$-crossed product and local trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local trajectories method establishes invertibility in algebras $\mathcal{B}= \alg(\mathcal{A}, U_G)$, for a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with a non-trivial center, and a unitary group $U_g$, $g\in G$, with $G$ a discrete group, assuming that $G$ is amenable and the action $a\mapsto U_gaU_g^*$ is topologically free. It is applicable in particular to $C^*$-algebras associated with convolution type operators with amenable groups of shifts.
  We introduce here an $M$-local type condition that allows to establish an isomorphism between $\cB$ and a $C^*$-crossed product, which is fundamental for the local trajectories method to work.
  We replace amenability of $G$ by the more general condition that action is amenable. The influence of the structure of the fixed points of the group action is analysed and a condition is introduced that applies when the action is not topologically free. If $\mathcal{A}$ is commutative, the referred conditions are related to the subalgebra $\alg(U_G)$ yielding, in particular, a sufficient condition that depends essentially on $U_G$. It is shown that in $\pi(\mathcal{B})= \alg(\pi(\mathcal{A}), \pi(U_G))$, with $\pi$ the local trajectories representation, the $M$-local type condition is verified, which allows establishing the isomorphism essential for the local trajectories method.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Cotlar identities for groups acting on tree-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T_m$ be a noncommutative Fourier multiplier. In recent work, Mei and Ricard introduced a noncommutative analogue of Cotlar's identity in order to prove that certain multipliers are bounded on the non-commutative $L_p$-spaces of a free group. Here, we study Cotlar type identities in full generality, giving a closed characterization for them in terms of $m$:
  \[
  \big( m(g h) - m(g) \big) \, \big( m(g^{-1}) - m(h) \big) = 0,
  \; \forall g \in \mathrm{G} \setminus \{e\}, h \in \mathrm{G}.
  \] We manage to prove, using a geometric argument, that if $X$ is a tree -- or more generally an $\mathbb{R}$-tree -- on which $\mathrm{G}$ acts and $m$ lifts to a function $\widetilde{m}: X \to \mathbb{C}$ that is constant on the connected subsets of $X \setminus \{x_0\}$, then $m$ satisfies Cotlar's identity and thus $T_m$ is bounded in $L_p$ for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. This result establishes a new connection between groups actions on $\mathbb{R}$-trees and Fourier multipliers. We show that $m$ is trivial when the action has global fixed points. This machinery allows us to simultaneously generalize the free group transforms of Mei and Ricard and the theory of Hilbert transforms in left-orderable groups, which follows from Arveson's subdiagonal algebras. Using Bass-Serre theory, we construct new examples of Fourier multipliers in groups. Those include new families like Baumslag-Solitar groups. We also show that a natural Hilbert transform in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ satisfies Cotlar's identity when restricted to the Bianchi group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-1}])$.</description>
