      <title>Two-octave frequency combs from all-silica-fiber implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared frequency comb spectroscopy enables measurement of molecular at megahertz spectral resolution, sub-hertz frequency accuracy and microsecond acquisition speed. However, the widespread adoption of this technique has been hindered by the complexity and alignment sensitivity of mid-infrared frequency comb sources. Leveraging the underexplored mid-infrared window of silica fibers presents a promising approach to address these challenges. In this study, we present the first experimental demonstration and quantitative numerical description of mid-infrared frequency comb generation in silica fibers. Our all-silica-fiber frequency comb spans over two octaves (0.8 $\mu$m to 3.5 $\mu$m) with a power output of 100 mW in the mid-infrared region. The amplified quantum noise is suppressed using four-cycle (25 fs) driving pulses, with the carrier-envelope offset frequency exhibiting a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB and a free-running bandwidth of 90 kHz. Our developed model provides quantitative guidelines for mid-infrared frequency comb generation in silica fibers, enabling all-fiber frequency comb spectroscopy in diverse fields such as organic synthesis, pharmacokinetics processes, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of vortex and vectorial vortex Pearcey-Gauss Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we put forward two new types of structured light beams, the vortex Pearcey-Gauss (VPeG) beam, with a homogeneous polarisation distribution, and the vector vortex Pearcey-Gauss (VVPeG) beam, with a non-homogeneous polarisation distribution. The later generated as a non-separable superposition of the spatial and polarisation degrees of freedom. We also achieve their experimental realization through the combination of a spatial light modulator, which creates a scalar Pearcey-Gauss beam, and a q-plate which transforms it into a vortex or a vortex vector beam, depending on its input polarisation state. Their intensity and polarisation distribution was performed through Stokes polarimetry, along the propagation direction, which was compared with numerical simulations. As demonstrated, the VVPeG beam evolves from a pure vector beam into a vector mode of quasi-homogeneous polarisation distribution. The proposed vector beams add to the already extensive family of non-separable states of light. We anticipate that both types of beams will find applications in fields as diverse as optical metrology, optical communications, and optical tweezers, amongst others.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Unmixing in Photoswitching Optoacoustic Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoacoustic (OA) imaging combined with reversibly photoswitchable proteins has emerged as a promising technology for the high-sensitivity and multiplexed imaging of cells in live tissues in preclinical research. Through carefully-designed illumination schedules of ON and OFF laser pulses, the resulting OA signal is a multiplex of different reporter species and the background. By exploiting their distinct inherent photo-physical properties which govern the rate of switching, one can recover the concentration maps of protein reporters from the temporally entangled OA images. In this paper, we propose a quantitative unmixing approach in the form of a regularized inversion algorithm based on a mathematical model of the temporal decay of the signal measuring the underlying protein reporters. We validate three types of reporters on simulated and experimental datasets and show successful unmixing results.</description>

      <title>Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in a natural van der Waals crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling light at subwavelength scales is one of the main challenges of nanophotonics. Leveraging hyperbolic polaritons supporting arbitrarily large wavevectors can lead to extreme light confinement, effectively overcoming the diffraction limit. Hyperbolicity was initially realized in artificial metamaterials, but their performances are limited by high losses in the metallic components and the constraint of long wavelengths. While recently discovered natural low-loss hyperbolic phonon polaritons initiated a revival in the interest for hyperbolic materials, they are confined to the mid-infrared frequency range, limiting their use for several applications. Some hyperbolic materials at visible frequencies have been studied, but they are either very lossy or only feature out-of-plane hyperbolicity. Here, we demonstrate the presence of low-loss, in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared in thin films of MoOCl2, a natural van der Waals crystal. The polariton dispersion is predicted based on the framework of light propagation in biaxial media, and experimentally confirmed by real space nano imaging on exfoliated flakes. MoOCl2 constitutes a novel material platform for visible-range applications leveraging the hyperbolic dispersion, such as hyperlensing, Purcell factor enhancement and super-resolution imaging, without the drawbacks of metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Sub-20 kHz low frequency noise near ultraviolet miniature external cavity laser diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact InGaN fiber Bragg grating (FBG) semiconductor laser diode operating below 400 nm in the single-mode emission regime. This compact coherent laser source exhibits an intrinsic linewidth of 14 kHz in the near-UV range and a side-mode suppression ratio reaching up to 40 dB accompanied by a mW-level output power. Furthermore, the properties of the FBG, including its central wavelength, bandwidth, and reflectivity, can be readily customized to fulfill specific requirements. As a result, the small footprint design of this laser is compatible with integration into a standard butterfly package to ease the lab-to-market technology transfer. The combination of low frequency noise and fibered output signal positions these FBG laser systems as strong candidates for hybridization with integrated photonic platforms tailored for quantum information processing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Confocal structured illumination microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confocal microscopy, a critical advancement in optical imaging, is widely applied because of its excellent anti-noise ability. However, it has low imaging efficiency and can cause phototoxicity. Optical-sectioning structured illumination microscopy (OS-SIM) can overcome the limitations of confocal microscopy but still face challenges in imaging depth and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We introduce the concept of confocal imaging into OS-SIM and propose confocal structured illumination microscopy (CSIM) to enhance the imaging performance of OS-SIM. CSIM exploits the principle of dual photography to reconstruct a dual image from each pixel of the camera. The reconstructed dual image is equivalent to the image obtained by using the spatial light modulator (SLM) as a virtual camera, enabling the separation of the conjugate and non-conjugate signals recorded by the camera pixel. We can reject the non-conjugate signals by extracting the conjugate signal from each dual image to reconstruct a confocal image when establishing the conjugate relationship between the camera and the SLM. We have constructed the theoretical framework of CSIM. Optical-sectioning experimental results demonstrate that CSIM can reconstruct images with superior SNR and greater imaging depth compared with existing OS-SIM. CSIM is expected to expand the application scope of OS-SIM.</description>

      <title>Chiral-Gain Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present an exploratory study of the potential applications of electrically biased materials that possess a nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian electromagnetic response analogous to the electronic response of field-effect transistors. The most distinctive feature of such materials is their chiral-gain, meaning that their response can be active or dissipative depending on the handedness of the wave polarization. Here, we show how the chiral-gain can be harnessed to develop novel electromagnetic devices with unique properties such as chiral lasers, polarization-dependent mirrors, and coherent-perfect-absorber lasers. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that materials with chiral-gain can bypass a reciprocity constraint that typically limits the external coupling strength, thus facilitating the excitation of cavities with extremely large quality factors.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Shear Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar dielectrics with low crystal symmetry and sharp phonon resonances can support hyperbolic shear polaritons - highly confined surface modes with frequency-dependent optical axes and asymmetric dissipation features. So far, these modes have been observed only in bulk natural materials at mid-infrared frequencies, with properties limited by available crystal geometries and phonon resonance strength. Here we introduce hyperbolic shear metasurfaces: ultrathin engineered surfaces supporting hyperbolic surface modes with symmetry-tailored axial dispersion and loss redistribution that can maximally enhance light-matter interactions. By engineering effective shear phenomena in these engineered surfaces, we demonstrate geometry-controlled, ultra-confined, low-loss hyperbolic surface waves with broadband Purcell enhancements, applicable across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>The electromagnetic symmetry sphere: a framework for energy, momentum, spin and other electromagnetic quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic quantities such as energy density, momentum, spin, and helicity bring meaning and intuition to electromagnetism and possess intricate interrelations, particularly prominent in complex non-paraxial near-fields. These quantities are conventionally expressed using electric and magnetic field vectors, yet the electric-magnetic basis is one among other often overlooked alternatives, including parallel-antiparallel and right-left-handed helicity bases, related to the parity and duality symmetries of electromagnetism. Projecting time-harmonic electromagnetic fields into a variety of bases allows re-interpreting established quantities and reveals underlying mathematical structures: a Bloch sphere which describes asymmetries in electromagnetic energy, a systematic path to unify and uncover relations between electromagnetic quantities, and the unlocking of symmetry-driven equations in light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Refractive index for the mechanical refraction of a relativistic particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analytically determined the refractive index for the mechanical refraction of a relativistic particle for its all possible speeds. We have critically analysed the importance of Descartes' metaphysical theory and extended it in this regard. We have considered the conservation of the tangential component of the relativistic momentum and the relativistic energy of the particle in the process of the mechanical refraction within the optical-mechanical analogy. Our result for the mechanical refractive index exactly matches with the forms of both the Fermat's result on Snell's law of optical refraction at the ultra-relativistic limit and the Descartes' metaphysical result on the pseudo-Snell law of optical refraction at the non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Generation of vortex electrons by atomic photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transfer from a twisted light beam to an electron in atomic ionization within the first Born approximation. The characteristics of the ejected electron are studied regardless of the detection scheme. We find that the outgoing electron possesses a definite projection of OAM when a single atom is located on the propagation axis of the photon, whereas the size of the electron wave packet is solely determined by the energy of the photon rather than by its transverse coherence length. Shifting the position of the atom yields a finite dispersion of the electron OAM. We also study a more experimentally feasible scenario -- a localized finite-sized atomic target -- and develop representative approaches to describing coherent and incoherent regimes of photoionization.</description>

      <title>Seamless Integration and Implementation of Distributed Contact and Contactless Vital Sign Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time vital sign monitoring is gaining immense significance not only in the medical field but also in personal health management. Facing the needs of different application scenarios of the smart and healthy city in the future, the low-cost, large-scale, scalable, and distributed vital sign monitoring system is of great significance. In this work, a seamlessly integrated contact and contactless vital sign monitoring system, which can simultaneously implement respiration and heartbeat monitoring, is proposed. In contact vital sign monitoring, the chest wall movement due to respiration and heartbeat is translated into changes in the optical output intensity of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The FBG is also an important part of radar signal generation for contactless vital sign monitoring, in which the chest wall movement is translated into phase changes of the radar de-chirped signal. By analyzing the intensity of the FBG output and phase of the radar de-chirped signal, real-time respiration and heartbeat monitoring are realized. In addition, due to the distributed structure of the system and its good integration with the wavelength-division multiplexing optical network, it can be massively scaled by employing more wavelengths. A proof-of-concept experiment is carried out. Contact and contactless respiration and heartbeat monitoring of three people are simultaneously realized. During a monitoring time of 60 s, the maximum absolute measurement errors of respiration and heartbeat rates are 1.6 respirations per minute and 2.3 beats per minute, respectively. The measurement error does not have an obvious change even when the monitoring time is decreased to 5 s.</description>

      <title>Model-free reinforcement learning with noisy actions for automated experimental control in optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental control involves a lot of manual effort with non-trivial decisions for precise adjustments. Here, we study the automatic experimental alignment for coupling laser light into an optical fiber using reinforcement learning (RL). We face several real-world challenges, such as time-consuming training, partial observability, and noisy actions due to imprecision in the mirror steering motors. We show that we can overcome these challenges: To save time, we use a virtual testbed to tune our environment for dealing with partial observability and use relatively sample-efficient model-free RL algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC). Furthermore, by fully training on the experiment, the agent learns directly to handle the noise present. In our extensive experimentation, we show that we are able to achieve 90% coupling, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. We reach this efficiency, which is comparable to that of a human expert, without additional feedback loops despite the motors' inaccuracies. Our result is an example of the readiness of RL for real-world tasks. We consider RL a promising tool for reducing the workload in labs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have emerged as a promising optical hardware platform for ultra-fast and energy-efficient signal processing for machine learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. Previous experimental demonstrations of DONNs have only been performed using coherent light. However, many real-world DONN applications require consideration of the spatial coherence properties of the optical signals. Here, we study the role of spatial coherence in DONN operation and performance. We propose a numerical approach to efficiently simulate DONNs under incoherent and partially coherent input illumination and discuss the corresponding computational complexity. As a demonstration, we train and evaluate simulated DONNs on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits to process light with varying spatial coherence.</description>

Abstract: The local density of states (LDOS) of electromagnetic field drives many basic processes associated to light-matter interaction such as the thermal emission of object, the spontaneous emission of quantum systems or the fluctuation-induced electromagnetic forces on molecules. Here, we study the LDOS in the close vicinity of magneto-optical metamaterials under the action of an external magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be efficiently changed in a narrow or a broad spectral range simply by changing the spatial orientation or the magnitude of this field. This result paves the way for an active control of the photonic density of states at deep-subwavelength scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04069v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly, single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.</description>

Abstract: Rapid progress in photonics has led to an explosion of integrated devices that promise to deliver the same performance as table-top technology at the nanoscale; heralding the next generation of optical communications, sensing and metrology, and quantum technologies. However, the challenge of co-integrating the multiple components of high-performance laser systems has left application of these nanoscale devices thwarted by bulky laser sources that are orders of magnitude larger than the devices themselves. Here we show that the two main ingredients for high-performance lasers -- noise reduction and isolation -- currently requiring serial combination of incompatible technologies, can be sourced simultaneously from a single, passive, CMOS-compatible nanophotonic device. To do this, we take advantage of both the long photon lifetime and the nonreciprocal Kerr nonlinearity of a high quality factor silicon nitride ring resonator to self-injection lock a semiconductor laser chip while also providing isolation. Additionally, we identify a previously unappreciated power regime limitation of current on-chip laser architectures which our system overcomes. Using our device, which we term a unified laser stabilizer, we demonstrate an on-chip integrated laser system with built-in isolation and noise reduction that operates with turnkey reliability. This approach departs from efforts to directly miniaturize and integrate traditional laser system components and serves to bridge the gap to fully integrated optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Quadrature-PT symmetry: Classical-to-quantum transition in noise fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While gain-loss-coupled photonic platforms have achieved significant success in studying classical parity-time (PT) symmetry, they encounter challenges in demonstrating pure quantum effects due to incompatible operator transformations and Langevin noise. Here, we present compelling evidence that a non-Hermitian (NH) twin-beam system, undergoing phase-sensitive amplification (PSA) and balanced loss, not only enables observing the usual eigenvalue-associated PT phase transition but also exhibits distinctive features absent in classical NH or Hermitian quantum scenarios, encompassing quadrature PT symmetry, anomalous loss-induced quadrature squeezing, and dynamical and stationary classical-to-quantum transitions in noise fluctuations. Furthermore, our proposed bipartite open system promises optimal sensing, showcasing an improved signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity, constrained by quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound or Fisher information. These findings deepen the comprehension of authentic quantum optical PT symmetry involving both gain and loss, addressing contentious issues and illuminating new facets of the subject.</description>

      <title>High-throughput quantum photonic devices emitting indistinguishable photons in the telecom C-band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single indistinguishable photons at telecom C-band wavelengths are essential for quantum networks and the future quantum internet. However, high-throughput technology for single-photon generation at 1550 nm remained a missing building block to overcome present limitations in quantum communication and information technologies. Here, we demonstrate the high-throughput fabrication of quantum-photonic integrated devices operating at C-band wavelengths based on epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots. Our technique enables the deterministic integration of single pre-selected quantum emitters into microcavities based on circular Bragg gratings. Respective devices feature the triggered generation of single photons with ultra-high purity and record-high photon indistinguishability. Further improvements in yield and coherence properties will pave the way for implementing single-photon non-linear devices and advanced quantum networks at telecom wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal entanglement in cavity magnomechanics exploiting chiral cavity-magnon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to achieve nonreciprocal quantum entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system by exploiting the chiral cavity-magnon coupling. The system consists of a magnon mode, a mechanical vibration mode, and two degenerate counter-propagating microwave cavity modes in a torus-shaped cavity. We show that nonreciprocal stationary microwave-magnon and -phonon bipartite entanglements and photon-magnon-phonon tripartite entanglement can be achieved by respectively driving different circulating cavity modes that hold a chiral coupling to the magnon mode. The nonreciprocal entanglements are shown to be robust against various experimental imperfections. We specifically show how such nonreciprocal entanglement can realize the channel multiplexing quantum teleportation. The work may find promising applications of the cavity magnomechanical systems in noise-tolerant quantum processing, channel multiplexing quantum teleportation, and chiral magnonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A new metric for the comparison of permittivity models in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a robust method, as well as a new metric, for the comparison of permittivity models in terahertz timedomain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). In this work, we perform an extensive noise analysis of a THz-TDS system, we remove and model the unwanted deterministic noises and implement them into our fitting process. This is done using our open-source software, Fit@TDS, available at : https://github.com/THzbiophotonics/Fit-TDS. This work is the first step towards the derivation of uncertainties, and therefore the use of error bars. We hope that this will lead to performing analytical analysis with THz-TDS, as results obtained from different setups will be comparable. Finally, we apply this protocol to the study of a $\alpha$-lactose monohydrate pellet in order to give more insight on the molecular dynamics behind the absorption peaks. The comparison with simulation results is made easier thanks to the probabilities derived from the metric.</description>
