      <title>Liquidity provision of utility indifference type in decentralized exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical formulation of liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges. We focus on constant function market makers of utility indifference type, which include constant product market makers with concentrated liquidity as a special case. First, we examine no-arbitrage conditions for a liquidity pool and compute an optimal arbitrage strategy when there is an external liquid market. Second, we show that liquidity provision suffers from impermanent loss unless a transaction fee is levied under the general framework with concentrated liquidity. Third, we establish the well-definedness of arbitrage-free reserve processes of a liquidity pool in continuous-time and show that there is no loss-versus-rebalancing under a nonzero fee if the external market price is continuous. We then argue that liquidity provision by multiple liquidity providers can be understood as liquidity provision by a representative liquidity provider, meaning that the analysis boils down to that for a single liquidity provider. Last, but not least, we give an answer to the fundamental question in which sense the very construction of constant function market makers with concentrated liquidity in the popular platform Uniswap v3 is optimal.</description>

      <title>FinRLlama: A Solution to LLM-Engineered Signals Challenge at FinRL Contest 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to Task II of the FinRL Challenge at ACM ICAIF 2024, this study proposes a novel prompt framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLM) with Reinforcement Learning from Market Feedback (RLMF). Our framework incorporates market-specific features and short-term price dynamics to generate more precise trading signals. Traditional LLMs, while competent in sentiment analysis, lack contextual alignment for financial market applications. To bridge this gap, we fine-tune the LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct model using a custom RLMF prompt design that integrates historical market data and reward-based feedback. Our evaluation shows that this RLMF-tuned framework outperforms baseline methods in signal consistency and achieving tighter trading outcomes; awarded as winner of Task II. You can find the code for this project on GitHub.</description>
