      <title>Planning with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications: Handling Quantifiable and Unquantifiable Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the planning problem for robotic systems under both quantifiable and unquantifiable uncertainty. The objective is to enable the robotic systems to optimally fulfill high-level tasks specified by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. To capture both types of uncertainty in a unified modelling framework, we utilise Markov Decision Processes with Set-valued Transitions (MDPSTs). We introduce a novel solution technique for the optimal robust strategy synthesis of MDPSTs with LTL specifications. To improve efficiency, our work leverages limit-deterministic B\"uchi automata (LDBAs) as the automaton representation for LTL to take advantage of their efficient constructions. To tackle the inherent nondeterminism in MDPSTs, which presents a significant challenge for reducing the LTL planning problem to a reachability problem, we introduce the concept of a Winning Region (WR) for MDPSTs. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for computing the WR over the product of the MDPST and the LDBA. Finally, a robust value iteration algorithm is invoked to solve the reachability problem. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study involving a mobile robot operating in the hexagonal world, demonstrating promising efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>Digital Convexity and Combinatorics on Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An upward (resp.~downward) digitally convex word is a binary word that best approximates from below (resp.~from above) an upward (resp.~downward) convex curve in the plane. We study these words from the combinatorial point of view, formalizing their geometrical properties and highlighting connections with Christoffel words and finite Sturmian words. In particular, we study from the combinatorial perspective the operations of inflation and deflation on digitally convex words.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>
