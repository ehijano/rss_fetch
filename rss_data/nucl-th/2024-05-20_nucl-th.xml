      <title>Proto-neutron stars with quark cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the evolution of proto-neutron stars (PNSs) from birth as neutrino-rich objects to maturity as cold-catalyzed neutrino-poor objects with nucleonic and non-nucleonic degrees of freedom. The focus is on the star's core where the nucleons, hyperons, and the $\Delta$-isobars are expected to dissolve into a "soup" of deconfined quarks, at higher baryon densities, to establish a possible hadron-quark phase transition. We separately calculate the nuclear equations of state (EoS) for the hadronic matter (composed of all the baryon octet and $\Delta$-isobars) and the strange quark matter (SQM) under the same thermodynamic conditions characteristic of PNS and proto-strange star (PSS) evolution and construct the hybrid EoS using Maxwell's construction. The study allows us to determine the hadron-quark phase transitions along the evolution lines of the star. We observed a phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter (QM) phase when the neutrinos have completely escaped from the star's core. The EoSs utilized are constrained to meet the $2\,\rm M_\odot$ threshold in accordance with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Renormalizability of the leading order operator for neutrinoless double beta decay with the effects of finite nucleon size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental process of neutrinoless double beta decay, $nn\to ppe^-e^-$, dominated by the exchange of light Majorana neutrinos, is studied in the framework of chiral effective field theory. Considering neutrinos as virtual states, we evaluate the contributions of finite nucleon size to the transition amplitude in a non-perturbative manner, as opposed to expanding these effects in powers of momentum. Based on the nucleon form factors expressed in terms of the dipole and Kelly parametrizations, we find that, at the leading order, the present scheme could renormalize the amplitude in the context of the standard mechanism and provide predictions consistent with the previous investigations. Consequently, we argue that the impact of the effects of finite nucleon size on the amplitude is comparable to that of the leading-order contact term introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett.120, 202001(2018)] in a perturbative scheme. Our results provide not only a benchmark calculation for the transition amplitude between two schemes but also evidence for the reasonableness of non-perturbative treatment for the effects of finite nucleon size in conventional nuclear many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Model orthogonalization and Bayesian forecast mixing via Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One can improve predictability in the unknown domain by combining forecasts of imperfect complex computational models using a Bayesian statistical machine learning framework. In many cases, however, the models used in the mixing process are similar. In addition to contaminating the model space, the existence of such similar, or even redundant, models during the multimodeling process can result in misinterpretation of results and deterioration of predictive performance. In this work we describe a method based on the Principal Component Analysis that eliminates model redundancy. We show that by adding model orthogonalization to the proposed Bayesian Model Combination framework, one can arrive at better prediction accuracy and reach excellent uncertainty quantification performance.</description>

      <title>The Convergence Problem Of Gradient Expansion In The Relaxation Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Modelling stochastic fluctuations in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the information current, we develop a Lorentz-covariant framework for modeling equilibrium fluctuations in relativistic kinetic theory in the grand-canonical ensemble. The resulting stochastic theory is proven to be causal and covariantly stable, and its predictions do not depend on the choice of spacetime foliation used to define the grand-canonical probabilities. As expected, in a box containing $N{&gt;}5$ particles, Boltzmann's molecular chaos postulate is broken with (almost exact) probability $N^{-1/2}$, leading to a breakdown of the Boltzmann equation in small systems. We also verify that, in ultrarelativistic gases, transient hydrodynamics already accounts for at least 80% of the equilibrium fluctuations of the stress-energy tensor at a given time. Finally, we compute the correlators at non-equal times for two selected collision kernels: That of a chemically active diluted solution, and that of ultrarelativistic scalar particles self-interacting via a quartic potential. For the former, we compute the density-density correlators analytically in real space, and dehydrodynamization of the stochastic theory is proven to occur whenever the mean free path diverges at high energy.</description>

      <title>Analytical insights into the interplay of momentum, multiplicity and the speed of sound in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions to study the relation between the speed of sound of the produced plasma and the final particles' energy and multiplicity. We discuss how the particles' multiplicity $N_{\textrm{tot}}$ and average energy $E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}}$ is related to the speed of sound $c_s$ by $c_s^2=d \ln (E_{\textrm{tot}}/N_{\textrm{tot}})/d\ln N_{\textrm{tot}}$ if the fluid is inviscid, its speed of sound is constant and all final particles can be measured. We show that finite rapidity cuts on the particles' multiplicity $N$ and energy $E$ introduce corrections between $c_s^2$ and $d \ln (E/N)/d\ln N$ that depend on the system's lifetime. We study analytically these deviations with the Gubser hydrodynamic solution, finding that, for ultrarelativistic bosons, they scale as the ratio of the freezeout temperature $T_{\mathrm{FO}}$ over the maximum initial temperature of the fluid $T_{0}$; the non-thermodynamic aspect of these corrections is highlighted through their dependence on the system's initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Solar Models and Astrophysical S-factors Constrained by Helioseismic Results and Updated Neutrino Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ratio of metal abundance to hydrogen abundance of the solar photosphere, $(Z/X)_{s}$, has been revised several times. Standard solar models, based on these revised solar abundances, are in disagreement with seismically inferred results. Recently, Magg et al. introduced a new value for $(Z/X)_{s}$, which is still in debate in the community. The solar abundance problem or solar modeling problem remains a topic of ongoing debate. We constructed rotating solar models in accordance with various abundance scales where the effects of convection overshoot and enhanced diffusion were included. Among these models, those utilizing Magg's abundance scale exhibit superior sound-speed and density profiles compared to models using other abundance scales. Additionally, they reproduce the observed frequency separation ratios $r_{02}$ and $r_{13}$. These models also match the seismically inferred surface helium abundance and convection zone depth within $1\sigma$ level. Furthermore, the calculated neutrino fluxes from these models agree with detected ones at the level of $1\sigma$. We found that neutrino fluxes and density profile are influenced by nuclear reactions, allowing us to use the combination of detected neutrino fluxes and seismically inferred density for diagnosing astrophysical $S$-factors. This diagnostic approach shows that $S_{11}$ may be underestimated by $2\%$, while $S_{33}$ may be overestimated by about $3\%$ in previous determinations. The $S$-factors favored by updated neutrino fluxes and helioseismic results can lead to significant improvements in solar models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Accurate Surrogates for Simulations of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly used to build computationally inexpensive surrogates for complex physical models. The predictive capability of these surrogates suffers when data are noisy, sparse, or time-dependent. As we are interested in finding a surrogate that provides valid predictions of any potential future model evaluations, we introduce an online learning method empowered by optimizer-driven sampling. The method has two advantages over current approaches. First, it ensures that all turning points on the model response surface are included in the training data. Second, after any new model evaluations, surrogates are tested and "retrained" (updated) if the "score" drops below a validity threshold. Tests on benchmark functions reveal that optimizer-directed sampling generally outperforms traditional sampling methods in terms of accuracy around local extrema, even when the scoring metric favors overall accuracy. We apply our method to simulations of nuclear matter to demonstrate that highly accurate surrogates for the nuclear equation of state can be reliably auto-generated from expensive calculations using a few model evaluations.</description>

      <title>Impact of global monopole on heavy mesons in hot-dense medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research study is primarily focus on investigating how the topological effects influence the eigenvalue solutions in the presence of a hot-dense medium. To accomplish this, we employ the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger wave equation, taking into consideration both the quantum flux field and an interaction potential. Through this approach, we determine the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our findings indicate that when we consider both the topological effects and the magnetic flux, $\Phi$, there is a noticeable reduction in the binding energy within the hot-dense medium. Additionally, we analyze the role of the baryonic potential in shaping the binding energy within the $(T, u_b)$ plane. Interestingly, it is evident that the influence of the baryonic potential becomes more pronounced as its values decrease</description>

      <title>Generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized thermodynamic relations are introduced into the framework of a relativistic perfect spin hydrodynamics. They allow for consistent treatment of spin degrees of freedom, including the use of spin tensors whose structure follows from microscopic calculations. The obtained results are important for establishing consistency between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics and form the basis for introducing dissipative corrections.</description>
