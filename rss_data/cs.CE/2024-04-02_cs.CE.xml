      <title>A Stackelberg Regret Minimizing Framework for Online Learning in Newsvendor Pricing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the application of online learning in a Stackelberg game pertaining to a system with two learning agents in a dyadic exchange network, consisting of a supplier and retailer, specifically where the parameters of the demand function are unknown. In this game, the supplier is the first-moving leader, and must determine the optimal wholesale price of the product. Subsequently, the retailer who is the follower, must determine both the optimal procurement amount and selling price of the product. In the perfect information setting, this is known as the classical price-setting Newsvendor problem, and we prove the existence of a unique Stackelberg equilibrium when extending this to a two-player pricing game. In the framework of online learning, the parameters of the reward function for both the follower and leader must be learned, under the assumption that the follower will best respond with optimism under uncertainty. A novel algorithm based on contextual linear bandits with a measurable uncertainty set is used to provide a confidence bound on the parameters of the stochastic demand. Consequently, optimal finite time regret bounds on the Stackelberg regret, along with convergence guarantees to an approximate Stackelberg equilibrium, are provided.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Intelligent Recommender system as a first step resilience measure -- A data-driven supply chain disruption response framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interests in the value of digital technologies for its potential uses to increase supply chain resilience (SCRes) are increasing in light to the industry 4.0 and the global pandemic. Utilization of Recommender systems (RS) as a supply chain (SC) resilience measure is neglected although RS is a capable tool to enhance SC resilience from a reactive aspect. To address this problem, this research proposed a novel data-driven supply chain disruption response framework based on the intelligent recommender system techniques and validated the conceptual model through a practical use case. Results show that our framework can be implemented as an effective SC disruption mitigation measure in the very first response phrase and help SC participants get better reaction performance after the SC disruption.</description>

      <title>Data Analytics for Improving Energy Efficiency in Short Sea Shipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the urgent requirements for the climate change mitigation, several proactive measures of energy efficiency have been implemented in maritime industry. Many of these practices depend highly on the onboard data of vessel's operation and environmental conditions. In this paper, a high resolution onboard data from passenger vessels in short-sea shipping (SSS) have been collected and preprocessed. We first investigated the available data to deploy it effectively to model the physics of the vessel, and hence the vessel performance. Since in SSS, the weather measurements and forecasts might have not been in temporal and spatial resolutions that accurately representing the actual environmental conditions. Then, We proposed a data-driven modeling approach for vessel energy efficiency. This approach addresses the challenges of data representation and energy modeling by combining and aggregating data from multiple sources and seamlessly integrates explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to attain clear insights about the energy efficiency for a vessel in SSS. After that, the developed model of energy efficiency has been utilized in developing a framework for optimizing the vessel voyage to minimize the fuel consumption and meeting the constraint of arrival time. Moreover, we developed a spatial clustering approach for labeling the vessel paths to detect the paths for vessels with operating routes of repeatable and semi-repeatable paths.</description>

      <title>Evaluatology: The Science and Engineering of Evaluation</title>

Abstract: Evaluation is a crucial aspect of human existence and plays a vital role in various fields. However, it is often approached in an empirical and ad-hoc manner, lacking consensus on universal concepts, terminologies, theories, and methodologies. This lack of agreement has significant repercussions. This article aims to formally introduce the discipline of evaluatology, which encompasses the science and engineering of evaluation. We propose a universal framework for evaluation, encompassing concepts, terminologies, theories, and methodologies that can be applied across various disciplines.
  Our research reveals that the essence of evaluation lies in conducting experiments that intentionally apply a well-defined evaluation condition to diverse subjects and infer the impact of different subjects by measuring and/or testing. Derived from the essence of evaluation, we propose five axioms focusing on key aspects of evaluation outcomes as the foundational evaluation theory. These axioms serve as the bedrock upon which we build universal evaluation theories and methodologies. When evaluating a single subject, it is crucial to create evaluation conditions with different levels of equivalency. By applying these conditions to diverse subjects, we can establish reference evaluation models. These models allow us to alter a single independent variable at a time while keeping all other variables as controls. When evaluating complex scenarios, the key lies in establishing a series of evaluation models that maintain transitivity. Building upon the science of evaluation, we propose a formal definition of a benchmark as a simplified and sampled evaluation condition that guarantees different levels of equivalency. This concept serves as the cornerstone for a universal benchmark-based engineering approach to evaluation across various disciplines, which we refer to as benchmarkology.</description>

      <title>A finite operator learning technique for mapping the elastic properties of microstructures to their mechanical deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To develop faster solvers for governing physical equations in solid mechanics, we introduce a method that parametrically learns the solution to mechanical equilibrium. The introduced method outperforms traditional ones in terms of computational cost while acceptably maintaining accuracy. Moreover, it generalizes and enhances the standard physics-informed neural networks to learn a parametric solution with rather sharp discontinuities. We focus on micromechanics as an example, where the knowledge of the micro-mechanical solution, i.e., deformation and stress fields for a given heterogeneous microstructure, is crucial. The parameter under investigation is the Young modulus distribution within the heterogeneous solid system. Our method, inspired by operator learning and the finite element method, demonstrates the ability to train without relying on data from other numerical solvers. Instead, we leverage ideas from the finite element approach to efficiently set up loss functions algebraically, particularly based on the discretized weak form of the governing equations. Notably, our investigations reveal that physics-based training yields higher accuracy compared to purely data-driven approaches for unseen microstructures. In essence, this method achieves independence from data and enhances accuracy for predictions beyond the training range. The aforementioned observations apply here to heterogeneous elastic microstructures. Comparisons are also made with other well-known operator learning algorithms, such as DeepOnet, to further emphasize the advantages of the newly proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Clustering for Protein Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein representation learning is a challenging task that aims to capture the structure and function of proteins from their amino acid sequences. Previous methods largely ignored the fact that not all amino acids are equally important for protein folding and activity. In this article, we propose a neural clustering framework that can automatically discover the critical components of a protein by considering both its primary and tertiary structure information. Our framework treats a protein as a graph, where each node represents an amino acid and each edge represents a spatial or sequential connection between amino acids. We then apply an iterative clustering strategy to group the nodes into clusters based on their 1D and 3D positions and assign scores to each cluster. We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering, until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein. We evaluate on four protein-related tasks: protein fold classification, enzyme reaction classification, gene ontology term prediction, and enzyme commission number prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>From attention to profit: quantitative trading strategy based on transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional quantitative trading practice, navigating the complicated and dynamic financial market presents a persistent challenge. Former machine learning approaches have struggled to fully capture various market variables, often ignore long-term information and fail to catch up with essential signals that may lead the profit. This paper introduces an enhanced transformer architecture and designs a novel factor based on the model. By transfer learning from sentiment analysis, the proposed model not only exploits its original inherent advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and modelling complex data relationships but is also able to solve tasks with numerical inputs and accurately forecast future returns over a period. This work collects more than 5,000,000 rolling data of 4,601 stocks in the Chinese capital market from 2010 to 2019. The results of this study demonstrated the model's superior performance in predicting stock trends compared with other 100 factor-based quantitative strategies with lower turnover rates and a more robust half-life period. Notably, the model's innovative use transformer to establish factors, in conjunction with market sentiment information, has been shown to enhance the accuracy of trading signals significantly, thereby offering promising implications for the future of quantitative trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Pressure Management Strategies for Geological CO2 Sequestration Using Surrogate Model-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Injecting greenhouse gas into deep underground reservoirs for permanent storage can inadvertently lead to fault reactivation, caprock fracturing and greenhouse gas leakage when the injection-induced stress exceeds the critical threshold. Extraction of pre-existing fluids at various stages of injection process, referred as pressure management, can mitigate associated risks and lessen environmental impact. However, identifying optimal pressure management strategies typically requires thousands of full-order simulations due to the need for function evaluations, making the process computationally prohibitive. This paper introduces a novel surrogate model-based reinforcement learning method for devising optimal pressure management strategies for geological CO2 sequestration efficiently. Our approach comprises two steps. Firstly, a surrogate model is developed through the embed to control method, which employs an encoder-transition-decoder structure to learn latent dynamics. Leveraging this proxy model, reinforcement learning is utilized to find an optimal strategy that maximizes economic benefits while satisfying various control constraints. The reinforcement learning agent receives the latent state space representation and immediate reward tailored for CO2 sequestration and choose real-time controls which are subject to predefined engineering constraints in order to maximize the long-term cumulative rewards. To demonstrate its effectiveness, this framework is applied to a compositional simulation model where CO2 is injected into saline aquifer. The results reveal that our surrogate model-based reinforcement learning approach significantly optimizes CO2 sequestration strategies, leading to notable economic gains compared to baseline scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modal-adaptive Knowledge-enhanced Graph-based Financial Prediction from Monetary Policy Conference Calls with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial prediction from Monetary Policy Conference (MPC) calls is a new yet challenging task, which targets at predicting the price movement and volatility for specific financial assets by analyzing multimodal information including text, video, and audio. Although the existing work has achieved great success using cross-modal transformer blocks, it overlooks the potential external financial knowledge, the varying contributions of different modalities to financial prediction, as well as the innate relations among different financial assets. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Modal-Adaptive kNowledge-enhAnced Graph-basEd financial pRediction scheme, named MANAGER. Specifically, MANAGER resorts to FinDKG to obtain the external related knowledge for the input text. Meanwhile, MANAGER adopts BEiT-3 and Hidden-unit BERT (HuBERT) to extract the video and audio features, respectively. Thereafter, MANAGER introduces a novel knowledge-enhanced cross-modal graph that fully characterizes the semantic relations among text, external knowledge, video and audio, to adaptively utilize the information in different modalities, with ChatGLM2 as the backbone. Extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset Monopoly verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning model based on the transformer architecture to predict the load-deformation behavior of large bored piles in Bangkok subsoil. The model encodes the soil profile and pile features as tokenization input, and generates the load-deformation curve as output. The model also incorporates the previous sequential data of load-deformation curve into the decoder to improve the prediction accuracy. The model also incorporates the previous sequential data of load-deformation curve into the decoder. The model shows a satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability for the load-deformation curve prediction, with a mean absolute error of 5.72% for the test data. The model could also be used for parametric analysis and design optimization of piles under different soil and pile conditions, pile cross section, pile length and type of pile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing research indicates that their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus by a substantial margin. To accomplish this, we propose SMolInstruct, a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality dataset for instruction tuning. It contains 14 selected chemistry tasks and over three million samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Using SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. Our analysis further demonstrates the critical role of the proposed dataset in driving the performance improvements.</description>
