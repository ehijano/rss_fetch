      <title>Interior point methods for an algebraic system involving complementarity equations for geomechanical fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications like subseismic fault modeling, fractured reservoir modeling and interpretation/validation of fault connectivity involve the solution to an elliptic boundary value problem in a background medium perturbed by the presence of cracks that take the form of one or many pieces of surface (with boundary). When the background medium can be considered as homogeneous, boundary integral equations appear as a method of choice for the numerical solution to fractures problems. With such an approach, the problem is reformulated as a fully non-local equation posed at the surface of cracks. Discretization of boundary integral resulting in the so-called Boundary Element Method (BEM) leads to densely populated matrices due to the full non-locality of the operators under consideration. After the discretization process, geologists are faced with a system of equations that turns out difficult to solve numerically. Many empirical algorithms have been proposed by geologists to solve this system of equations. Unfortunately, none of them is guaranteed to converge in theory (in particular when faults (fractures) intersect each other forming a geometrically highly irregular structure). In practice, none of them appears to be either robust or efficient. We investigate another approach, referred to as interior point methods, for which convergence can be ensured (even if faults are too close). Interior point methods have proved their efficiency in a wide variety of domains, most notably for linear programming. Here, even though we do not have any optimization problem, we can adapt ideas from interior point methods for the numerical resolution of the system considered. The numerical results obtained demonstrate computational efficiency and accuracy, highlighting the robustness and effectiveness of the implemented methods.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Newton Method for Set Optimization Problems with Set-Valued Mapping Given by Finitely Many Vector-Valued Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a quasi-Newton method for unconstrained set optimization problems to find its weakly minimal solutions with respect to lower set-less ordering. The set-valued objective mapping under consideration is given by a finite number of vector-valued functions that are twice continuously differentiable. To find the necessary optimality condition for weak minimal points with the help of the proposed quasi-Newton method, we use the concept of partition and formulate a family of vector optimization problems. The evaluation of necessary optimality condition for finding the weakly minimal points involves the computation of the approximate Hessian of every objective function, which is done by a quasi-Newton scheme for vector optimization problems. In the proposed quasi-Newton method, we derive a sequence of iterative points that exhibits convergence to a point which satisfies the derived necessary optimality condition for weakly minimal points. After that, we find a descent direction for a suitably chosen vector optimization problem from this family of vector optimization problems and update from the current iterate to the next iterate. The proposed quasi-Newton method for set optimization problems is not a direct extension of that for vector optimization problems, as the selected vector optimization problem varies across the iterates. The well-definedness and convergence of the proposed method are analyzed. The convergence of the proposed algorithm under some regularity condition of the stationary points, a condition on nonstationary points, the boundedness of the norm of quasi-Newton direction, and the existence of step length that satisfies the Armijo condition are derived. We obtain a local superlinear convergence of the proposed method under uniform continuity of the Hessian approximation function.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Strategies for Backward Linear-Quadratic Mean Field Games and Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a new class of linear-quadratic mean field games and teams problem, where the large-population system satisfies a class of $N$ weakly coupled linear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), and $z_i$ (a part of solution of BSDE) enter the state equations and cost functionals. By virtue of stochastic maximum principle and optimal filter technique, we obtain a Hamiltonian system first, which is a fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE). Decoupling the Hamiltonian system, we derive a feedback form optimal strategy by introducing Riccati equations, stochastic differential equation (SDE) and BSDE. Finally, we provide a numerical example to simulate our results.</description>

      <title>Stability Exchange near Folds: Analysis of an end-loaded Elastica with a Lever Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous problems in physical sciences can be expressed as parameter-dependent variational problems. The associated family of equilibria may or may not exist realistically and can be determined after examining its stability. Hence, it is crucial to determine the stability and track its transitions. Generally, the stability characteristics of the equilibria change near the folds in the parameter space. The direction of stability change can be encoded through a particular projection of the solutions. In this article, we identify such projections for variational problems characterized by fixed-free ends, a class of problems frequently found in mechanics. Using the developed theory, we study an Elastica subject to an end load applied through a rigid lever arm. The examples revealed several instances of snap-back instability in these systems. These findings may aid in enhancing the design of soft robot arms and other innovative switching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Inexact Catching-Up Algorithm for Moreau's Sweeping Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an inexact version of the catching-up algorithm for sweeping processes. We define a new notion of approximate projection, which is compatible with any numerical method for approximating exact projections, as this new notion is not restricted to remain strictly within the set. We provide several properties of the new approximate projections, which enable us to prove the convergence of the inexact catching-up algorithm in three general frameworks: prox-regular moving sets, subsmooth moving sets, and merely closed sets. Additionally, we apply our numerical results to address complementarity dynamical systems, particularly electrical circuits with ideal diodes. In this context, we implement the inexact catching-up algorithm using a primal-dual optimization method, which typically does not necessarily guarantee a feasible point. Our results are illustrated through an electrical circuit with ideal diodes. Our results recover classical existence results in the literature and provide new insights into the numerical simulation of sweeping processes.</description>

      <title>Extended formulations for the multilinear polytope of acyclic hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of our joint work on binary polynomial optimization over the past decade. We define the multilinear polytope as the convex hull of the feasible region of a linearized binary polynomial optimization problem. By representing the multilinear polytope with hypergraphs, we investigate the connections between hypergraph acyclicity and the complexity of the facial structure of the multilinear polytope. We characterize the acyclic hypergraphs for which a polynomial-size extended formulation for the multilinear polytope can be constructed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Multi-step Inertial Accelerated Doubly Stochastic Gradient Methods for Block Term Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a specific optimization problem that combines a differentiable nonconvex function with a nondifferentiable function for multi-block variables, which is particularly relevant to tackle the multilinear rank-($L_r$,$L_r$,1) block-term tensor decomposition model with a regularization term. While existing algorithms often suffer from high per-iteration complexity and slow convergence, this paper employs a unified multi-step inertial accelerated doubly stochastic gradient descent method tailored for structured rank-$\left(L_r, L_r, 1\right)$ tensor decomposition, referred to as Midas-LL1. We also introduce an extended multi-step variance-reduced stochastic estimator framework. Our analysis under this new framework demonstrates the subsequential and sequential convergence of the proposed algorithm under certain conditions and illustrates the sublinear convergence rate of the subsequence, showing that the Midas-LL1 algorithm requires at most $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations in expectation to reach an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on several datasets, and the results indicate that Midas-LL1 outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both computational speed and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Projected proximal gradient trust-region algorithm for nonsmooth optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider trust-region methods for solving optimization problems where the objective is the sum of a smooth, nonconvex function and a nonsmooth, convex regularizer. We extend the global convergence theory of such methods to include worst-case complexity bounds in the case of unbounded model Hessian growth, and introduce a new, simple nonsmooth trust-region subproblem solver based on combining several iterations of proximal gradient descent with a single projection into the trust region, which meets the sufficient descent requirements for algorithm convergence and has promising numerical results.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete Systems for Quasi Variational Inequalities with Application to Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of projected dynamical systems of third order is investigated for quasi (parametric) variational inequalities in which the convex set in the classical variational inequality also depends upon the solution explicitly or implicitly. We study the stability of a continuous method of a gradient type. Some iterative implicit and explicit schemes are suggested as counterparts of the continuous case by inertial proximal methods. The convergence analysis of these proposed methods is established under sufficient mild conditions. Moreover, some applications dealing with the generalized Nash equilibrium problems are presented.</description>

      <title>Algebraic characterization of equivalence between optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When are two algorithms the same? How can we be sure a recently proposed algorithm is novel, and not a minor twist on an existing method? In this paper, we present a framework for reasoning about equivalence between a broad class of iterative algorithms, with a focus on algorithms designed for convex optimization. We propose several notions of what it means for two algorithms to be equivalent, and provide computationally tractable means to detect equivalence. Our main definition, oracle equivalence, states that two algorithms are equivalent if they result in the same sequence of calls to the function oracles (for suitable initialization). Borrowing from control theory, we use state-space realizations to represent algorithms and characterize algorithm equivalence via transfer functions. Our framework can also identify and characterize equivalence between algorithms that use different oracles that are related via a linear fractional transformation. Prominent examples include linear transformations and function conjugation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing provides a novel approach to addressing conventionally intractable issues in large-scale optimization. Space logistics missions require the efficient routing of payloads, spacecraft, and resources across complex networks, often resulting in an exponential growth of the solution space that classical methods cannot efficiently solve. This paper leverages entropy quantum computing to model and solve the space logistics problem as a time-dependent multicommodity network flow, enabling the exploration of large solution spaces. The findings highlight quantum computing's potential to address complex aerospace logistics, demonstrating its suitability for complex interplanetary mission planning.</description>

      <title>Cover-Relax-Search: A Primal Heuristic for Binary Quadratic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Quadratic Programs (BQPs) are a class of NP-hard problems that arise in a wide range of applications, including finance, machine learning, and logistics. These problems are challenging to solve due to the combinatorial search space and nonlinearity. In fact, this class of optimization problems is so challenging that, in many instances, standard algorithms struggle to identify feasible solutions within a reasonable time. Primal heuristic algorithms have been developed to quickly identify feasible solutions to BQPs. In this paper, we propose Cover-Relax-Search, an efficient primal heuristic for BQPs. This approach is inspired by multiple local search algorithms, including Undercover. We evaluate the \emph{Cover-Relax-Search} algorithm on multiple BQP benchmarks and show that our proposed heuristic identifies high-quality solutions at a faster speed and significantly reduces the primal integral compared to state-of-the-art solvers and other local search baselines.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Mixed-Integer Formulation and an Iterative Method for Optimal Control of Switched Systems Under Dwell Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) formulation for systems with discrete control inputs under dwell time constraints. By viewing such systems as a switched system, the problem is decomposed into a Sequence Optimization (SO) and a Switching Time Optimization (STO) -- the former providing the sequence of the switched system, and the latter calculating the optimal switching times. By limiting the feasible set of SO to subsequences of a master sequence, this formulation requires a small number of binary variables, independent of the number of time discretization nodes. This enables the proposed formulation to provide solutions efficiently, even for large numbers of time discretization nodes. To provide even faster solutions, an iterative algorithm is introduced to heuristically solve STO and SO. The proposed approaches are then showcased on four different switched systems and results demonstrate the efficiency of the MINLP formulation and the iterative algorithm.</description>

      <title>KLAP: KYP lemma based low-rank approximation for $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel passivity enforcement (passivation) method, called KLAP, for linear time-invariant systems based on the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma and the closely related Lur'e equations. The passivation problem in our framework corresponds to finding a perturbation to a given non-passive system that renders the system passive while minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_2$ or frequency-weighted $\mathcal{H}_2$ distance between the original non-passive and the resulting passive system. We show that this problem can be formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem whose objective function can be differentiated efficiently even in large-scale settings. We show that any minimizer of the unconstrained problem yields the same passive system. Furthermore, we prove that, in the absence of a feedthrough term, every local minimizer is also a global minimizer. For cases involving a non-trivial feedthrough term, we analyze global minimizers in relation to the extremal solutions of the Lur'e equations, which can serve as tools for identifying local minima. To solve the resulting numerical optimization problem efficiently, we propose an initialization strategy based on modifying the feedthrough term and a restart strategy when it is likely that the optimization has converged to a local minimum. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On Coordinated Drone-Courier Logistics for Intra-city Express Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Problem definition: Drones, despite being acknowledged as a transformative force in the city logistics sector, are unable to execute the \textit{last-meter delivery} (unloading goods directly to customers' doorsteps) due to airspace restrictions and safety concerns. To leverage advancements and overcome the limitations of drones in providing intra-city express services, we introduce a coordinated drone-courier logistics system where drones operate within a closed network among vertiports, while couriers connect customers to the drone delivery system. This paper aims to shed light on this coordinated system in terms of system feasibility, network interactivity, and long-term sustainability. Methodology/Results: We develop an integrated optimization model to optimize the network planning of the coordinated logistics system. The interplay between network planning and tactical operations is mirrored by a queueing network model, resulting in the nonlinear and nonconvex (partially convex and partially concave) feasible region of the optimization model. An iterative exact algorithm that tightens lower and upper bounds by adaptively refining the linear approximations of nonlinear constraints is developed to provide optimality-guaranteed solutions with finite convergence. The computational experiments demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our algorithm across various network configurations and scenarios.Managerial implications: The case study, based on a real-world dataset from SF Express, a logistics giant in China, validates that the coordinated logistics system efficiently attains cost and time savings by leveraging the effective turnover of drones and the coordination between drones and couriers. The optimal network design features a concentrated structure, streamlining demand consolidation and reducing deadhead repositioning.</description>

      <title>Control of Overpopulated Tails in Kinetic Epidemic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce model-based transition rates for controlled compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology, with a focus on the effects of control strategies applied to interacting multi-agent systems describing contact formation dynamics. In the framework of kinetic control problems, we compare two prototypical control protocols: one additive control directly influencing the dynamics and another targeting the interaction strength between agents. The emerging controlled macroscopic models are derived for an SIR compartmentalization to illustrate their impact on epidemic progression and contact interaction dynamics. Numerical results show the effectiveness of this approach in steering the dynamics and controlling epidemic trends, even in scenarios where contact distributions exhibit an overpopulated tail.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of almost-honeycomb structures in low-energy planar clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several commonly observed physical and biological systems are arranged in shapes that closely resemble an honeycomb cluster, that is, a tessellation of the plane by regular hexagons. Although these shapes are not always the direct product of energy minimization, they can still be understood, at least phenomenologically, as low-energy configurations. In this paper, explicit quantitative estimates on the geometry of such low-energy configurations are provided, showing in particular that the vast majority of the chambers must be generalized polygons with six edges, and be closely resembling regular hexagons. Part of our arguments is a detailed revision of the estimates behind the global isoperimetric principle for honeycomb clusters due to Hales (T. C. Hales. The honeycomb conjecture. Discrete Comput. Geom., 25(1):1-22, 2001).</description>

      <title>A fast approximate scenario addition method for two-stage robust mixed-integer programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new scenario addition method for two-stage robust mixed-integer programs with finite uncertainty sets. Our method combines and extends speed-up techniques used in previous scenario addition methods (also called column-and-constraint generation methods) and introduces several new techniques. In particular, it uses dual bounds for second-stage problems in order to allow a faster identification of the next promising scenario to be added to the master problem. Moreover, adaptive time limits are imposed to avoid getting stuck on particularly hard second-stage problems, and a gap propagation between master problem and second-stage problems is used to stop solving them earlier if only a given non-zero optimality gap is to be reached overall. This makes our method particularly effective for problems where solving the second-stage problem is computationally challenging. To evaluate the method's performance, we compare it to two recent scenario addition methods from the literature on two applications: a robust capacitated location routing problem and a robust integrated berth allocation and quay crane assignment and scheduling problem. The first problem features a particularly hard second stage, and we show that our method is able to solve considerably more and larger instances in a given time limit. Using the second problem, we verify the general applicability of our method, even for problems where the second stage is relatively easy.</description>

      <title>Learning Robot Safety from Sparse Human Feedback using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring robot safety can be challenging; user-defined constraints can miss edge cases, policies can become unsafe even when trained from safe data, and safety can be subjective. Thus, we learn about robot safety by showing policy trajectories to a human who flags unsafe behavior. From this binary feedback, we use the statistical method of conformal prediction to identify a region of states, potentially in learned latent space, guaranteed to contain a user-specified fraction of future policy errors. Our method is sample-efficient, as it builds on nearest neighbor classification and avoids withholding data as is common with conformal prediction. By alerting if the robot reaches the suspected unsafe region, we obtain a warning system that mimics the human's safety preferences with guaranteed miss rate. From video labeling, our system can detect when a quadcopter visuomotor policy will fail to steer through a designated gate. We present an approach for policy improvement by avoiding the suspected unsafe region. With it we improve a model predictive controller's safety, as shown in experimental testing with 30 quadcopter flights across 6 navigation tasks. Code and videos are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are a rich area of research on the intersection of quantum mechanics and stochastic analysis. We unify multiple views of controlled open quantum systems within the framework of bilinear dynamical systems. We define the corresponding notions of identifiability from the results of quantum state tomography, obtained in many copies of the initial quantum state, under subsequences of varying lengths of control signals. We explain and extend work on identifiability of bilinear systems using either spectral criteria, criteria based on Hankel matrix, and frequency-domain criteria, to the parameter estimation of master equations of open quantum systems. This sets the groundwork for a number of constructive approaches to the identification of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring near-optimal energy systems with stakeholders: a novel approach for participatory modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Involving people in energy systems planning can increase the legitimacy and socio-political feasibility of energy transitions. Participatory research in energy modelling offers the opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a comprehensive way, but is limited by how results can be generated and presented without imposing assumptions and discrete scenarios on the participants. To this end, we present a methodology and a framework, based on near-optimal modelling results, that can incorporate stakeholders in a holistic and engaging way. We confront stakeholders with a continuum of modelling-based energy system designs via an interactive interface allowing them to choose essentially any combination of components that meet the system requirements. Together with information on the implications of different technologies, it is possible to assess how participants prioritise different aspects in energy systems planning while also facilitating learning in an engaging and stimulating way. We showcase the methodology for the remote Arctic settlement of Longyearbyen and illustrate how participants deviate consistently from the cost optimum. At the same time, they manage to balance different priorities such as emissions, costs, and system vulnerability leading to a better understanding of the complexity and intertwined nature of decisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate some isoperimetric-type inequalities related to the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem. First, we establish an analogue of the renowned Faber-Krahn inequality for the fractional composite membrane problem. Next, we investigate an isoperimetric inequality for the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem on the intersection of two domains-a problem that was first studied by Lieb [23] for the Laplacian. Similar results in the local case were previously obtained by Cupini-Vecchi [9] for the composite membrane problem. Our findings provide further insights into the fractional setting, offering a new perspective on these classical inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.07356v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The National Statistics Bureau of Ecuador carries out monthly polls to monitor the evolution of the Consumer Price Index, a metric measuring consumer prices of essential commodities. These surveys are administered across a designated set of stores, with a fleet of vehicles transporting pollsters from the bureau headquarters to the chosen locations. Moreover, pollsters move between stores using pedestrian paths or using a vehicle to shorten the travel time. This paper introduces the Integrated Vehicle and Pollster Routing Problem and presents an integer programming model to effectively schedule pollster visits to selected stores while optimizing the routing of the vehicle fleet. Results on the computational complexity, a three-phase algorithm, and computational experience based on real-world instances are provided.</description>

      <title>Formalising the intentional stance 1: attributing goals and beliefs to stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a formalism inspired by Dennett's notion of the intentional stance. Whereas Dennett's treatment of these concepts is informal, we aim to provide a more formal analogue. We introduce a framework based on stochastic processes with inputs and outputs, in which we can talk precisely about *interpreting* systems as having *normative-epistemic states*, which combine belief-like and desire-like features. Our framework is based on optimality but nevertheless allows us to model some forms of bounded cognition.
  One might expect that the systems that can be described in normative-epistemic terms would be some special subset of all systems, but we show that this is not the case: every system admits a (possibly trivial) normative-epistemic interpretation, and those that can be *uniquely specified* by a normative-epistemic description are exactly the deterministic ones. Finally, we show that there is a suitable notion of Bayesian updating for normative-epistemic states, which we call *value-laden filtering*, since it involves both normative and epistemic elements. For unbounded cognition it is always permissible to attribute beliefs that update in this way. This is not always the case for bounded cognition, but we give a sufficient condition under which it is.
  This paper gives an overview of our framework aimed at cognitive scientists, with a formal mathematical treatment given in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>New Lagrangian dual algorithms for solving the continuous nonlinear resource allocation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous nonlinear resource allocation problem (CONRAP) has broad applications in economics, engineering, production and inventory management, and often serves as a subproblem in complex programming. Without relying on monotonicity assumptions for the objective and constraint functions, we propose two Lagrangian dual algorithms for solving two types of CONRAP. Both algorithms determine an update strategy for the Lagrange multiplier, utilizing the values of the objective and constraint functions at the current and previous iterations. This strategy accelerates the process of finding dual optimal solutions. Subsequently, leveraging the problem's convexity, the primal optimal solution is either directly identified or derived by solving a one-dimensional linear equation. We also prove that both algorithms converge to optimal solutions within a finite number of iterations. Numerical experiments on six types of practical test problems illustrate the superior computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms. For test problems with a general inequality constraint, the first algorithm achieves a CPU time reduction exceeding an order of magnitude compared to solvers such as Gurobi and CVX. For test problems with a linear equality constraint, the second algorithm consistently outperforms four existing algorithms, delivering an improvement of over two orders of magnitude in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A matheuristic approach for an integrated lot-sizing and scheduling problem with a period-based learning effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research investigates a multi-product capacitated lot-sizing and scheduling problem incorporating a novel learning effect, namely the period-based learning effect. This is inspired by a real case in a core analysis laboratory under a job shop setting. Accordingly, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is extended based on the big-bucket formulation, optimizing the total tardiness and overtime costs. Given the complexity of the problem, a cutting plane method is employed to simplify the model. Afterward, three matheuristic methods based on the rolling horizon approach are devised, incorporating two lower bounds and a local search heuristic. Furthermore, a post-processing approach is implemented to incorporate lot-streaming possibility. Computational experiments demonstrate: 1) the simplified model performs effectively in terms of both solution quality and computational time; and 2) although the model encounters challenges with large-scale instances, the proposed matheuristic methods achieve satisfactory outcomes; and 3) it can be inferred that the complexity of the models and solution methods are independent of the learning effect; however, the value of learning effect may impact the performance of the lower bounds; 4) in manufacturing settings, where the lot-streaming is possible, incorporating post-processing can drastically improve the objective function; 5) the impact of the period-based learning effect in the results is significant, and the model's sensitivity to time-based parameters (e.g., learning rate) is more than cost-based ones (e.g., tardiness cost).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the optimal strong error estimates for stochastic parabolic optimal control problem with additive noise and integral state constraint are derived based on time-implicit and finite element discretization. The continuous and discrete first-order optimality conditions are deduced by constructing the Lagrange functional, which contains forward-backward stochastic parabolic equations and a variational equation. The fully discrete version of forward-backward stochastic parabolic equations is introduced as an auxiliary problem and the optimal strong convergence orders are estimated, which further allows the optimal a priori error estimates for control, state, adjoint state and multiplier to be derived. Then, a simple and yet efficient gradient projection algorithm is proposed to solve stochastic parabolic control problem and its convergence rate is proved. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: We study the linear Zakharov--Kuznetsov equation with periodic boundary conditions. Employing some tools from the nonharmonic Fourier series we obtain several internal observability theorems. Then we prove various exact controllability and rapid uniform stabilization results by applying a duality principle and a general feedback construction. The method presented here introduces a new insight into the control of dispersive equations in two-dimensional cases and may be adapted to more general equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a parabolic-elliptic type of Keller-Segel equations with generalized diffusion and logistic source under homogeneous Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions. We construct bounded weak solutions globally in time in an unbalanced optimal transport framework, provided that the magnitude of the chemotactic sensitivity can be restricted depending on parameters. In the case of subquadratic degradation of the logistic source, we quantify the chemotactic sensitivity, in particular, in terms of the power of degradation and the pointwise bound of the initial density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical ventilation is a critical life support intervention that delivers controlled air and oxygen to a patient's lungs, assisting or replacing spontaneous breathing. While several data-driven approaches have been proposed to optimize ventilator control strategies, they often lack interpretability and alignment with domain knowledge, hindering clinical adoption. This paper presents a methodology for interpretable reinforcement learning (RL) aimed at improving mechanical ventilation control as part of connected health systems. Using a causal, nonparametric model-based off-policy evaluation, we assess RL policies for their ability to enhance patient-specific outcomes-specifically, increasing blood oxygen levels (SpO2), while avoiding aggressive ventilator settings that may cause ventilator-induced lung injuries and other complications. Through numerical experiments on real-world ICU data from the MIMIC-III database, we demonstrate that our interpretable decision tree policy achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep RL methods while outperforming standard behavior cloning approaches. The results highlight the potential of interpretable, data-driven decision support systems to improve safety and efficiency in personalized ventilation strategies, paving the way for seamless integration into connected healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric states to realize specified changes in subsequent weather. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Then a convex optimization problem is formulated to achieve various control specifications involving not only quadratic functions but also absolute values and maximum values of the controlled variables and initial atmospheric variables in the cost function and constraints. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using the NWP model. The experiments showed that the identified perturbations successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation.</description>

      <title>Using Linearized Optimal Transport to Predict the Evolution of Stochastic Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm to approximate the time evolution of a probability distribution without explicitly learning an operator that governs the evolution. A particular application of interest is discrete measures $\mu_t^N$ that arise from systems of $N$ particles in $\mathbb R^d$. In many such situations, the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales, making it difficult to learn the dynamics of a governing operator, but the bulk distribution $\mu_t^N$ approximates an absolutely continuous measure $\mu_t$ that evolves ``smoothly.'' If $\mu_t$ is known on some time interval, then linearized optimal transport theory provides an Euler-like scheme for approximating the evolution of $\mu_t$ using its ``tangent vector field'' (represented as a time-dependent vector field on $\mathbb R^d$), which can be computed as a limit of optimal transport maps. We propose an analog of this Euler approximation to predict the evolution of the discrete measure $\mu_t^N$ (without knowing $\mu_t$). To approximate the analogous tangent vector field, we use a finite difference over a time step that sits between two time scales of the system -- long enough for a large-$N$ evolution ($\mu_t$) to emerge but short enough to satisfactorily approximate the derivative object used in the Euler scheme. The emergence of the limiting behavior ensures the optimal transport maps closely approximate the vector field describing the bulk distribution's smooth evolution instead of the individual particles' more chaotic movements. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with two illustrative examples, Gaussian diffusion and a cell chemotaxis model, and show that our method succeeds in predicting the bulk behavior over relatively large steps.</description>

      <title>Equity Impacts of Public Transit Network Redesign with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs (equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas (equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget. Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is explicitly incorporated into the design objective.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum State Reconstruction with Structured Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the required number of total state copies and classical computational resources. Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to $O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r&lt;2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of $O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCS method.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Spacecraft Servicing under Partial Feedback using Lyapunov-based Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly applied in space missions, including distributed space systems, resilient constellations, and autonomous rendezvous and docking operations. A critical emerging application is collaborative spacecraft servicing, which encompasses on-orbit maintenance, space debris removal, and swarm-based satellite repositioning. These missions involve servicing spacecraft interacting with malfunctioning or defunct spacecraft under challenging conditions, such as limited state information, measurement inaccuracies, and erratic target behaviors. Existing approaches often rely on assumptions of full state knowledge or single-integrator dynamics, which are impractical for real-world applications involving second-order spacecraft dynamics. This work addresses these challenges by developing a distributed state estimation and tracking framework that requires only relative position measurements and operates under partial state information. A novel $\rho$-filter is introduced to reconstruct unknown states using locally available information, and a Lyapunov-based deep neural network adaptive controller is developed that adaptively compensates for uncertainties stemming from unknown spacecraft dynamics. To ensure the collaborative spacecraft regulation problem is well-posed, a trackability condition is defined. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to ensure exponential convergence of errors in state estimation and spacecraft regulation to a neighborhood of the origin under the trackability condition. The developed method eliminates the need for expensive velocity sensors or extensive pre-training, offering a practical and robust solution for spacecraft servicing in complex, dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis: a control perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1) prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2) that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost) over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori assuming that all time varying parameters are bounded, which for many optimization tasks is not unrealistic, but is a non starter in control applications. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control and ask the following question "Are regret optimal control strategies deployable?"</description>
