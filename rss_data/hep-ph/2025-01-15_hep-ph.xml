      <title>Probing Supernova Neutrino Boosted Dark Matter with Collective Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the supernova neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$BDM) and its direct detection. During core-collapse supernovae, an abundance of neutrinos are emitted. These supernova neutrinos can transfer their kinetic energy to the light dark matter via their interactions, and thus are detected in the neutrino and dark matter experiments. Due to the exponential suppression of the high-energy neutrino flux, the kinetic energy carried by a large portion of SN$\nu$BDM falls within the MeV range. This could potentially produce the collective excitation signals in the semiconductor detectors with the skipper-CCD. We calculate the plasmon excitation rate induced by SN$\nu$BDM and derive the exclusion limits. In contrast with conventional neutrino and dark matter direct detection experiments, our results present a significant enhancement in sensitivity for the sub-MeV dark matter.</description>

      <title>Relativistic correction to the magnetic moment of the charged lepton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general Hamiltonian expression up to the first-order relativistic correction was derived by breaking the four-component Dirac equation into the two-component Dirac-Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian incorporates the first-order relativistic correction to the electromagnetic interaction with the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the charged lepton, which distinguishes it differently from other generic Hamiltonians. The first-order relativistic adjustment to the Land\'e g factor, or equivalently to the magnetic moment, was calculated using this generalized Hamiltonian for hydrogen-like atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. It turns out that when we impose specific states, the formulations produced in the literature match this relativistic correction. Furthermore, we have shown that the relativistic effect-induced energy shift of order $\alpha^2$ is dependent on the square of azimuthal quantum number $m_j^2$, as well as on both principal and total quantum numbers denoted, respectively, by $n$ and $j$, which is different from the case of absence of an external magnetic field where the energy shift depends only on $n$.</description>

      <title>Future collider sensitivities to $\nu$SMEFT interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of neutrino oscillations and masses provides strong motivation to extend the Standard Model by including right-handed neutrinos, which lead to heavy neutrino states that could exist at the electroweak scale. These states may also be influenced by new high-scale, weakly interacting physics. Incorporating right-handed neutrinos into an effective field theory framework -- the $\nu$SMEFT -- offers a systematic approach to study the phenomenology of heavy neutrinos in current and upcoming experiments. In this work, we present the first prospective 95\% exclusion plots achievable at a future lepton collider operating at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=0.5 ~\rm{TeV}$ for what we term the agnostic $\nu$SMEFT scenario. This study focuses on the high-mass regime where the heavy neutrino $N$ decays promptly into leptons and jets. Specifically, we analyze the processes $e^+e^- \to \nu N \to \nu \mu^{-} \mu^{+} \nu$ and $e^+e^- \to \nu N \to \nu \mu^{-} \mathrm{j} \mathrm{j}$, deriving the exclusion regions in the $\frac{\alpha}{\Lambda^2}$ vs. $m_N$ parameter space. When compared to prospective limits for the LHeC, we find that the semi-leptonic process with final jets in a lepton collider offers the greatest sensitivity, even with a straightforward cut-based analysis. The expected bounds are as stringent as those considered in recent studies for the low-mass regime where the $N$ may be long-lived and detectable via displaced decay searches, both at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Exploring constraints on the core radius and density jumps inside Earth using atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutrinos, through their weak interactions, can serve as an independent tool for exploring the internal structure of Earth. The information obtained would be complementary to that provided by seismic and gravitational measurements. The Earth matter effects in neutrino oscillations depend upon the energy of neutrinos and the electron density distribution that they encounter during their journey through Earth, and hence, can be used to probe the inner structure of Earth. In this contribution, we demonstrate how well an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as an iron calorimeter detector (ICAL), would simultaneously constrain the density jumps inside Earth and determine the location of the core-mantle boundary. In this work, we employ a five-layered density model of Earth, where the layer densities and core radius are modified to explore the parameter space, ensuring that the mass and moment of inertia of Earth remain constant while satisfying the hydrostatic equilibrium condition. We further demonstrate that the charge identification capability of an ICAL-like detector would play a crucial role in obtaining these correlated constraints.</description>

      <title>Widen the Resonance: Probing a New Regime of Neutrino Self-Interactions with Astrophysical Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass much smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Probing New Physics with the Electron Yukawa coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dedicated run of a future electron-positron collider (FCC-ee) at a center-of-mass energy equal to the Higgs boson mass would enable a direct measurement of the electron Yukawa coupling. However, it poses substantial experimental difficulties due to large backgrounds, the requirement for monochromatised $e^+e^-$ beams, and the potential extension of the FCC-ee timeline. Given this, we explore the extent to which the electron Yukawa coupling can be enhanced in simplified UV models and examine whether such scenarios can be constrained by other FCC-ee runs or upcoming experiments at the intensity frontier. Our results indicate that in certain classes of models, the $(g-2)_e$ provides a probe of the electron Yukawa coupling that is as effective or better than the FCC-ee. Nevertheless, there exist models that can lead to sizeable deviations in the electron Yukawa coupling which can only be probed in a dedicated run at the Higgs pole mass.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass from wash-in leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptogenesis is an attractive scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe that relies on the dynamics of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) in the seesaw extension of the Standard Model. In standard thermal leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale $M_N$ is subject to the Davidson--Ibarra bound, $M_N \gtrsim 10^9\,\textrm{GeV}$, which builds on the assumption that RHN decays are responsible for the violation of both charge-parity invariance ($CP$) and baryon-minus-lepton number ($B\!-\!L$). In this paper, we relax this assumption in the context of the more general framework of wash-in leptogenesis, in which $CP$ violation is encoded in the initial conditions and the only remaining task of the RHN decays is to violate $B\!-\!L$. Solving the relevant set of Boltzmann equations, we find that, in wash-in leptogenesis, the RHN mass scale can be as low as 7 TeV.</description>

      <title>A Step Toward Interpretability: Smearing the Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of interpretability of machine learning architecture in particle physics has no agreed-upon definition, much less any proposed solution. We present a first modest step toward these goals by proposing a definition and corresponding practical method for isolation and identification of relevant physical energy scales exploited by the machine. This is accomplished by smearing or averaging over all input events that lie within a prescribed metric energy distance of one another and correspondingly renders any quantity measured on a finite, discrete dataset continuous over the dataspace. Within this approach, we are able to explicitly demonstrate that (approximate) scaling laws are a consequence of extreme value theory applied to analysis of the distribution of the irreducible minimal distance over which a machine must extrapolate given a finite dataset. As an example, we study quark versus gluon jet identification, construct the smeared likelihood, and show that discrimination power steadily increases as resolution decreases, indicating that the true likelihood for the problem is sensitive to emissions at all scales.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavor-dependent quark-antiquark contact interactions recently derived for flavor U(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, due to vacuum polarization, are articulated with the resulting mixing effects in view. The formal effects of the explicit mixing interactions, $G_{i\neq j}$, are detailed firstly for the meson mixing problem without the inclusion of 't Hooft interactions induced by instantons. Secondly, it is shown that these mixings, in the scalar channel of quark-antiquark interactions, might give rise to quark mixing in the gap equations. Sixth order quark-antiquark interactions from vacuum polarization, that break $U_A(1)$ symmetry, also contribute.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) provide a unique environment to study Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs) such as Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and Dark Photons (DPs). This paper focuses on heavy FIPs produced in SNe, whose decay produces electrons and positrons, generating observable secondary signals during their propagation and annihilation. We focus on the In-flight Annihilation (IA) of positrons, which emerge as the most significant contribution to the resulting gamma-ray spectrum. Using data from COMPTEL and EGRET we derive the most stringent bounds on the FIP-electron couplings for heavy ALPs, sterile neutrinos, and DPs. These results strenghten existing bounds of one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the FIP model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of instantons and anti-instantons. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid (IL) ensemble. The IL ensemble prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>

Abstract: We study the scalar potential of a dilaton model with local gauge conformal symmetry D(1) and investigate a couple of scenarios for the symmetry breaking mechanisms. We focus on the couplings of Higgs-weak vector bosons and Higgs self-couplings in this model and examine the LHC constraints on the parameter space. The parameter space where the discovered Higgs boson $m_h=125$ GeV can be dilaton dominant is identified and features of Higgs self-couplings are explored. It is found that via the measurement of Higgs pair production, the High Luminosity LHC running can either confirms or rules out the dilaton dominance.</description>

      <title>Modified Coherence and the Transverse Extent of Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the transverse size of parton showers and their diminishing interaction with the medium in the high virtuality stage of jet evolution. We consider the process of a hard quark produced in deep inelastic scattering off a large nucleus. Single gluon radiation from this quark, in the absence of scattering, is re-derived using wave-packets. This allows for a derivation of the quantum uncertainty size of the hard quark, at the point of splitting. This uncertainty size is then incorporated within a Monte-Carlo shower routine yielding transverse shower sizes noticeably larger than the classical antenna size of the shower. No clear relation is found between the full uncertainty size of the shower and the virtuality of the originating parton. The single gluon emission from the hard quark is then re-analysed for the case of single rescattering off the remainder of the nucleus. A relation is derived between the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ and the gluon Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Function (gTMDPDF). Solving this relation, for a simple case, clearly demonstrates the weakening of $\hat{q}$ with the virtuality of the hard splitting parton.</description>

      <title>Covariant analysis of electromagnetic current on the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of the Lorentz covariance of the charge form factor for a strongly coupled scalar theory in (3+1)-dimensions. Our results are based on the non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa theory with a Fock sector expansion including up to thee-particles (one mock nucleon plus two mock pions or two mock nucleons plus one mock anti-nucleon). The light-front Hamiltonian is constructed and renormalized using a Fock sector dependent scheme. The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.
  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\zeta, \Delta^2_\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory.</description>

Abstract: The search for axions sits at the intersection of solving critical problems in fundamental physics, including the strong CP problem in QCD, uncovering the nature of dark matter, and understanding the origin of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. The measurement of axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions offers a powerful approach for axion detection. However, it has long been restricted to regions outside the 'axion window' due to a significant trade-off: the need to effectively suppress the magnetic leakage from highly polarized spin sources while simultaneously detecting sub-femtotesla level exotic physics signals at sub-decimeter-scale distances. In this work, we report new experimental results on axion-mediated exotic spin-spin interactions using an iron-shielded SmCo$_5$ spin source in combination with a specially designed self-compensation comagnetometer. Employing a composite shielding structure, we achieved a suppression of the magnetic field by up to $10^{11}$. This enabled us to establish new constraints on the coupling between electrons and neutrons, surpassing previous experimental limits by more than 10000 times within the axion window. Furthermore, we also set strongest constraints on the coupling between electrons and protons. The proposed method holds substantial potential not only for advancing the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model but also for enabling transformative applications in biological and chemical research.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves dynamics with Higgs portal and U(1) X SU(2) interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a mixture of Higgs boson with a heavy scalar singlet with large vacuum expectation value ( vev) is a viable model of inflation that satisfy the existing observational data, the perturbativity constraints, avoiding in the same time the EW vacuum metastability as long as the Higgs portal interactions lead to positive tree-level threshold corrections for SM Higgs quartic coupling. The tree-level threshold corrections lead to the change of Hubble expansion rate during inflation with impact on the evolution of the axion-gauge field spectator sector, modifying the time-dependent mass parameter of the gauge field fluctuation. We evaluate this effect on the GW sourced tensor modes while accounting for the consistency and backreaction constraints and show that the Higgs portal interactions enhance the GW signal sourced by the gauge field fluctuations in the CMB B-mode ploarization power spectra. We address the detectability of the GW sourced by the gauge field fluctuations in presence of Higgs portal interactions for the experimental configuration of the future CMB polarization LiteBird space mission. We find that the sourced GW tensor-to-scalar ratio in presence of Higgs portal interactions is enhanced to a level that overcomes the vacuum tensor-to-scalar ratio by a factor of 10, much above the detection threshold of the LiteBird experiment, in agreement with the existing observational constraints on the curvature fluctuations and the allowed parameter space of Higgs portal interactions. We also show that a large enhancement of the sourced GW can be also detected by experiments such as pulsar timing arrays and laser/atomic interferometers. Moreover, a significant Higgs-singlet mixing can be probed by the LHC Higgs searchers.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Ultralight Axionlike Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New limits on the axion-nucleon coupling over the axion mass region $10^{-24} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV are derived by reanalyzing data from laboratory measurements on Lorentz and $CPT$ violation. These results establish the first laboratory constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling for axion masses below $10^{-22}$ eV. For $10^{-22} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV, the results improve upon previous laboratory limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude, exceeding for the first time the astrophysical limits from supernova SN1987A cooling. For the axion mass range of interest corresponding to ultralow frequencies, the crucial initial phase of the axion field is considered. Furthermore, the obtained limits are nearly equivalent to those projected for a recently proposed experiment employing high-intensity neutron beams at the European Spallation Source [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 181001 (2024)]. For an alternative type of axion-nucleon interaction, the quadratic wind coupling, the constraints exceed the current best results by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Exclusive leptoproduction of a light vector meson at the twist-3 in a GTMD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the most general description of the exclusive leptoproduction of a light vector meson, at high center-of-mass energy, within the CGC/shockwave formalism. We keep a twist-3 accuracy in $s$ channel, thus being able to describe all possible helicity amplitudes, including the ones for the production of a transversally polarized meson. In this latter case, we overcome the well-known issue of endpoint singularities by promoting the GPD to a GTMD given by matrix elements of dipole and double dipole operators. The all-twists treatment of the proton (nucleon) target allow to safely twist-expand the general vacuum-to-meson matrix elements. Therefore, unlike previous attempts in the modified perturbative approach, our final results are expressed in terms of the twist-3 collinear distribution amplitudes, introduced in the context of the higher-twist collinear formalism.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum radiation with flying-focus laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission of a photon by an electron in an intense laser field is one of the most fundamental processes in electrodynamics and underlies the many applications that utilize high-energy photon beams. This process is typically studied for electrons colliding head-on with a stationary-focus laser pulse. Here, we show that the energy lost by electrons and the yield of emitted photons can be substantially increased by replacing a stationary-focus pulse with an equal-energy flying-focus pulse whose focus co-propagates with the electrons. These advantages of the flying focus are a result of operating in the quantum regime of the interaction, where the energy loss and photon yield scale more favorably with the interaction time than the laser intensity. Simulations of 10 GeV electrons colliding with 10 J pulses demonstrate these advantages and predict a $5\times$ increase in the yield of 1-20 MeV photons with a flying focus pulse, which would impact applications in medicine, material science, and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Kinematic power corrections to DVCS to twist-six accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate $(\sqrt{-t}/Q)^k $ and $(m/Q)^k$ power corrections with $k\le 4$, where $m$ is the target mass and $t$ is the momentum transfer, to several key observables in Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS). We find that the power expansion is well convergent up to $|t|/Q^2\lesssim 1/4$ for most of the observables, but is naturally organized in terms of $1/(Q^2+t)$ rather than the nominal hard scale $1/Q^2$. We also argue that target mass corrections remain under control and do not endanger QCD factorization for coherent DVCS on nuclei. These results remove an important source of uncertainties due to the frame dependence and violation of electromagnetic Ward identities in the QCD predictions for the DVCS amplitudes in the leading-twist approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the sensitivity of the Future Circular $e^+ e^-$ Collider (FCC-ee) to the interactions of new, heavy particles in terms of publicly available extensions to the smelli and flavio computer programs. We parameterize new particles' effects with dimension-6 operators of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) without any flavor assumptions and take into account the projected experimental and theoretical uncertainties of various electroweak and Higgs observables at the proposed collider. We illustrate a use of the calculation by estimating the sensitivity of the FCC-ee to a family non-universal $Z^\prime$ model that explains anomalies inferred from present-day measurements and Standard Model predictions of observables that involve the $ b \rightarrow s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transition.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Light Dark Matter Simulations and Stellar Dynamics: Tension in Dwarf Galaxies for $m &lt; 5\times10^{-21} $ eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of dark matter and stellar dynamics in Ultra Light Dark Matter halos tailored to mimic dwarf galaxies. For dark matter particle mass $m\approx 1\times 10^{-22}$ eV, dynamical heating causes the half-light radius to over-shoot surface brightness data of the Fornax galaxy. For $m\approx 1\times 10^{-21}$ eV, soliton core formation leads to a velocity dispersion peak incompatible with kinematics data. Extending the analysis to the Carina and Leo II galaxies, the tension persists up to $m\approx 5\times 10^{-21}$ eV. A caveat in our analysis is the omission of stellar self-gravity. This would not change dynamics today, but could affect extrapolation back in time if the stellar body was more compact in the past.</description>

      <title>Primordial Non-Gaussianity from Light Compact Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussianities generated by light axions, or compact scalar fields, during inflation. To correctly calculate their impact on primordial statistics, we will argue that it is necessary to account for the periodicity, or gauge symmetry, of the compact scalars. We illustrate this point by comparing the predictions for the squeezed kinematic limit of the primordial bispectrum generated by two cases: a non-compact scalar $\sigma$ and a compact scalar $\varphi$. We demonstrate that while a light non-compact scalar predicts a bispectrum of the so-called local shape, the light compact scalar predicts a qualitatively different shape characterised by the ratio of the Hubble scale to its field-space circumference. In doing so, we show that ignoring the gauge symmetry of the compact scalar during inflation leads to spurious infrared enhancements which are softened by working with appropriate gauge-invariant operators. In addition, we connect our results for the primordial bispectrum with late-time cosmological observables and show that it is possible to measure the decay constant of the compact scalar using galaxy clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the gravitational wave signal from compact binary inspirals allow us to constrain the internal structure of those objects via physical parameters such as the tidal Love numbers. In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity, which further allows us to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Building upon previous results, we present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations of motion. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields. We find that there is a potential ambiguity in extracting the Love numbers in this way, which we resolve by performing supplementary calculations in the effective field theory framework. We show that, in the case of scalar-tensor theories, the tidal Love numbers are not directly given by the $1/r^3$ term in the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields, as there is an additional contribution to this term independent of the Love numbers. We calculate such a contribution for a minimally coupled scalar field and also for the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese model. For the latter, we find that the Love numbers can differ by $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 10)\,\%$, if this additional contribution is not taken into account.</description>

      <title>The topological susceptibility and excess kurtosis in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the topological susceptibility and the excess kurtosis of $SU(3)$ pure gauge theory in four space-time dimensions. The result is based on high-statistics studies at seven lattice spacings and in seven physical volumes, allowing for a controlled continuum and infinite volume extrapolation. We use a gluonic topological charge measurement, with gradient flow smoothing in the operator. Two complementary smoothing strategies are used (one keeps the flow time fixed in lattice units, one in physical units). Our data support a recent claim that both strategies yield a universal continuum limit; we find $\chi_\mathrm{top}^{1/4}r_0=0.4769(14)(11)$ or $\chi_\mathrm{top}^{1/4}=197.8(0.7)(2.7)\,\mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Birefringence in fermion-attenuated gravitational wave power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of Chern-Simons gravity, a theory that dynamically violates parity, we analyze the power spectrum of gravitational waves in light of the damping effect due to the free streaming relativistic neutrinos and dark fermions. The power spectrum is expressed terms of right- and left-handed polarizations, and the evolution of the gravitational waves is studied numerically. Birefringence is explicitly shown in the power spectrum, though the difference in the amplitudes is small. Specific features of peaks and dips appear gravitational wave power spectrum mirroring chiral gravitational wave mediated parametric resonance during reheating. Our result represents a useful tool to test Chern-Simons gravity and enables to constrain mechanisms of inflation and reheating related to this theory. We predict a falsifiable pattern of observable peaks and dips in the chiral independent gravitational power spectrum, eventually observable in next space-borne gravitational interferometers, including LISA, Taiji and Tianqin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two medium-baseline, kiloton-scale neutrino experiments to study neutrinos from LHC proton-proton collisions: SINE, a surface-based scintillator panel detector observing muon neutrinos from the CMS interaction point, and UNDINE, a water Cherenkov detector submerged in lake Geneva observing all-flavor neutrinos from LHCb. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate millions of neutrino interactions during the high-luminosity LHC era. We show that these datasets can constrain neutrino cross sections, charm production in $pp$ collisions, and strangeness enhancement as a solution to the cosmic-ray muon puzzle. SINE and UNDINE thus offer a cost-effective medium-baseline complement to the proposed short-baseline forward physics facility.</description>

      <title>Two- versus three-body approach to femtoscopic hadron-deuteron correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-body approach to hadron-deuteron correlations is shown to turn into a two-body approach if the three-particle hadron-deuteron wave function factorizes into the deuteron wave-function and the wave function of a hadron motion relative to the deuteron. Then, the hadron-deuteron correlation function is as in the two-body approach only the source radius somewhat changes. For this reason, as we argue, the two-body approach works well for kaon-deuteron correlations but it fails for proton-deuteron ones in case of small sources. Applying the three-body approach generalized to the case where the radius of the hadron source is different from the nucleon source radius, we derive the source radius formula which used in the two-body approach gives the correlation function as in the `factorized' three-body one. The formula is discussed in the context of existing and future experimental data.</description>

      <title>Definition and evolution of transverse momentum dependent distribution of twist-three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions of twist-three. In particular, we focus on evolution equations, symmetry relations, parameterization, interpretation, small-b asymptotic behaviour and the structure of singularities. The starting point of discussion are the correlators with the definite TMD-twist. By considering suitable combinations of these correlators, we introduce physical TMD distribution of twist-three that can be used for practical applications. We also establish relations with generic TMD distribution of twist-three, and demonstrate that their evolution equations are autonomous in the large-$N_c$ limit.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum dependent factorization for SIDIS at next-to-leading power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) is the golden process for investigating the nucleon's transverse momentum-dependent (TMD) structure. We present the complete expression for SIDIS structure functions in the TMD factorization formalism at the next-to-leading power. All perturbative elements of the factorization theorem -- coefficient functions and evolution kernels -- are presented at one-loop accuracy. We found several differences with earlier derivations, which are due to accounting for nontrivial kinematics of the quark-gluon interference terms. As a side result, we present the definition and evolution of twist-three TMD fragmentation functions, including the leading-order evolution kernel.</description>

      <title>Is there a (Pseudo)Scalar at 95 GeV?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of interpreting the recent experimental hints, in favour of a 95 GeV resonance, with extensions of the Standard Model featuring an extra Higgs doublet and SM scalar (2HDM+s) or pseudoscalar singlet (2HDM+a). The possibility of reproducing the experimental anomalies will be compared with the theoretical constraints on the extended Higgs sector as well as complementary bounds coming from flavour physics as well as other colliders searchers. For both the 2HDM+s and 2HDM+a we will consider a generic natural flavour conserving (NFC) as well as the customary Type-I, -II, -X and -Y configurations of the Yukawa coupling to the BSM Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>A Scotogenic Model as a Prototype for Leptogenesis with One Single Gauge Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of a minimal Scotogenic model with two additional scalar doublets and a single heavy Majorana fermion to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets. Despite stringent limits from the dark matter abundance, direct detection experiments, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we find a parametric region consistent with all bounds which could resolve the above shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. Methodically, we improve on the calculation of correlations between the mixing scalar fields given their finite width. We also present an argument to justify the kinetic equilibrium approximation for out-of-equilibrium distribution functions often used in calculations of Baryogenesis and Leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Strangeness $+1$ light multiquark baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view of the renewing experimental interest for searching strangeness $+1$ baryons at J-PARC, we study the existence of light baryon resonances with strangeness +1 generated in the $K$-$(N^*/\Delta^*)$ system, where $N^*$ represents either $N^*(1535)$/$N^*(1650)$/$N^*(1700)$, and $\Delta^*$ corresponds to $\Delta(1620)$. The description of the properties of the aforementioned states requires considering the dynamics involved in the coupled pseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon systems with strangeness $S=0$ in the s-wave. For the purpose of our current study, we consider the pseudoscalar-baryon (PB) and vector-baryon channels (VB) to which the mentioned $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances couple and solve the Faddeev equations for the coupled channel system $K$-$\text{PB}$, $K$-$\text{VB}$, with all interactions being in the s-wave. Despite some strong attraction present in two of the subsystems, we do not find clear evidence supporting the formation of strangeness +1 states, with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$, in the energy region $2000-2200$ MeV. However, the case of spin-parity $J^P=3/2^+$ seems more promising, showing the formation of a resonance with a mass around 2167 MeV, with a width of 90-100 MeV. We suggest that a signal of such a state could be found in processes with final states like $KN$, $K^*(892) N$.</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forty years ago Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe. We discuss the impact of an instability in the hadronic phase separating a low density, positive-strange-charge phase from a high-density phase with a negative strange charge. This second phase can rapidly stabilize by forming color-superconducting gaps. The strangelets then undergo partial evaporation. In this way, we obtain distributions of their sizes in agreement with the observational constraints and we discuss the many astrophysical and cosmological implications of these objects. Finally, we examine the most promising techniques to detect this type of strangelets. We also show that strangelets can exist with masses $\lesssim10^{17} \mathrm g$, while primordial black holes are ruled out in that mass range, allowing us to distinguish between these two dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Neutrino many-body flavor evolution: the full Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study neutrino flavor evolution in the quantum many-body approach using the full neutrino-neutrino Hamiltonian, including the usually neglected terms that mediate non-forward scattering processes. Working in the occupation number representation with plane waves as single-particle states, we explore the time evolution of simple initial states with up to $N=10$ neutrinos. We discuss the time evolution of the Loschmidt echo, one body flavor and kinetic observables, and the one-body entanglement entropy. For the small systems considered, we observe `thermalization' of both flavor and momentum degrees of freedom on comparable time scales, with results converging towards expectation values computed within a microcanonical ensemble. We also observe that the inclusion of non-forward processes generates a faster flavor evolution compared to the one induced by the truncated (forward) Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a hadronic de-excitation mechanism via lepton flavor violation (LFV). Namely, for vector and pseudoscalar meson decays of the form $V^\prime \to V \mu e$ and $P^\prime \to P \mu e$, respectively. They are described considering effective dim-5 and dim-7 operators. Using the current bounds for the effective couplings obtained from direct processes, we exhibit the different features in the dilepton invariant mass distribution and the branching ratios, depending on the effective operator. We consider hadronic states, from light mesons to quarkonia. We show that the branching ratios of quarkonia system for LFV are comparable with the estimates in other hadronic systems. Our results show that the dilepton invariant mass may be useful to constrain individual contributions and help disentangle them, when complemented with observables from nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the non-unitary effects in the linear seesaw mechanism using the current constraints and future sensitivity of the charged Lepton Flavor Violation (cLFV) processes. We perform a random scan confronting the non-unitary parameters with the limits to the cLFV processes. We show our results for the normal and inverted ordering of the oscillation data. We also discuss the equivalence of different parametrizations of the non-unitary mixing matrix and show our results in terms of the different parameterizations. We found that the stronger restrictions in the non-unitary parameter space come from rare muon decay searches.</description>

Abstract: We study vacua of moduli potential consisting of multiple contribution of modular forms in a finite modular symmetry. If the potential is given by a single modular form, the Minkowski vacuum is realized at the fixed point of the modular symmetry. We show that the de Sitter vacuum is realized with a multiple modular form case and obtain a non-trivial vacuum which is away from the fixed point, i.e. a large modulus vacuum expectation value, depending on the choice of the weight and representation of the modular forms. We study these vacua numerically and analytically. It is also found that the vacua obtained in this paper preserve CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Low-mass constraints on WIMP effective models of inelastic scattering using the Migdal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Migdal effect to extend to low masses the bounds on each of the effective couplings of the non-relativistic effective field theory of a WIMP of mass $m_\chi$ and spin 1/2 that interacts inelastically with nuclei by either upscattering to a heavier state with mass splitting $\delta&gt;0$ or by downscattering to a lighter state with $\delta&lt;0$. In order to do so we perform a systematic analysis of the Migdal bounds in the $m_\chi-\delta$ parameter space comparing them to those from nuclear recoil searches. The Migdal effect allows to significantly extend to low WIMP masses the nuclear recoil bounds for $\delta&lt;0$. In this case the bounds are driven by XENON1T, except when $\delta$ is vanishing or very small, when, depending on the WIMP-nucleus interaction, in the lower end of the $m_\chi$ range either DS50 or SuperCDMS are more constraining. On the other hand, when $\delta&gt;0$ and the WIMP particle upscatters to a heavier state nuclear recoil bounds are stronger than those from the Migdal effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous non-standard interactions between neutrinos and scalar fields have been suggested in the literature. In this work, we have outlined the case of tensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be related to the effective CPT-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME). Moreover, in this paper, we have mostly analyzed the projected sensitivities to the CPT-even isotropic $c_{\alpha \beta}$ and $Z-$spatial $c_{\alpha \beta}^{ZZ}$ SME coefficients, in the context of a long-baseline experimental configuration. We study the particular case of DUNE and show its sensitivity to this type of new physics. The current IceCube experiment and upcoming neutrino experiments such as KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals may clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of WIMP bounds on the velocity distribution in the limit of a massless mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the sensitivity of the bounds on the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron interaction couplings $\alpha_{SI, SD}^{p,n}$ on the WIMP velocity distribution for a massless mediator in the propagator by combining direct detection and the neutrino signal from WIMP annihilation in the Sun (fixing the annihilation channel to $b\bar{b}$). We update the bounds in the Standard Halo Model (SHM) and using the halo-independent single-stream method. In the case of a massless mediator the SHM capture rate in the Sun diverges and is regularized by removing the contribution of WIMPs locked into orbits that extend beyond the Sun-Jupiter distance. We discuss the dependence of the SHM bounds on the Jupiter cut showing that it can be sizeable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and a WIMP mass $m_\chi$ exceeding 1 TeV. Our updated SHM bounds show an improvement between about two and three orders of magnitude compared to the previous ones in the literature. Our halo-independent analysis shows that, with the exception of $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ at large $m_\chi$, the relaxation of the bounds compared to the SHM is of the same order of that for contact interactions, i.e. relatively moderate in the low and high WIMP mass regimes and as large as a few $\times\sim 10^2$ for $m_\chi\simeq$ 20 GeV. On the other hand, the exact determination of the relaxation of the bound becomes not reliable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and $m_\chi\gtrsim$ 1 TeV due to the sensitivity of the SHM capture rate in the Sun to the details of the Maxwellian velocity distribution at low incoming WIMP speeds. The halo-independent bounds do not depend on the Jupiter cut needed to regularize the calculation of the capture rate.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we calculate the CP-averaged branching ratios and the direct CP-violating asymmetries of the three body decays B^{0}\rightarrow T(\pi\pi, K\bar{K},\pi\eta) in the perturbative QCD approach, where T denotes tensor mesons a_{2}(1320), K^{*}_{2}(1430), f_{2}(1270) and f^{'}_{2}(1525), and the daughter branching is f_{0}(980)\rightarrow \pi\pi, K\bar{K},f_{0}(500)\rightarrow \pi\pi, a_{0}(980)\rightarrow K\bar{K}, \pi\eta. We found the following (a) With \theta=135^{\circ}, we evaluate the branching fractions of B^{0} \rightarrow K^{*}_{2}(1430)f_{0}(980)[ \rightarrow \pi^ {+}\pi^{-}] to be 4.30\times10^{-6},then under the narrow-width approximation we extract the branching fraction of the decay B^{0} \rightarrow K^{*}_{2}(1430)f_{0}(980) to be 8.78\times10^{-6},which is consistent with the current experimental data well. (b) The decay rates for the considered decay modes are generally in the order of 10^{-8} to 10^{-5}. (c) The branching fractions are sensitive to the \theta, and the opposite is true for \phi. The \phi is really small, so the decay branching ratio has only little change, except for some decays involving f^{'}_{2}(1525). (d) The \theta and \phi can bring remarkable change to the direct CP asymmetries of pure penguin processes so that it is not 0. (e) We calculate the relative partial decay widths {\Gamma}(a_{0} \rightarrow K\overline{K})/{\Gamma}(a_{0} \rightarrow \pi\eta) and the ratio {\cal B}(f_{0} \rightarrow K^{+}K^{-})/{\cal B}(f_{0} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}), which are in agreement with the existing experimental values. Our results can help one to understand the internal structure of scalar mesons and the nature of tensor mesons and can be tested by future experiments.</description>

Abstract: When the quark masses are lighter than those in QCD, the standard lore is that a chiral transition of first order must emerge for three, light flavors. Recently, however, numerical simulations on the lattice suggest that the chiral transition is of second order in the chiral limit. Using an extended linear sigma model in the mean field approximation, we study the relation between terms which break the anomalous, $U(1)_A$ symmetry and the order of the chiral phase transition, especially how a chiral transition of second order can arise for three, massless flavors. We note that in an (unphysical) region of the "Columbia" phase diagram, when the strange quark mass is light and negative, corresponding to topological angle $\theta=\pi$, the $CP$ symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multi-jet merging for deep inelastic scattering in the Vincia parton shower in the Monte Carlo event generator Pythia 8. Merging combines event samples of different parton multiplicities with logarithmically enhanced parton-shower radiation. We consider up to five outgoing partons using two different merging algorithms. We vary the relevant scale choices and compare to experimental data by H1 collaboration at the HERA collider. Results show that multi-jet merging improves description to data, especially for low virtuality events, and that jet cross-sections converge when the partonic multiplicity exceeds the number of reconstructed jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical pseudo-gauge transformations are discussed in the context of hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions. A decomposition of the pseudo-gauge transformation into Lorentz-invariant tensors is made, which allows for better interpretation of its physical consequences. For pseudo-gauge transformations connecting two symmetric energy-momentum tensors, we find that the super-potential $\Phi^{\lambda \mu \nu}$ must obey a conservation law of the form $\partial_\lambda \Phi^{\lambda \mu \nu} = 0$. This equation, referred to below as the STS condition, represents a constraint that is hardly possible to be satisfied for tensors constructed out of the basic hydrodynamic variables such as temperature, baryon chemical potential, and the hydrodynamic flow. However, in a special case of the boost-invariant flow, the STS condition is automatically fulfilled and a non-trivial residual pseudo-gauge transformation defined by a single scalar field is allowed. In this case the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients become pseudo-gauge dependent; however, their specific linear combination appearing in the equations of motion remains pseudo-gauge invariant. This finding provides new insights into the role of pseudo-gauge transformations and pseudo-gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter has been theorized to be charged under its own "dark electromagnetism" (dark-EM). Under this hypothesis, dark matter can behave like a cold collisionless plasma of self-interacting dark matter particles, and exhibit plasma-like instabilities with observational consequences. Using the results published in [1], which studied the degree of slowdown between two interpenetrating $e^-\,e^+$ plasma clouds due to plasma instabilities, estimates of similar interactions for colliding "dark plasmas" are explored. Comparison with astronomical observations reveals strong new constraints on dark-EM with the dark electromagnetic self-interaction $\alpha_{D} &lt; 4 \times 10^{-25}$.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the three-loop five-point pentagon-box-box massless integral family in the dimensional regularization scheme, via canonical differential equation. We use tools from computational algebraic geometry to enable the necessary integral reductions. The boundary values of the differential equation are determined analytically in the Euclidean region. To express the final result, we introduce a new representation of weight six functions in terms of one-fold integrals over the product of weight-three functions with weight-two kernels that are derived from the differential equation. Our work paves the way to the analytic computation of three-loop multi-leg Feynman integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of the charm-anticharrm ($c{\bar c}$) asymmetry of the proton eigenstate obtained from QCD lattice gauge to the asymmetry of $D^+D^-$ and $D^0{\bar D}^0$ mesons produced in $pp$ collisions at large Feynman variables $x$. It is shown that an important tool for the establishing the intrinsic charm (IC) content of the proton is the charm hadron-antihadron asymmetry formed in $pp$ collisions. Predictions for the asymmetry as function of $x$ for different IC probabilities are presented. We show that the interference of the intrinsic $|uud c{\bar c}&gt;$ Fock state with the standard contribution from the PQCD evolution leads to a large $D^+D^-$ asymmetry at large Feynman $x$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid high-energy factorization and evolution at NLO from the high-energy limit of collinear factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the scheme of NLO computations of generic observables in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions within the framework of high-energy factorization (HEF) with one off-shell initial-state parton, by taking a high-energy limit of the NLO computation in collinear factorization (CF). The NLO terms belonging to the projectile and target are identified and the ambiguity of projectile-target separation is related with the Collins-Soper scale ($\mu_Y$). The NLO unintegrated PDF(UPDF) is constructed in terms of the usual PDFs, and its $\mu_Y$-evolution reproduces the Collins-Soper-Sterman equation in the TMD limit ($|k_\perp|\ll \mu_Y$). The resummation of high-energy logarithms is taken care of by the BFKL-Collins-Ellis evolution of the Green's function in the UPDF.</description>

Abstract: A new approach is presented to compute entropy for massless scalar quantum fields. By perturbing a skewed correlation matrix composed of field operator correlation functions, the mutual information is obtained for disjoint spherical regions of size $r$ at separation $R$, including an expansion to all orders in $r/R$. This approach also permits a perturbative expansion for the thermal field entropy difference in the small temperature limit ($T \ll 1/r$).</description>

      <title>Neutrino fast flavor oscillations with moments: linear stability analysis and application to neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing an accurate modeling of neutrino physics in dense astrophysical environments such as binary neutron star mergers presents a challenge for hydrodynamic simulations. Nevertheless, understanding how flavor transformation can occur and affect the dynamics, the mass ejection, and the nucleosynthesis will need to be achieved in the future. Computationally expensive, large-scale simulations frequently evolve the first classical angular moments of the neutrino distributions. By promoting these quantities to matrices in flavor space, we develop a linear stability analysis of fast flavor oscillations using only the first two "quantum" moments, which notably requires generalizing the classical closure relations that appropriately truncate the hierarchy of moment equations in order to treat quantum flavor coherence. After showing the efficiency of this method on a well-understood test situation, we perform a systematic search of the occurrence of fast flavor instabilities in a neutron star merger simulation. We discuss the successes and shortcomings of moment linear stability analysis, as this framework provides a time-efficient way to design and study better closure prescriptions in the future.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we present mass-ratio measurements on highly charged Yb$^{42+}$ ions with a precision of $4\times 10^{-12}$ and isotope-shift measurements on Yb$^{+}$ on the $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\to$ $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\to$ $^{2}$F$_{7/2}$ transitions with a precision of $4\times 10^{-9}$ for the isotopes $^{168,170,172,174,176}$Yb. We present a new method that allows us to extract higher-order changes in the nuclear charge distribution along the Yb isotope chain, benchmarking ab-initio nuclear structure calculations. Additionally, we perform a King plot analysis to set bounds on a fifth force in the keV$/c^2$ to MeV$/c^2$ range coupling to electrons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Hypertriton and Antihypertriton Spins from Their Global Polarizations in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei is crucial for constraining the nature of hyperon-nucleon ($Y\text{-}N$) interactions, which plays a key role in determining the inner structure of compact stars. The lightest hypernuclei and antihypernuclei are the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda\text{H}$), which consists of a pair of nucleons and a $\Lambda$ hyperon, and its antinucleus (${^3_{\bar{\Lambda}}}\overline{\rm H}$). Significant knowledge has recently been acquired regarding the mass, lifetime, and binding energy of $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$. However, its exact spin, whether $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{2}$, remains undetermined in both experimental and theoretical studies. Here, we present a novel method of using the hypertriton global polarization in heavy-ion collisions to decipher not only its total spin but also its internal spin structure. This method is based on the finding that its three different spin structures exhibit distinct beam energy dependence of its global polarization when it is produced in these collisions from the coalescence of proton, neutron and $\Lambda$. Future observations of the hypertriton and antihypertriton global polarizations thus provide the opportunity to unveil the spin structures of hypertriton and antihypertriton and their production mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small numbers of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel experimental method to quantify contribution of preferential emission to the pseudorapidity distribution of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions using correlations between spectator asymmetry and final-state multiplicity. Within a transport model, the magnitude of this correlator increases from mid to forward rapidities, reflecting the impact of preferential emission and capturing fluctuations in sources of particle production. The correlator demonstrates sensitivity to spectator number fluctuations arising from evaporation or fragmentation, providing a handle to constrain such dynamics. This method serves as a powerful tool to probe particle production mechanisms and the space-time evolution of spectator matter in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Hyperons during proto-neutron star deleptonization and the emission of dark flavoured particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complementary to high-energy experimental efforts, indirect astrophysical searches of particles beyond the standard model have long been pursued. The present article follows the latter approach and considers, for the first time, the self-consistent treatment of the energy losses from dark flavoured particles produced in the decay of hyperons during a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). To this end, general relativistic supernova simulations in spherical symmetry are performed, featuring six-species Boltzmann neutrino transport, and covering the long-term evolution of the nascent remnant proto-neutron star (PNS) deleptonization for several tens of seconds. A well-calibrated hyperon equation of state (EOS) is therefore implemented into the supernova simulations and tested against the corresponding nucleonic model. It is found that supernova observables, such as the neutrino signal, are robustly insensitive to the appearance of hyperons for the simulation times considered in the present study. The presence of hyperons enables an additional channel for the appearance of dark sector particles, which is considered at the level of the $\Lambda$ hyperon decay. Assuming massless particles that escape the PNS after being produced, these channels expedite the deleptonizing PNS and the cooling behaviour. This, in turn, shortens the neutrino emission timescale. The present study confirms the previously estimated upper limits on the corresponding branching ratios for low and high mass PNS, by effectively reducing the neutrino emission timescale by a factor of two. This is consistent with the classical argument deduced from the neutrino detection associated with SN1987A.</description>

      <title>L\'evy walk of pions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of L\'evy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed random walks, plays a role in various phenomena, from chemical and microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical interpretation supporting such findings is still debated. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta stop changing, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter and the interactions among its constituents. In this paper, we introduce a three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilising Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to L\'evy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that simulated pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric L\'evy-stable distribution.</description>

      <title>The Energy Sharing Timescale in an Analytic Framework for Common Envelope Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new predictive theory for the analysis of common envelope (CE) events which incorporates the effects of relevant hydrodynamical processes into a simple analytical framework. We introduce the ejection and dynamical parameters $\xi$ and $\beta$, which define if envelope ejection is energetically or hydrodynamically favorable, respectively, during CE inspiral. When combined, these parameters offer a detailed narrative of how inspiral begins, proceeds, and ends that is consistent with preliminary comparisons to 3D hydrodynamical models. This physically-motivated framework impacts predictions for CE outcomes, especially for systems that have energy excess, and offers promise as a potential alternative for the treatment of CE in binary population synthesis.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Black Holes as Sources of High-Energy Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \textit{memory burden} effect, stating that the amount of information stored within a system contributes to its stabilization, is particularly significant in systems with a high capacity for information storage such as black holes (BHs). In these systems, the evaporation process is halted, at the latest, after approximately half of the BH's initial mass has been radiated away. Consequently, light primordial BHs (PBHs) of mass $m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{15}$\,g, which are expected to have fully evaporated by present time, may remain viable candidates for dark matter (DM). In this scenario, we demonstrate that their mergers would continue to occur today, leading to the formation of ``young'' BHs that resume evaporating, producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays detectable by current experiments. The emission spectrum would be thermal in all Standard Model particle species, offering a clear and distinguishable signature. Current measurements of the isotropic neutrino flux at Earth are in tension with light PBHs as DM candidates within the mass range $7\times10^3\lesssim m_{\rm PBH}/{\rm g}\lesssim 4\times 10^8$. Contrarily to existing bounds, our results depend uniquely on the mass of the remnant and not on the specific model building details of the stabilized phase. We also discuss the potential for refining these constraints through gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observations, as well as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Chiral-Gravitational Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze causality and unitarity constraints in graviton scattering amplitudes, aiming to establish new bounds on theories with $U(1)$-gravitational anomalies, such as axion models or strongly-coupled gauge theories. For this purpose, we show the necessity of coupling these theories to gravity. We obtain a universal scale $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ at which states with $J\geq 4$ must appear in the theory. We show that this scale can lie below the quantum gravity scale. For axion models, we get $\Lambda_{\rm caus}\sim\sqrt{M_P f_a}$ where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant. In strongly-coupled gauge theories in the large-$N_c$ limit, the presence of glueballs allows to evade these bounds, provided the number of fermions $N_F\ll N_c$ and the 'tHooft coupling is not large. Nevertheless, for models that have a holographic 5D dual (large 'tHooft coupling), $\Lambda_{\rm caus}$ emerges as a new cutoff scale, unless certain conditions on the parameters of the 5D models are satisfied.</description>

      <title>The EFT of Large Spin Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use effective string theory to study mesons with large spin $J$ in large $N_c$ QCD as rotating open strings. In the first part of this work, we formulate a consistent effective field theory (EFT) for open spinning strings with light quarks. Our EFT provides a consistent treatment of the endpoints' singularities that arise in the massless limit. We obtain results, in a systematic $1/J$ expansion, for the spectrum of the leading and daughter Regge trajectories. Interestingly, we find that the redshift factor associated with the quarks' acceleration implies that the applicability regime of the EFT is narrower compared to that of static flux tubes. In the second part of this work, we discuss several extensions of phenomenological interests, including mesons with heavy quarks, the quarks' spin and the daughter Regge trajectories associated with the worldsheet axion, a massive string mode identified in lattice simulations of $4d$ flux tubes. We compare our predictions with $4d$ QCD spectroscopy data, and suggest potential $stringy$ interpretations of the observed mesons. We finally comment on the relation between the EFT spectrum and the Axionic String Ansatz, a recently proposed characterization of the spectrum of Yang-Mills glueballs.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic non-Gaussianity of ultra slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-Gaussian tail of the curvature fluctuation, $\zeta$, in an inflationary scenario with a transient ultra slow-roll phase that generates a localized large enhancement of the spectrum of $\zeta$. To do so, we implement a numerical procedure that provides the probability distribution of $\zeta$ order by order in perturbation theory. The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important. The relevance of the intrinsic contribution depends on the rapidity with which the transient ultra slow-roll phase occurs, as well as on its duration. Our method cannot be used accurately when the perturbative in-in formalism fails to apply, highlighting the relevance of developing fully non-perturbative approaches to the problem.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>
