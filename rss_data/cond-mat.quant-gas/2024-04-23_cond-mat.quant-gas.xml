      <title>Observation of Momentum Space Josephson Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum space Josephson effect describes the supercurrent flow between weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) at two discrete momentum states. Here, we experimentally observe this exotic phenomenon using a BEC with Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, where the tunneling between two local band minima is implemented by the momentum kick of an additional optical lattice. A sudden quench of the Raman detuning induces coherent spin-momentum oscillations of the BEC, which is analogous to the a.c. Josephson effect. We observe both plasma and regular Josephson oscillations in different parameter regimes. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical model and numerical simulation, and showcase the important role of nonlinear interactions. We also show that the measurement of the Josephson plasma frequency gives the Bogoliubov zero quasimomentum gap, which determines the mass of the corresponding pseudo-Goldstone mode, a long-sought phenomenon in particle physics. The observation of momentum space Josephson physics offers an exciting platform for quantum simulation and sensing utilizing momentum states as a synthetic degree.</description>

      <title>Expansion dynamics of a cylindrical-shell-shaped strongly dipolar condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) formed on a curved surface with a distinct topology has been a hot topic of intense research, in search of new phenomena in quantum physics as well as for its possible application in quantum computing. In addition to the study of a spherical-shell-shaped BEC, we studied the formation of a cylindrical-shell-shaped harmonically-trapped dipolar BEC of $^{164}$Dy atoms theoretically using an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction, meant to stop a collapse at high atom density. To test the robustness of the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC, here we study its expansion in the same model. We find that as the harmonic trap in the $x$ and $y$ directions are removed, maintaining the axial trap, the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC expands in the $x$-$y$ plane without deformation, maintaining its shell-shaped structure. After an adequate radial expansion, the axial trap can be relaxed for a desired axial expansion of the cylindrical-shell-shaped BEC allowing its observation.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum vortex dynamics and vortex-antivortex annihilation in Bose-Einstein condensates with optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluids with strong spatial modulation can be experimentally produced in the area of cold atoms under the influence of optical lattices. Here we address $^{87}$Rb bosons at T=0 K in a flat geometry under the influence of a periodic potential with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. The statics and dynamics of vortex excitations are studied in the case of one dimensional (1D) and of two dimensional (2D) optical lattices, as function of the intensity of the optical lattice. We compute how the vortex energy depends on the position of its core and the energy barrier that a vortex has to surmount in order to move in the superfluid. The dynamics of a vortex dipole, a pair of vortices of opposite chirality, differ profoundly from the case of a uniform superfluid. In the 1D case, when parallel ridges of density are present, the dynamics depends on the positions of the two vortices. If they are in the same channel between two ridges, then the two vortices approach each other until they annihilate each other in a short time. If the two vortices are in distinct channels the dipole undergoes a rigid translation but with a velocity depending on the intensity of the optical lattice and this translation velocity can even change sign with respect to the case of the uniform superfluid. Superimposed on this translation an oscillatory motion is also present. These oscillatory motions can be both longitudinal, i.e. along the channel, as well as transverse. In all cases the transverse motions are one-side, in the sense that the vortex core never crosses the equilibrium position nearest the starting position. In the case of the 2D lattices we study (square, triangular and honeycomb), the two vortices of a dipole move mainly by jumps between equilibrium positions and approach each other until annihilation.</description>

      <title>Gain engineering and topological atom laser in synthetic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent rapid progress of quantum technology, controlling quantum states has become an important subject of study. Of particular interest is the control of open quantum systems, where the system of interest couples to the environment in an essential way. One formalism to describe open systems is the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Photonics systems have been a major platform to study non-Hermitian quantum mechanics due to its flexibility in engineering gain and loss. Ultracold atomic gases have also used to study non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. However, unlike in photonics, gain is not easily controllable in ultracold atomic gases, and exploration of non-Hermitian physics has been limited to control of losses. In this paper, we report engineering of effective gain through evaporative cooling of judiciously chosen initial thermal atoms. We observe resulting formation of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in excited eigenstates of a synthetic lattice. We realize formation of BEC in a topological edge state of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice in the synthetic hyperfine lattice, which can be regarded as atomic laser oscillations at a topological edge mode, i.e. topological atom laser. Gain-loss engineering in ultracold atoms opens a novel prospect to explore open many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Polar-Core Spin Vortices in Inhomogeneous Spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the easy-plane phase, a ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is magnetized in a plane transverse to the applied Zeeman field. This phase supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs), which consist of phase windings of transverse magnetization. Here we show that spin-changing collisions cause a PCV to accelerate down density gradients in an inhomogeneous condensate. The dynamics is well-described by a simplified model adapted from scalar systems, which predicts the dependence of the dynamics on trap tightness and quadratic Zeeman energy. In a harmonic trap, a PCV accelerates radially to the condensate boundary, in stark contrast to the azimuthal motion of vortices in a scalar condensate. In a trap that has a local potential maximum at the centre, the PCV exhibits oscillations around the trap centre, which persist for a remarkably long time. The oscillations coincide with the emission and reabsorption of axial spin waves, which reflect off the condensate boundary.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping and trapping of two-component gap solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Thouless pumping and arresting of gap solitons in a two-component Bose gas loaded into an optical superlattice. We show that, depending on the atomic interactions and chemical potentials, the two solitons can be simultaneously pumped or trapped, but we also identify regimes where one soliton is pumped and the other arrested. These behaviors can be understood by considering an effective model of the system based on a variational approach, which reveals that the soliton width is a suitable qualifier for the observed behaviours: solitons with a larger width get transported, while solitons with a smaller width get trapped. Since these width can be controlled by tuning interactions, it should be possible to observe all behaviours experimentally.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional arrays of Bose-Einstein condensates: interference and stochastic collapse dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate two-dimensional arrays of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) as a new experimental platform with parallel quantum simulation capability. A defect-free array of up to 49 BECs is formed by loading a single BEC with 50,000 atoms into 7*7 optical wells. Each BEC is prepared with independent phases, confirmed by matterwave interference. Based on BEC arrays, we realize fast determination of the phase boundary of BECs with attractive interactions. We also observe the stochastic collapse dynamics from the distribution of atom numbers in the array. We show that the collapse of a BEC can occur much faster than the averaged decay of an ensemble. The BEC arrays enable new forms of experiments to drastically increase the measurement throughput and to quantum simulate, say, large 2D Josephson-junction arrays.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced Kondo effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In metals containing magnetic impurities, conduction electrons screen the magnetic impurities and induce the Kondo effect, i.e., the enhancement of the electrical resistance at low temperatures. Motivated by recent advances in manipulating quantum materials by cavity confinement, we study how the ultrastrong light-matter coupling can affect the Kondo effect. We show that the ultrastrong coupling can enhance the Kondo temperature and give rise to several notable phenomena, including universal scalings of the cavity-modified Kondo effect, the photon occupation number, and the entanglement entropy between the cavity and electrons. The origin of the cavity enhancement can be understood from the mass renormalization due to the cavity-mediated nonlocal electron-electron interaction, which is akin to the polaronic mass enhancement. We combine the unitary transformations and the Gaussian variational states to analyze the quantum impurity system confined in the cavity. Our nonperturbative framework can be applied to a variety of quantum impurity problems influenced by structured quantum electromagnetic environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the resulting fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled 1d cold-atomic gases.</description>

      <title>A Python GPU-accelerated solver for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and applications to many-body cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TorchGPE is a general-purpose Python package developed for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). This solver is designed to integrate wave functions across a spectrum of linear and non-linear potentials. A distinctive aspect of TorchGPE is its modular approach, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary self-consistent and time-dependent potentials, e.g., those relevant in many-body cavity QED models. The package employs a symmetric split-step Fourier propagation method, effective in both real and imaginary time. In our work, we demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency by leveraging GPU computing capabilities. With the integration of the latter technology, TorchGPE achieves a substantial speed-up with respect to conventional CPU-based methods, greatly expanding the scope and potential of research in this field.</description>

      <title>Collective Excitations of Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates: Breathing Mode and Appearance of Anisotropy under Self-Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collective mode of a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equations. The self-gravitating BEC has garnered considerable attention in cosmology and astrophysics, being proposed as a plausible candidate for dark matter. Our inquiry delves into the breathing and anisotropic collective modes by numerically solving the GPP equations and using the variational method. The breathing mode demonstrates a reduction in period with increasing total mass due to the density dependence of the self-gravitating BEC, attributed to the density-dependent nature of self-gravitating BECs, aligning quantitatively with our analytical findings. Additionally, we investigate an anisotropic collective mode in which the quadrupole mode intertwines with the breathing mode. The period of the quadrupole mode exhibits similar total mass dependence to that of the breathing mode. The characteristics of these periods differ from those of a conventional BEC confined by an external potential. Despite the differences in density dependence, the ratio of their periods equals that of the BEC confined by an isotropic harmonic potential. Furthermore, an extension of the variational method to a spheroidal configuration enables the isolation of solely the quadrupole mode from the anisotropic collective mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of particle and entropy flow between two superfluids is often understood in terms of reversible flow carried by an entropy-free, macroscopic wavefunction. While this wavefunction is responsible for many intriguing properties of superfluids and superconductors, its interplay with excitations in non-equilibrium situations is less understood. Here, we observe large concurrent flows of both particles and entropy through a ballistic channel connecting two strongly interacting fermionic superfluids. Both currents respond nonlinearly to chemical potential and temperature biases. We find that the entropy transported per particle is much larger than the prediction of superfluid hydrodynamics in the linear regime and largely independent of changes in the channel's geometry. In contrast, the timescales of advective and diffusive entropy transport vary significantly with the channel geometry. In our setting, superfluidity counterintuitively increases the speed of entropy transport. Moreover, we develop a phenomenological model describing the nonlinear dynamics within the framework of generalised gradient dynamics. Our approach for measuring entropy currents may help elucidate mechanisms of heat transfer in superfluids and superconducting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments we study the interconversion between ultracold atomic and molecular condensates, quantifying the resulting oscillations and their slow decay. We find that near equilibrium the dominant damping source is the decay of condensed molecules into non-condensed pairs, with a pair kinetic energy that is resonant with the frequency of the oscillating atom-molecule interconversions. The decay, however, is non-exponential, as strong population of the resonant pairs leads to Bose enhancement. Introducing an oscillating magnetic field, which periodically modulates the molecular binding energy, enhances the oscillations at short times. However, the resulting enhancement of the pair-production process results in an accelerated decay which rapidly cuts off the initial oscillation growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation is emerging as a powerful tool for uncovering classically unreachable physics such as many-body real-time dynamics. A complete quantification of uncertainties is necessary in order to make precise predictions using simulations on modern-day devices. Therefore, the inherent physical limitations of the device on the parameters of the simulation must be understood. This analysis examines the interplay of errors arising from simulation of approximate time evolution with those due to practical, real-world device constraints. These errors are studied in Heisenberg-type systems on analog quantum devices described by the Ising Hamiltonian. A general framework for quantifying these errors is introduced and applied to several proposed time evolution methods, including Trotter-like methods and Floquet-engineered constant-field approaches. The limitations placed on the accuracy of time evolution methods by current devices are discussed. Characterization of the scaling of coherent effects of different error sources provides a way to extend the presented Hamiltonian engineering methods to take advantage of forthcoming device capabilities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of the quantum geometry of Bloch states, specifically through the band-resolved quantum-metric tensor, on Cooper pairing and flat-band superconductivity in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-Hubbard model. First we analyze the low-lying two-body spectrum exactly, and show that the pairing order parameter is uniform in this four-band lattice. This allowed us to establish direct relations between the superfluid weight of a multiband superconductor and ($i$) the effective mass of the lowest-lying two-body branch at zero temperature, ($ii$) the kinetic coefficient of the Ginzburg-Landau theory in proximity to the critical temperature, and ($iii$) the velocity of the low-energy Goldstone modes at zero temperature. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive numerical analysis of the superfluid weight and Goldstone modes, exploring both their conventional and geometric components at zero temperature.</description>
