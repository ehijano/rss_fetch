      <title>Rigid-Body Attitude Control on $\mathsf{SO(3)}$ using Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a cascaded control architecture, based on nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI), for rigid body attitude control. The proposed controller works directly with the rotation matrix parameterization, that is, with elements of the Special Orthogonal Group $\mathsf{SO(3)}$, and avoids problems related to singularities and non-uniqueness which affect other commonly used attitude representations such as Euler angles, unit quaternions, modified Rodrigues parameters, etc. The proposed NDI-based controller is capable of imposing desired linear dynamics of any order for the outer attitude loop and the inner rate loop, and gives control designers the flexibility to choose higher-order dynamic compensators in both loops. In addition, sufficient conditions are presented in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which ensure that the outer loop controller renders the attitude loop almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS) and the rate loop globally asymptotically stable (GAS). Furthermore, the overall cascaded control architecture is shown to be AGAS in the case of attitude error regulation. Lastly, the proposed scheme is compared with an Euler angles-based NDI scheme from literature for a tracking problem involving agile maneuvering of a multicopter in a high-fidelity nonlinear simulation.</description>

      <title>CyberDep: Towards the Analysis of Cyber-Physical Power System Interdependencies Using Bayesian Networks and Temporal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern-day power systems have become increasingly cyber-physical due to the ongoing developments to the grid that include the rise of distributed energy generation and the increase of the deployment of many cyber devices for monitoring and control, such as the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Such capabilities have made the power system more vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can harm the physical components of the system. As such, it is of utmost importance to study both the physical and cyber components together, focusing on characterizing and quantifying the interdependency between these components. This paper focuses on developing an algorithm, named CyberDep, for Bayesian network generation through conditional probability calculations of cyber traffic flows between system nodes. Additionally, CyberDep is implemented on the temporal data of the cyber-physical emulation of the WSCC 9-bus power system. The results of this work provide a visual representation of the probabilistic relationships within the cyber and physical components of the system, aiding in cyber-physical interdependency quantification.</description>

      <title>Data-based approaches to learning and control by similarity between heterogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes basic definitions of similarity and similarity indexes between admissible behaviors of heterogeneous host and guest systems and further presents a similarity-based learning control framework by exploiting offline sampled data. By exploring helpful geometric properties of the admissible behavior and decomposing it into the subspace and offset components, the similarity indexes between two admissible behaviors are defined as the principal angles between their corresponding subspace components. By reconstructing the admissible behaviors leveraging sampled data, an efficient strategy for calculating the similarity indexes is developed, based on which a similarity-based learning control framework is proposed. It is shown that the host system can directly accomplish the same control tasks by utilizing the successful experience from the guest system, without having to undergo the trial-and-error process.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Online Trajectory Planning for Adaptive Battery Discharging in Fuel Cell Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an online trajectory planning approach for optimal coordination of Fuel Cell (FC) and battery in plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristor has been identified as the fourth fundamental circuit element by Dr. Leon Chua in 1971 and since then it has gathered a lot of interest because of its non-volatility and are considered as a viable solution to the beyond CMOS era computation. Recently, memristor have been used to perform basic logic operations like AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR etc. and are also used in applications like Dot Product Engine, Convolution Neural Networks etc. This paper presents a new behavioural model of memristor then using it to build a 32-bit ripple carry adder. The paper later compares the area, power and time delay of the 32 bit Ripple Carry Adder using memristor with the 45nm CMOS technology and highlights its advantages and pitfalls.</description>

      <title>Grid-Forming Storage Networks: Analytical Characterization of Damping and Design Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a theoretical study on small-signal stability and damping in bulk power systems with multiple grid-forming inverter-based storage resources. A detailed analysis is presented, characterizing the impacts of inverter droop gains and storage size on the slower eigenvalues, particularly those concerning inter-area oscillation modes. From these parametric sensitivity studies, a set of necessary conditions are derived that the design of droop gain must satisfy to enhance damping performance. The analytical findings are structured into propositions highlighting potential design considerations for improving system stability. The findings are illustrated via numerical studies on an IEEE 68-bus grid-forming storage network.</description>

      <title>Robust synchronization and policy adaptation for networked heterogeneous agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust adaptive online synchronization method for leader-follower networks of nonlinear heterogeneous agents with system uncertainties and input magnitude saturation. Synchronization is achieved using a Distributed input Magnitude Saturation Adaptive Control with Reinforcement Learning (DMSAC-RL), which improves the empirical performance of policies trained on off-the-shelf models using Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies. The leader observes the performance of a reference model, and followers observe the states and actions of the agents they are connected to, but not the reference model. The leader and followers may differ from the reference model in which the RL control policy was trained. DMSAC-RL uses an internal loop that adjusts the learned policy for the agents in the form of augmented input to solve the distributed control problem, including input-matched uncertainty parameters. We show that the synchronization error of the heterogeneous network is Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB). Numerical analysis of a network of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems supports our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Recursive Quantization for $\mathcal{L}_2$ Stabilization of a Finite Capacity Stochastic Control Loop with Intermittent State Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of $\mathcal{L}_2$ stabilization of a state feedback stochastic control loop is investigated under different constraints. The discrete time linear time invariant (LTI) open loop plant is chosen to be unstable. The additive white Gaussian noise is assumed to be stationary. The link between the plant and the controller is assumed to be a finite capacity stationary channel, which puts a constraint on the bit rate of the transmission. Moreover, the state of the plant is observed only intermittently keeping the loop open some of the time. In this manuscript both scalar and vector plants under Bernoulli and Markov intermittence models are investigated. Novel bounds on intermittence parameters are obtained to ensure $\mathcal{L}_2$ stability. Moreover, novel recursive quantization algorithms are developed to implement the stabilization scheme under all the constraints. Suitable illustrative examples are provided to elucidate the main results.</description>

      <title>An innovation-based cycle-slip, multipath estimation, detection and mitigation method for tightly coupled GNSS/INS/Vision navigation in urban areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise, consistent, and reliable positioning is crucial for a multitude of uses. In order to achieve high precision global positioning services, multi-sensor fusion techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Vision integration system, combine the strengths of various sensors. This technique is essential for localization in complex environments and has been widely used in the mass market. However, frequent signal deterioration and blocking in urban environments exacerbates the degradation of GNSS positioning and negatively impacts the performance of the multi-sensor integration system. For GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase observation data in the urban environment, we offer an innovation-based cycle slip/multipath estimation, detection, and mitigation (I-EDM) method to reduce the influence of multipath effects and cycle slips on location induced by obstruction in urban settings. The method obtains the innovations of GNSS observations with the cluster analysis method. Then the innovations are used to detect the cycle slips and multipath. Compared with the residual-based method, the innovation-based method avoids the residual overfitting caused by the least square method, resulting in better detection of outliers within the GNSS observations. The vehicle tests carried out in urban settings verify the proposed approach. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of 0.23m, 0.11m, and 0.31m in the east, north and up components can be achieved by the GNSS/INS/Vision tightly coupled system with the I-EDM method, which has a maximum of 21.6% improvement when compared with the residual-based EDM (R-EDM) method.</description>

      <title>An Effective Current Limiting Strategy to Enhance Transient Stability of Virtual Synchronous Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VSG control has emerged as a crucial technology for integrating renewable energy sources. However, renewable energy have limited tolerance to overcurrent, necessitating the implementation of current limiting (CL)strategies to mitigate the overcurrent. The introduction of different CL strategies can have varying impacts on the system. While previous studies have discussed the effects of different CL strategies on the system, but they lack intuitive and explicit explanations. Meanwhile, previous CL strategy have failed to effectively ensure the stability of the system. In this paper, the Equal Proportional Area Criterion (EPAC) method is employed to intuitively explain how different CL strategies affect transient stability. Based on this, an effective current limiting strategy is proposed. Simulations are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink to validate the proposed strategy. The simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed effective CL strategy exhibits superior stability.</description>

      <title>Large-Area Conductor-Loaded PDMS Dielectric Composites for High-Sensitivity Wireless and Chipless Electromagnetic Temperature Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless electromagnetic sensing is a passive, non-destructive technique for measuring physical and chemical changes through permittivity or conductivity changes. However, the readout is limited by the sensitivity of the materials, often requiring complex sampling, particularly in the GHz range. We report capacitive dielectric temperature sensors based on polydimethylsiloxne (PDMS) loaded with 10 vol% of inexpensive, commercially available conductive fillers including copper powder (Cu), graphite powder (GP) and milled carbon fibre powder (CF). The sensors are tested in the range of 20{\deg}C to 110{\deg}C, with enhanced sensitivity from 20 to 60{\deg}C, and relative response of up to 85.5% at 200 MHz for CF loaded capacitors. Additionally, we demonstrate that operating frequency influences the relative sensing response by as much as 15.0% in loaded composite capacitors. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of PDMS-CF capacitors as a sensing element in wirelessly coupled chipless resonant coils tuned to 6.78 MHz with a readout response, in the resonant frequency of the sensor. The wireless readout of the PDMS-CF chipless system exhibited an average sensitivity of 0.38 %{\deg}C-1 which is a 40x improvement over a pristine PDMS-based capacitive sensor and outperforms state of the art frequency-domain radio frequency (RF) temperature sensors including carbon-based composites at higher loadings. Exploiting the high sensitivity, we interrogate the sensor wirelessly using a low-cost and portable open-source NanoVNA demonstrating a relative response in the resonant frequency of the reader coil of 48.5%, with the response in good agreement with the instrumentation-grade vector network analyzers (VNAs), demonstrating that the sensors could be integrated into an inexpensive and portable measurement setup that does not rely on specialty equipment or highly trained operators.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Linear Graphs and Bond Graph Models with Hetero-functional Graphs for System-of-Systems Engineering Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 20th century, individual technology products like the generator, telephone, and automobile were connected to form many of the large-scale, complex, infrastructure networks we know today: the power grid, the communication infrastructure, and the transportation system. Progressively, these networked systems began interacting, forming what is now known as systems-of-systems. Because the component systems in the system-of-systems differ, modeling and analysis techniques with primitives applicable across multiple domains or disciplines are needed. For example, linear graphs and bond graphs have been used extensively in the electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and mechatronic fields to design and analyze a wide variety of engineering systems. In contrast, hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT) has emerged to study many complex engineering systems and systems-of-systems (e.g. electric power, potable water, wastewater, natural gas, oil, coal, multi-modal transportation, mass-customized production, and personalized healthcare delivery systems). This paper seeks to relate hetero-functional graphs to linear graphs and bond graphs and demonstrate that the former is a generalization of the latter two. The contribution is relayed in three stages. First, the three modeling techniques are compared conceptually. Next, these techniques are contrasted on six example systems: (a) an electrical system, (b) a translational mechanical system, (c) a rotational mechanical system, (d) a fluidic system, (e) a thermal system, and (f) a multi-energy (electro-mechanical) system. Finally, this paper proves mathematically that hetero-functional graphs are a formal generalization of both linear graphs and bond graphs.</description>

      <title>Design of CANSAT for Air Quality Monitoring for an altitude of 900 meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and development of NAMBI-VJ, a CANSAT specifically designed for air quality monitoring and stabilization. The CANSAT's cylindrical structure, measuring 310mm in height and 125mm in diameter, is equipped with a mechanical gyroscope for stabilization and a spill-hole parachute for controlled descent. The primary objective of this research is to create a compact, lightweight satellite capable of monitoring air quality parameters such as particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), longitude, and latitude. To achieve this, the CANSAT utilizes Zigbee communication to transmit data to a ground station. Experimental testing involved dropping the CANSAT from an altitude of 900 meters using a drone. The results demonstrate the CANSAT's ability to successfully gather and transmit air quality data, highlighting its potential for environmental monitoring applications.</description>

      <title>A Deep Generative Learning Approach for Two-stage Adaptive Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage adaptive robust optimization is a powerful approach for planning under uncertainty that aims to balance costs of "here-and-now" first-stage decisions with those of "wait-and-see" recourse decisions made after uncertainty is realized. To embed robustness against uncertainty, modelers typically assume a simple polyhedral or ellipsoidal set over which contingencies may be realized. However, these simple uncertainty sets tend to yield highly conservative decision-making when uncertainties are high-dimensional. In this work, we introduce AGRO, a column-and-constraint generation algorithm that performs adversarial generation for two-stage adaptive robust optimization using a variational autoencoder. AGRO identifies realistic and cost-maximizing contingencies by optimizing over spherical uncertainty sets in a latent space using a projected gradient ascent approach that differentiates the optimal recourse cost with respect to the latent variable. To demonstrate the cost- and time-efficiency of our approach experimentally, we apply AGRO to an adaptive robust capacity expansion problem for a regional power system and show that AGRO is able to reduce costs by up to 7.8% and runtimes by up to 77% in comparison to the conventional column-and-constraint generation algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful approach for developing traversability models for off-road navigation, but these models often struggle with inputs unseen during training. Existing methods utilize techniques like evidential deep learning to quantify model uncertainty, helping to identify and avoid out-of-distribution terrain. However, always avoiding out-of-distribution terrain can be overly conservative, e.g., when novel terrain can be effectively analyzed using a physics-based model. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Physics-Informed Evidential Traversability (PIETRA), a self-supervised learning framework that integrates physics priors directly into the mathematical formulation of evidential neural networks and introduces physics knowledge implicitly through an uncertainty-aware, physics-informed training loss. Our evidential network seamlessly transitions between learned and physics-based predictions for out-of-distribution inputs. Additionally, the physics-informed loss regularizes the learned model, ensuring better alignment with the physics model. Extensive simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate that PIETRA improves both learning accuracy and navigation performance in environments with significant distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Angular Spread Statistics for 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Mid-Band Frequencies in an Indoor Hotspot Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present detailed multipath propagation spatial statistics for next-generation wireless systems operating at lower and upper mid-band frequencies spanning 6--24 GHz. The large-scale spatial characteristics of the wireless channel include Azimuth angular Spread of Departure (ASD) and Zenith angular Spread of Departure (ZSD) of multipath components (MPC) from a transmitter and the Azimuth angular Spread of Arrival (ASA) and Zenith angular Spread of Arrival (ZSA) at a receiver. The angular statistics calculated from measurements were compared with industry-standard 3GPP models, and ASD and ASA values were found to be in close agreement at both 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz. Measured LOS ASD was found larger than 3GPP ASD indicating more diverse MPC departure directions in the azimuth. ZSA and ZSD were observed smaller than the 3GPP modeling results as most multipath arrivals and departures during measurements were recorded at the boresight antenna elevation. The wide angular spreads indicate a multipath-rich spatial propagation at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, showing greater promise for the implementation of MIMO beamforming systems in the mid-band spectrum.</description>

      <title>RoboKoop: Efficient Control Conditioned Representations from Visual Input in Robotics using Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing agents that can perform complex control tasks from high-dimensional observations is a core ability of autonomous agents that requires underlying robust task control policies and adapting the underlying visual representations to the task. Most existing policies need a lot of training samples and treat this problem from the lens of two-stage learning with a controller learned on top of pre-trained vision models. We approach this problem from the lens of Koopman theory and learn visual representations from robotic agents conditioned on specific downstream tasks in the context of learning stabilizing control for the agent. We introduce a Contrastive Spectral Koopman Embedding network that allows us to learn efficient linearized visual representations from the agent's visual data in a high dimensional latent space and utilizes reinforcement learning to perform off-policy control on top of the extracted representations with a linear controller. Our method enhances stability and control in gradient dynamics over time, significantly outperforming existing approaches by improving efficiency and accuracy in learning task policies over extended horizons.</description>

      <title>Envisioning an Optimal Network of Space-Based Lasers for Orbital Debris Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid increase in resident space objects, including satellites and orbital debris, threatens the safety and sustainability of space missions. This paper explores orbital debris remediation using laser ablation with a network of collaborative space-based lasers. A novel delta-v vector analysis framework quantifies the effects of multiple simultaneous laser-to-debris (L2D) engagements by leveraging a vector composition of imparted delta-v vectors. The paper introduces the Concurrent Location-Scheduling Problem (CLSP), which optimizes the placement of laser platforms and schedules L2D engagements to maximize debris remediation capacity. Due to the computational complexity of CLSP, it is decomposed into two sequential subproblems: (1) optimal laser platform locations are determined using the Maximal Covering Location Problem, and (2) a novel integer linear programming-based approach schedules L2D engagements within the network configuration to maximize remediation capacity. Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed framework's effectiveness under various mission scenarios, demonstrating key network functions such as collaborative nudging, deorbiting, and just-in-time collision avoidance. A cost-benefit analysis further explores how varying the number and distribution of laser platforms affects debris remediation capacity, providing insights into optimizing the performance of space-based laser networks.</description>

      <title>Non-stationary and Sparsely-correlated Multi-output Gaussian Process with Spike-and-Slab Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) is commonly used as a transfer learning method to leverage information among multiple outputs. A key advantage of MGP is providing uncertainty quantification for prediction, which is highly important for subsequent decision-making tasks. However, traditional MGP may not be sufficiently flexible to handle multivariate data with dynamic characteristics, particularly when dealing with complex temporal correlations. Additionally, since some outputs may lack correlation, transferring information among them may lead to negative transfer. To address these issues, this study proposes a non-stationary MGP model that can capture both the dynamic and sparse correlation among outputs. Specifically, the covariance functions of MGP are constructed using convolutions of time-varying kernel functions. Then a dynamic spike-and-slab prior is placed on correlation parameters to automatically decide which sources are informative to the target output in the training process. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for efficient model fitting. Both numerical studies and a real case demonstrate its efficacy in capturing dynamic and sparse correlation structure and mitigating negative transfer for high-dimensional time-series data. Finally, a mountain-car reinforcement learning case highlights its potential application in decision making problems.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Drifting Based on Maximal Safety Probability Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel learning-based framework for autonomous driving based on the concept of maximal safety probability. Efficient learning requires rewards that are informative of desirable/undesirable states, but such rewards are challenging to design manually due to the difficulty of differentiating better states among many safe states. On the other hand, learning policies that maximize safety probability does not require laborious reward shaping but is numerically challenging because the algorithms must optimize policies based on binary rewards sparse in time. Here, we show that physics-informed reinforcement learning can efficiently learn this form of maximally safe policy. Unlike existing drift control methods, our approach does not require a specific reference trajectory or complex reward shaping, and can learn safe behaviors only from sparse binary rewards. This is enabled by the use of the physics loss that plays an analogous role to reward shaping. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through lane keeping in a normal cornering scenario and safe drifting in a high-speed racing scenario.</description>

      <title>Robust Q-Learning under Corrupted Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in analyzing the non-asymptotic behavior of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms. However, the performance of such algorithms in non-ideal environments, such as in the presence of corrupted rewards, is poorly understood. Motivated by this gap, we investigate the robustness of the celebrated Q-learning algorithm to a strong-contamination attack model, where an adversary can arbitrarily perturb a small fraction of the observed rewards. We start by proving that such an attack can cause the vanilla Q-learning algorithm to incur arbitrarily large errors. We then develop a novel robust synchronous Q-learning algorithm that uses historical reward data to construct robust empirical Bellman operators at each time step. Finally, we prove a finite-time convergence rate for our algorithm that matches known state-of-the-art bounds (in the absence of attacks) up to a small inevitable $O(\varepsilon)$ error term that scales with the adversarial corruption fraction $\varepsilon$. Notably, our results continue to hold even when the true reward distributions have infinite support, provided they admit bounded second moments.</description>

      <title>Dual-TSST: A Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Transformer Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals allows access to user intentions conveniently, which plays an important role in the fields of human-machine interaction. To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications.</description>

      <title>On Using Curved Mirrors to Decrease Shadowing in VLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) complements radio frequency in indoor environments with large wireless data traffic. However, VLC is hindered by dramatic path losses when an opaque object is interposed between the transmitter and the receiver. Prior works propose the use of plane mirrors as optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) to enhance communications through non-line-of-sight links. Plane mirrors rely on their orientation to forward the light to the target user location, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper studies the potential of curved mirrors as static reflective surfaces to provide a broadening specular reflection that increases the signal coverage in mirror-assisted VLC scenarios. We study the behavior of paraboloid and semi-spherical mirrors and derive the irradiance equations. We provide extensive numerical and analytical results and show that curved mirrors, when developed with proper dimensions, may reduce the shadowing probability to zero, while static plane mirrors of the same size have shadowing probabilities larger than 65%. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio offered by curved mirrors may suffice to provide connectivity to users deployed in the room even when a line-of-sight link blockage occurs.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood inference for high-dimensional problems with multiaffine variable relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of continuous variable models can be very challenging in high dimensions, due to potentially complex probability distributions. The existence of multiple interdependencies among variables can make it very difficult to establish convergence guarantees. This leads to a wide use of brute-force methods, such as grid searching and Monte-Carlo sampling and, when applicable, complex and problem-specific algorithms. In this paper, we consider inference problems where the variables are related by multiaffine expressions. We propose a novel Alternating and Iteratively-Reweighted Least Squares (AIRLS) algorithm, and prove its convergence for problems with Generalized Normal Distributions. We also provide an efficient method to compute the variance of the estimates obtained using AIRLS. Finally, we show how the method can be applied to graphical statistical models. We perform numerical experiments on several inference problems, showing significantly better performance than state-of-the-art approaches in terms of scalability, robustness to noise, and convergence speed due to an empirically observed super-linear convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear identifiability of directed acyclic graphs with partial excitation and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs in the case of partial excitation and measurement. We consider an additive model where the nonlinear functions located in the edges depend only on a past input, and we analyze the identifiability problem in the class of pure nonlinear functions satisfying $f(0)=0$. We show that any identification pattern (set of measured nodes and set of excited nodes) requires the excitation of sources, measurement of sinks and the excitation or measurement of the other nodes. Then, we show that a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is identifiable with a given identification pattern if and only if it is identifiable with the measurement of all the nodes. Next, we analyze the case of trees where we prove that any identification pattern guarantees the identifiability of the network. Finally, by introducing the notion of a generic nonlinear network matrix, we provide sufficient conditions for the identifiability of DAGs based on the notion of vertex-disjoint paths.</description>

      <title>Wind turbine condition monitoring based on intra- and inter-farm federated learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wind energy adoption is growing, ensuring the efficient operation and maintenance of wind turbines becomes essential for maximizing energy production and minimizing costs and downtime. Many AI applications in wind energy, such as in condition monitoring and power forecasting, may benefit from using operational data not only from individual wind turbines but from multiple turbines and multiple wind farms. Collaborative distributed AI which preserves data privacy holds a strong potential for these applications. Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving distributed machine learning approach in this context. We explore federated learning in wind turbine condition monitoring, specifically for fault detection using normal behaviour models. We investigate various federated learning strategies, including collaboration across different wind farms and turbine models, as well as collaboration restricted to the same wind farm and turbine model. Our case study results indicate that federated learning across multiple wind turbines consistently outperforms models trained on a single turbine, especially when training data is scarce. Moreover, the amount of historical data necessary to train an effective model can be significantly reduced by employing a collaborative federated learning strategy. Finally, our findings show that extending the collaboration to multiple wind farms may result in inferior performance compared to restricting learning within a farm, specifically when faced with statistical heterogeneity and imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>Advances in Cislunar Periodic Solutions via Taylor Polynomial Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, novel approaches are developed to explore the dynamics of motion in periodic orbits near libration points in cislunar space using the Differential Algebra (DA) framework. The Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) models the motion, with initial states derived numerically via differential correction. Periodic orbit families are computed using the Pseudo-Arclength Continuation (PAC) method and fitted. Two newly developed polynomial regression models (PRMs) express initial states as functions of predefined parameters and are used in the DA framework to evaluate propagated states. The initial states, expressed via PRM, are propagated in the DA framework using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. The resultant polynomials of both PRM and DA are employed to develop a control law that shows significantly reduced control effort compared to the traditional tracking control law, demonstrating their potential for cislunar space applications, particularly those requiring computationally inexpensive low-energy transfers.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Discrete Event Simulation for Queuing Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Queuing network control is essential for managing congestion in job-processing systems such as service systems, communication networks, and manufacturing processes. Despite growing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, queueing network control poses distinct challenges, including high stochasticity, large state and action spaces, and lack of stability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a scalable framework for policy optimization based on differentiable discrete event simulation. Our main insight is that by implementing a well-designed smoothing technique for discrete event dynamics, we can compute pathwise policy gradients for large-scale queueing networks using auto-differentiation software (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch) and GPU parallelization. Through extensive empirical experiments, we observe that our policy gradient estimators are several orders of magnitude more accurate than typical REINFORCE-based estimators. In addition, We propose a new policy architecture, which drastically improves stability while maintaining the flexibility of neural-network policies. In a wide variety of scheduling and admission control tasks, we demonstrate that training control policies with pathwise gradients leads to a 50-1000x improvement in sample efficiency over state-of-the-art RL methods. Unlike prior tailored approaches to queueing, our methods can flexibly handle realistic scenarios, including systems operating in non-stationary environments and those with non-exponential interarrival/service times.</description>

Abstract: Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid's topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description>

      <title>Parameter Dependent Robust Control Invariant Sets for LPV Systems with Bounded Parameter Variation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time measurements of the scheduling parameter of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems enables the synthesis of robust control invariant (RCI) sets and parameter dependent controllers inducing invariance. We present a method to synthesize parameter-dependent robust control invariant (PD-RCI) sets for LPV systems with bounded parameter variation, in which invariance is induced using PD-vertex control laws. The PD-RCI sets are parameterized as configuration-constrained polytopes that admit a joint parameterization of their facets and vertices. The proposed sets and associated control laws are computed by solving a single semidefinite programing (SDP) problem. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for synthesizing PD-RCI sets, both with respect to conservativeness and computational load.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Optimization and Singular Perturbation via Contraction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel contraction-theoretic approach to analyze two-time scale systems, including those commonly encountered in Online Feedback Optimization (OFO). Our framework endows these systems with several robustness properties, enabling a more comprehensive characterization of their behaviors. The primary assumptions are the contractivity of the fast sub-system and the reduced model, along with an explicit upper bound on the time-scale parameter. For two-time scale systems subject to disturbances, we show that the distance between solutions of the nominal system and solutions of its reduced model is uniformly upper bounded by a function of contraction rates, Lipschitz constants, the time-scale parameter, and the variability of the disturbances over time. Applying these general results to the OFO context, we establish new individual tracking error bounds, showing that solutions converge to their time-varying optimizer, provided the plant and steady-state feedback controller exhibit contractivity and the controller gain is suitably bounded. Finally, we explore two special cases: for autonomous nonlinear systems, we derive sharper bounds than those in the general results, and for linear time-invariant systems, we present novel bounds based on induced matrix norms and induced matrix log norms.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Frequency Domain Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-parametric frequency-domain system identification from a finite-sample perspective. We assume an open loop scenario where the excitation input is periodic and consider the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE), where the goal is to estimate the frequency response at certain desired (evenly-spaced) frequencies, given input-output samples. We show that under sub-Gaussian colored noise (in time-domain) and stability assumptions, the ETFE estimates are concentrated around the true values. The error rate is of the order of $\mathcal{O}((d_{\mathrm{u}}+\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{u}}d_{\mathrm{y}}})\sqrt{M/N_{\mathrm{tot}}})$, where $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total number of samples, $M$ is the number of desired frequencies, and $d_{\mathrm{u}},\,d_{\mathrm{y}}$ are the dimensions of the input and output signals respectively. This rate remains valid for general irrational transfer functions and does not require a finite order state-space representation. By tuning $M$, we obtain a $N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/3}$ finite-sample rate for learning the frequency response over all frequencies in the $ \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm. Our result draws upon an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to semi-infinite matrices. We study the finite-sample behavior of ETFE in simulations.</description>

      <title>Combined Plant and Control Co-design via Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation Based on Physics-informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses integrated design of engineering systems, where physical structure of the plant and controller design are optimized simultaneously. To cope with uncertainties due to noises acting on the dynamics and modeling errors, an Uncertain Control Co-design (UCCD) problem formulation is proposed. Existing UCCD methods usually rely on uncertainty propagation analyses using Monte Calro methods for open-loop solutions of optimal control, which suffer from stringent trade-offs among accuracy, time horizon, and computational time. The proposed method utilizes closed-loop solutions characterized by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) defined on the state space. A solution algorithm for the proposed UCCD formulation is developed based on PDE solutions of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Numerical examples of regulator design problems are provided, and it is shown that simultaneous update of PINN weights and the design parameters effectively works for solving UCCD problems.</description>

      <title>Using matrix sparsification to solve tropical linear vector equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linear vector equation in two unknown vectors is examined in the framework of tropical algebra dealing with the theory and applications of semirings and semifields with idempotent addition. We consider a two-sided equation where each side is a tropical product of a given matrix by one of the unknown vectors. We use a matrix sparsification technique to reduce the equation to a set of vector inequalities that involve row-monomial matrices obtained from the given matrices. An existence condition of solutions for the inequalities is established, and a direct representation of the solutions is derived in a compact vector form. To illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the obtained result with that of an existing solution procedure, we apply our solution technique to handle two-sided equations known in the literature. Finally, a computational scheme based on the approach to derive all solutions of the two-sided equation is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Physical systems transition between states with finite speed that is limited by energetic costs. In this work, we derive bounds on transition times for general Langevin systems that admit a decomposition into reversible and irreversible dynamics, in terms of the Wasserstein distance between states and the energetic costs associated with respective reversible and irreversible currents. For illustration we discuss Brownian particles subject to arbitrary forcing and an RLC circuit with time-varying inductor.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Multistage Constellation Reconfiguration Using Integer Programming and Sequential Decision-Making Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguring Earth observation satellite constellation systems through multiple stages. The Multi-stage Constellation Reconfiguration Problem (MCRP) aims to maximize the total observation rewards obtained by covering a set of targets of interest through the active manipulation of the orbits and relative phasing of constituent satellites. In this paper, we consider deterministic problem settings in which the targets of interest are known a priori. We propose a novel integer linear programming formulation for MCRP, capable of obtaining provably optimal solutions. To overcome computational intractability due to the combinatorial explosion in solving large-scale instances, we introduce two computationally efficient sequential decision-making methods based on the principles of a myopic policy and a rolling horizon procedure. The computational experiments demonstrate that the devised sequential decision-making approaches yield high-quality solutions with improved computational efficiency over the baseline MCRP. Finally, a case study using Hurricane Harvey data showcases the advantages of multi-stage constellation reconfiguration over single-stage and no-reconfiguration scenarios.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous compensation of input delay and state/input quantization for linear systems via switched predictor feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a switched predictor-feedback law, which achieves global asymptotic stabilization of linear systems with input delay and with the plant and actuator states available only in (almost) quantized form. The control design relies on a quantized version of the nominal predictor-feedback law for linear systems, in which quantized measurements of the plant and actuator states enter the predictor state formula. A switching strategy is constructed to dynamically adjust the tunable parameter of the quantizer (in a piecewise constant manner), in order to initially increase the range and subsequently decrease the error of the quantizers. The key element in the proof of global asymptotic stability in the supremum norm of the actuator state is derivation of solutions' estimates combining a backstepping transformation with small-gain and input-to-state stability arguments, for addressing the error due to quantization. We extend this result to the input quantization case and illustrate our theory with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>On Computation of Approximate Solutions to Large-Scale Backstepping Kernel Equations via Continuum Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide two methods for computation of continuum backstepping kernels that arise in control of continua (ensembles) of linear hyperbolic PDEs and which can approximate backstepping kernels arising in control of a large-scale, PDE system counterpart (with computational complexity that does not grow with the number of state components of the large-scale system). In the first method, we provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs, employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series (in the powers of the ensemble variable). In the second method, we identify a class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be constructed in closed form. We also present numerical examples to illustrate computational efficiency/accuracy of the approaches, as well as to validate the stabilization properties of the approximate control kernels, constructed based on the continuum.</description>
