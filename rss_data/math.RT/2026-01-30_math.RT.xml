      <title>Further results on fuzzy negations and implications induced by fuzzy conjunctions and disjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we deeply investigate some properties of fuzzy negations induced from fuzzy conjunctions (resp. disjunctions), which are then applied to characterizing the fuzzy negations. We further use the obtained characterization of fuzzy negations to explore some properties of $(D,N)$-implications generated from fuzzy disjunctions and negations. We finally describe $(D,N)$-implications (resp. continuous $(D,N)$-implications) generated from fuzzy disjunctions and negations.</description>

      <title>A family of simple $U(\mathfrak{h})$-free modules of rank 2 over $\mathfrak{sl} (2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$-modules over $\mathbb C$ that are free of finite rank as $U(\mathfrak h)$-modules, where $\mathfrak h$ is a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$. Our main result is an explicit classification of the scalar-type simple modules of rank $2$. We also give a criterion for when two such modules are isomorphic. Both the classification and the isomorphism problem reduce to twisted conjugacy classes in $\mbox{GL}_2({\mathbb C}[h])$ and rely on Cohn's standard form.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity and unimodality of cluster monomials of type $A_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The log-concavity of cluster variables of type $A_n$ and cluster monomials of type $A_2$ was established by Chen-Huang-Sun. It is still a conjecture for the cluster monomials of higher rank. In this paper, we prove the log-concavity and unimodality of the cluster monomials of type $A_3$, a substantially more intricate case. Moreover, we refine and extend this conjecture by considering the unimodality and the strongly isomorphism of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Admissible modules over affine Lie superalgebras: The final step in the characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, there have been several attempts to characterize modules over affine Lie superalgebras. One of the main issues in this regard is dealing with zero-level modules. In this paper, we study these modules and {complete the characterization} of simple admissible modules over affine Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Reduction theorems for a conjecture on basis in source algebras of blocks of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this short research note is to present some results about a conjecture of Barker and Gelvin claiming that any source algebra of a block of a finite group has the unit group containing a basis stabilised by the left and right actions of the defect group. We obtain some reduction theorems for the existence of stable unital basis in source algebras of block algebras. Along the way we investigate this problem for the blocks of some finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Center of the affine $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level and pseudo-differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the center of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|1}$ at the critical level is generated by the coefficients in the expansion of the pseudo-differential operator $(\partial_z-u_1(z))\cdots (\partial_z-u_n(z))(\partial_z+u_{n+1}(z))^{-1}$ taking values in the Cartan subalgebra. This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case.
  The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion for Expanding Spherical Averages in Real Rank One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops precise asymptotic formulas for expanding non-spherical averages on compact quotients of real rank-one Lie groups, focusing on $SO(n,1)$ as a model case. Using tools from harmonic analysis and representation theory, the study reduces the analysis of orbit averages to an ordinary (ODE) derived from the action of the Casimir operator.</description>

      <title>On the Integrable Structure of the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the quantum integrable structure of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, formed by an infinite number of commuting Integrals of Motion (IMs) in their current algebra. Focusing for simplicity on the SU(2) case, we obtain the first four commuting higher-spin local IMs, starting from a general SU(2)-invariant ansatz and imposing their commutativity. We further show evidence of their commutativity with quantum non-local IMs, which were already built in the literature as Kondo defects. We then investigate the diagonalization of these local operators on $\widehat{\mathfrak{su}(2)}_k$ Verma modules: we explicitly find the first few eigenvectors and further discuss the affine Bethe ansatz and ODE/IQFT conjectures, which predict the full eigenstates and spectrum of the integrable structure. Our results show a perfect match between the direct diagonalization and these overarching conjectures. We conclude by discussing several outlooks, including multi-current generalisations, massive deformations and a general long-term program towards the first principle quantisation of 2-dimensional integrable sigma-models.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformations of the Tsetlin library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tsetlin library is a random shuffling process on permutations of $n$ letters, where each letter $i$ can be interpreted as a book; book $i$ is brought to the front of the bookshelf with an assigned probability $x_i$. We define a $q$-deformation of the Tsetlin library by replacing the symmetric group action on permutations by the action of the type $A$ Iwahori-Hecke algebra. We compute the stationary distribution and spectrum of this Markov chain by relating it to a Markov chain on complete flags over the finite field vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ and applying techniques from semigroup theory. We also generalize the $q$-Tsetlin library to words (with repeated letters), and compute its stationary distribution and spectrum.</description>

      <title>New examples of non-Fourier-Mukai exact functors via non-isomorphic octahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a triangulated category $\mathscr S$ that admits a full and strong exceptional sequence of three objects with one-dimensional Hom spaces. We show that the isomorphism classes of exact functors from $\mathscr S$ to another triangulated category $\mathscr T$ are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of octahedra in $\mathscr T$ satisfying a natural condition. As an application, we construct an exact functor from $\mathscr S$ to $\mathbf D^b(\Bbbk[x]\text{-}\mathrm{mod})$ that does not admit a dg lift. This provides an explicit example of a non-Fourier-Mukai exact functor between $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^2)$ and $\mathbf D^b(\mathbb P^1)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly construct Maass wave cusp forms associated to Hecke characters on arbitrary real quadratic fields. This result is a generalization of Maass (1949), who constructed Maass wave cusp forms under the assumption that narrow class number is one. We also compute its Petersson inner product explicitly and give a few examples involving dihedral Artin representation.</description>

      <title>Identifiable Equivariant Networks are Layerwise Equivariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between end-to-end equivariance and layerwise equivariance in deep neural networks. We prove the following: For a network whose end-to-end function is equivariant with respect to group actions on the input and output spaces, there is a parameter choice yielding the same end-to-end function such that its layers are equivariant with respect to some group actions on the latent spaces. Our result assumes that the parameters of the model are identifiable in an appropriate sense. This identifiability property has been established in the literature for a large class of networks, to which our results apply immediately, while it is conjectural for others. The theory we develop is grounded in an abstract formalism, and is therefore architecture-agnostic. Overall, our results provide a mathematical explanation for the emergence of equivariant structures in the weights of neural networks during training -- a phenomenon that is consistently observed in practice.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the synchronization zeta function associated with a pair of self-maps of a topological space and investigate its properties. We also define the growth rate of synchronization points and derive an explicit formula in the setting of endomorphisms of compact, connected Abelian groups. In addition, we establish Gauss congruences and describe the asymptotic behavior for the sequence of numbers of synchronization points, under the assumption that the synchronization zeta function is rational. Further, we discuss connections with topological entropy and Reidemeister torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present criteria in terms of dual pairs of exceptional sequences for an abelian category to be highest weight. The criteria are applied in three situations of geometric origin. We give new proofs for the facts that the category of perverse sheaves of middle perversity on complex-analytic manifolds with suitable conditions on the stratification is highest weight and that the derived coherent category of any Grassmannian has a $t$-structure with highest weight heart. Also we show that the abelian null category of any proper birational morphism of regular surfaces is highest weight. For this null category, we give a geometric description of some special objects related to the highest weight structure, such as standard, costandard and characteristic tilting objects.</description>

      <title>Fully exact and fully dualizable module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define fully exact module categories, a subclass of exact module categories over a finite braided tensor category that is stable under the relative Deligne product. In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones.
  The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable.
  In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect.
  As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.</description>

      <title>On the additive image of 0th persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $X$ a finite category and $F$ a finite field, we study the additive image of the functor $\operatorname{H}_0(-,F) \colon \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Top}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$, or equivalently, of the free functor $\operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Set}) \to \operatorname{rep}(X, \mathbf{Vect}_F)$.
  We characterize all finite categories $X$ for which the indecomposables in the additive image coincide with the indecomposable indicator representations and provide examples of quivers of wild representation type where the additive image contains only finitely many indecomposables. Motivated by questions in topological data analysis, we conduct a detailed analysis of the additive image for finite grids. In particular, we show that for grids of infinite representation type, there exist infinitely many indecomposables both within and outside the additive image.
  We develop an algorithm for determining if a representation of a finite category is in the additive image. In addition, we investigate conditions for realizability and the effect of modifications of the source category and the underlying field.
  The paper concludes with a discussion of the additive image of $\operatorname{H}_n(-,F)$ for an arbitrary field $F$, extending previous work for prime fields.</description>

Abstract: We prove that each snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ admits a Langlands dual representation, as conjectured by Frenkel and Hernandez (Lett. Math. Phys. (2011) 96:217-261). Furthermore, we establish an explicit formula, called the Langlands branching rule, which gives the multiplicities in the decomposition of the character of a snake module of the quantum Kac-Moody algebra of type $B_n^{(1)}$ into a sum of characters of irreducible representations of its Langlands dual algebra.</description>

      <title>Depth Preservation and Close-Field Transfer in the Local Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a revised notion of depth for Langlands parameters for tori defined over a nonarchimedean local field \(F\) that restores depth preservation under the local Langlands correspondence (LLC). We leverage that preservation to derive structural results that, taken together, yield a canonical transfer of broad harmonic-analytic results from characteristic \(0\) to characteristic \(p\). When \(F\) has suitably large positive characteristic, we prove a block-by-block equivalence: each Bernstein block of \(G(F)\) is equivalent to a corresponding block for some \(G'(F')\) with \(F'\) of characteristic \(0\) \(\ell\)-close to \(F\); using this, we show that a LLC in characteristic \(0\) corresponds canonically to a LLC in characteristic \(p\). For regular supercuspidals we give a direct, more structured construction via Kaletha. Along the way we recover and extend results on \(\ell\)-close fields -- introducing a depth-transfer function generalizing the normalized Hasse--Herbrand function, proving truncated isomorphisms for arbitrary tori and parahorics, establishing a depth and supercuspidality preserving Kazhdan-type Hecke-algebra isomorphism for arbitrary maximal parahorics of arbitrary connected reductive groups; and a generalized Cartan decomposition for arbitrary maximal parahorics -- thereby subsuming several earlier results in the literature. Collectively, the results let one work in characteristic \(0\) without loss of generality for a wide swath of harmonic analysis on \(p\)-adic groups.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology with support in Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of relations on a level 5 module over the twisted affine Lie algebra $A_2^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <title>Integral cluster structures on quantized coordinate rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop (quantum) cluster algebra structures over arbitrary commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$ and prove that the (quantized) coordinate rings of connected simply-connected complex simple algebraic groups $G$ over $\Bbbk$ admit such structures. We first show that the integral form of the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits an upper quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm\frac{1}{2}}]$ by using a combination of tools from quantum groups, canonical bases and cluster algebras and a previous result of the second and third authors over $\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$. We then obtain (integral) quantum versions of recent results of the first author: when $G$ is not of type $F_4$, the quantized coordinate ring of $G$ admits a quantum cluster algebra structure over $\mathbb{A}'$, where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}$ when $G$ is not of types $G_2$, $E_8$, and $F_4$; $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{A}[(q^2+1)^{-1}]$ when $G$ is of type $G_2$, and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Q}(q^{\frac{1}{2}})$ when $G$ is of type $E_8$. We furthermore prove that the classical versions of these results hold over $\mathbb{A}'$ (where $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}$ if $G$ is not of type $F_4$ or $G_2$ and $\mathbb{A}'=\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{2}]$ if $G$ is of type $G_2$) and that the integral form of the coordinate ring of $G$ of type $F_4$ is an upper cluster algebra. Finally, by using common triangular bases of (quantum) cluster algebras, we prove that the above results also hold under specializations of $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{A}'$ to commutative unital rings $\Bbbk$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>
