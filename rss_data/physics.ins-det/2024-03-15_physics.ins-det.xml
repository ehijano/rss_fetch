      <title>Characterisation of analogue Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor test structures implemented in a 65 nm CMOS imaging process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogue test structures were fabricated using the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co. CMOS 65 nm ISC process. The purpose was to characterise and qualify this process and to optimise the sensor for the next generation of Monolithic Active Pixels Sensors for high-energy physics. The technology was explored in several variants which differed by: doping levels, pixel geometries and pixel pitches (10-25 $\mu$m). These variants have been tested following exposure to varying levels of irradiation up to 3 MGy and $10^{16}$ 1 MeV n$_\text{eq}$ cm$^{-2}$. Here the results from prototypes that feature direct analogue output of a 4$\times$4 pixel matrix are reported, allowing the systematic and detailed study of charge collection properties. Measurements were taken both using $^{55}$Fe X-ray sources and in beam tests using minimum ionizing particles. The results not only demonstrate the feasibility of using this technology for particle detection but also serve as a reference for future applications and optimisations.</description>

      <title>Operation of BGO with SiPM readout at dry ice and liquid nitrogen temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light yield and decay constant of BGO were measured at both dry ice and liquid nitrogen temperatures using two SiPMs directly coupled to a $6\times6\times6$ cm$^2$ cubic BGO crystal. With the measured light yield (5.2$\pm$0.3 PE/keV at dry ice temperature and 10.5$\pm$0.4 PE/keV at liquid nitrogen temperature) and decay constants, potential applications of BGO in ToF-PET and SPECT were discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Humidity Sensitivity of Sensors with TCAD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakdown voltage of silicon sensors without special surface is known to be affected by the ambient humidity. To understand the sensor's humidity sensitivity, Synopsys TCAD was used to simulate n-in-p test structures for different effective relative humidity. Photon emission of hot electrons was imaged with a microscope to locate breakdown in the edge-region of the sensor. The Top-Transient Current Technique was used to measure charge transport near the surface in the breakdown region of the sensor. Using the measurements and simulations, the evolution of the electric field, carrier densities and avalanche breakdown in the periphery of p-bulk silicon sensors is presented.</description>

      <title>Doppler holography for ophthalmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive assessment of retinal health demands reliable and precise methods to measure localized blood perfusion. Despite considerable advancements in imaging techniques, such as indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography, along with optical coherence tomography angiography, their capacity to monitor blood flow dynamics across the cardiac cycle faces significant limitations. For more effective care of those with ocular conditions, innovating new approaches is paramount. Doppler holography, an emerging non-invasive optical imaging technique, meets this challenge by offering high temporal resolution imaging of retinal and choroidal blood flow. Now a burgeoning interdisciplinary research field, Doppler holography intertwines functional optical imaging system design, high-performance computing, and clinical investigation. Through collaborative efforts among universities, industry partners, and ophthalmic clinics, a network for its advancement and application is taking shape. This endeavor promises to propel the discovery of novel functional biomarkers, transforming the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases, refining disease severity categorization, and enhancing therapeutic monitoring-ultimately leading to improved healthcare outcomes.</description>

      <title>Radon Removal Commissioning of the PandaX-4T Cryogenic Distillation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T distillation system, designed for the removal of krypton and radon from xenon, is evaluated for its radon removal efficiency using a $^{222}$Rn source during the online distillation process. The PandaX-4T dark matter detector is employed to monitor the temporal evolution of radon activity. To determine the radon reduction factor, the experimental data of radon atoms introduced into and bypassed the distillation system is compared. The results indicate that the PandaX-4T distillation system achieves a radon reduction factor exceeding 190 at the flow rate of 10 slpm and the reflux ratio of 1.44. Gas-only online distillation process of a flow rate of 20 slpm is also conducted without observing significant reduction of radon levels in the detector. This observation suggests that the migration flow of radon atoms from the liquid phase to the gas phase is limited, and the flow rate of gas circulation and duration of the process are insignificant compared to the total xenon mass of 5.6 tons in the detector. This study provides the experimental supporting the efficient removal of radon at $\sim$Bq level using the PandaX-4T distillation system, which is the prerequisite of the radon background control in the detector. The further operation with higher flow rate will be applied for the real science run in PandaX-4T.</description>

      <title>Temperature Compensation Method of Fluxgate Sensor Based on Polynomial Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluxgate sensors are widely used in the field of low frequency and weak vector magnetic field measurement because of their good performance, such as high resolution and low power consumption. However, during the long-term continuous observation, the drift errors of the fluxgate sensor will occur due to the variable ambient temperature. This paper proposes a temperature compensation method for fluxgate sensors based on polynomial fitting. First, a physical model of the temperature &amp; fluxgate sensor was established on the COMSOL Multiphysics simulation platform, and the influence of temperature on the measurement performance of the fluxgate sensor was analyzed. Second, according to the existing temperature-magnetic field data, a temperature compensation model of the fluxgate sensor was constructed. And compared it with other temperature compensation method, the result shows that the proposed temperature compensation method is relatively simple and can better achieve real-time compensation for sensor application scenarios. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerous laboratory experiments were implemented. The temperature drift is reduced from more than 500 nT before compensation to about 1 nT. The results show that the proposed method has a good temperature compensation effect on the data measured by the fluxgate sensor within a variable temperature background.</description>

      <title>Broadband near-ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The highly energetic photons of ultraviolet light drive electronic and rovibronic transitions in all molecular species. This radiation is thus a prime tool for strongly selective spectroscopic fingerprinting and real-time environmental monitoring if broad spectral coverage, short acquisition times and high spectral resolution is achieved - requirements that are in mutual competition in traditional applications. As a novel approach with intrinsic potency in all three aspects, here we introduce ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy using two broadband ultraviolet frequency combs centered at 871 THz and covering a spectral bandwidth of 35.7 THz. Within a 100 us acquisition time window, we obtain rotational state-resolved absorption spectra of formaldehyde, a prototype molecule with high relevance for laser spectroscopy and environmental sciences. This is the first realization of broadband dual comb spectroscopy in the ultraviolet spectral region and a pioneering tool to allow for real-time monitoring of rovibronic transitions.</description>
