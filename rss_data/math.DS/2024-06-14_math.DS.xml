      <title>Modeling Nonlinear Dynamics from Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing reduced-order models directly from videos of dynamical systems. The method uses a non-intrusive tracking to isolate the motion of a user-selected part in the video of an autonomous dynamical system. In the space of delayed observations of this motion, we reconstruct a low-dimensional attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) whose internal dynamics serves as a mathematically justified reduced-order model for nearby motions of the full system. We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits of non-degenerate lacunary contact forms on prequantization bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-degenerate contact form is lacunary if the indexes of every contractible periodic Reeb orbit have the same parity. To the best of our knowledge, every contact form with finitely many periodic orbits known so far is non-degenerate and lacunary. We show that every non-degenerate lacunary contact form on a suitable prequantization of a closed symplectic manifold $B$ has precisely $r_B$ contractible closed orbits, where $r_B=\dim \mathrm{H}_*(B;{\mathbb Q})$. Examples of such prequantizations include the standard contact sphere and the unit cosphere bundle of a compact rank one symmetric space (CROSS). We also consider some prequantizations of orbifolds, like lens spaces and the unit cosphere bundle of lens spaces, and obtain multiplicity results for these prequantizations.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of the growth rate of digits in Schneider's $p$-adic continued fraction dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}_p$ be the ring of $p$-adic integers and $a_n(x)$ be the $n$-th digit of Schneider's $p$-adic continued fraction of $x\in p\mathbb{Z}_p$. We study the growth rate of the digits $\{a_n(x)\}_{n\geq1}$ from the viewpoint of multifractal analysis. The Hausdorff dimension of the set \[E_{\sup}(\psi)=\Big\{x\in p\mathbb{Z}_p:\ \limsup\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n(x)}{\psi(n)}=1\Big\}\] is completely determined for any $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$ satisfying $\psi(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$. As an application, we also calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection sets \[E^{\sup}_{\inf}(\psi,\alpha_1,\alpha_2)=\left\{x\in p\mathbb{Z}_p:\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\dfrac{a_n(x)}{\psi(n)}=\alpha_1,~\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\dfrac{a_n(x)}{\psi(n)}=\alpha_2\right\}\] for the above function $\psi$ and $0\leq\alpha_1&lt;\alpha_2\leq\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a point set in the Euclidean plane that elucidates the relationship between the fine-scale statistics of the fractional parts of $\sqrt n$ and directional statistics for a shifted lattice. We show that the randomly rotated, and then stretched, point set converges in distribution to a lattice-like random point process. This follows closely the arguments in Elkies and McMullen's original analysis for the gap statistics of $\sqrt{n}$ mod 1 in terms of random affine lattices [Duke Math. J. 123 (2004), 95-139]. There is, however, a curious subtlety: the limit process emerging in our construction is NOT invariant under the standard $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-action on $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics. By extending the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics, we derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for the convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. Our analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequalities. To complement these hypocoercive estimates, we also analyze the limiting behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution, providing sharper convergence rate estimates in this asymptotic regime. A number of concrete examples are provided as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Sparse reconstruction in spin systems II: Ising and other factor of IID measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>On averages of completely multiplicative functions over co-prime integer pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied the asymptotic behavior of the averages of completely multiplicative functions over the Gaussian integers. They derived Wirsing's theorem for Gaussian integers, answered a question of Frantzikinakis and Host for sum of two squares, and obtained a variant of a theorem of Bergelson and Richter on ergodic averages along the number of prime factors of integers. In this paper, we will show the analogue of these results for co-prime integer pairs. Moreover, building on Frantzikinakis and Host's results, we obtain some convergences on the multilinear averages of multiplicative functions over primitive lattice points.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the action of semigroups with nonempty interior of noncompact connected semisimple Lie groups, with finite center, on their maximal compact connected subgroups. As main results we describe the set of transitivity of a control set as fixed points of regular elements in the semigroup, and determine the number of control sets.</description>

      <title>Local connectivity of boundaries of tame Fatou components of meromorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove local connectivity of the boundaries of invariant simply connected attracting basins for a class of transcendental meromorphic maps. The maps within this class need not be geometrically finite or in class $\mathcal B$, and the boundaries of the basins (possibly unbounded) are allowed to contain an infinite number of post-singular values, as well as the essential singularity at infinity. A basic assumption is that the unbounded parts of the basins are contained in regions which we call `repelling petals at infinity', where the map exhibits a kind of `parabolic' behaviour. In particular, our results apply to a wide class of Newton's methods for transcendental entire maps. As an application, we prove local connectivity of the Julia set of Newton's method for $\sin z$, providing the first non-trivial example of a locally connected Julia set of a transcendental map outside class $\mathcal B$, with an infinite number of unbounded Fatou components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conditions under which the germinal groupoid associated to a minimal equicontinuous action of a countable group on a Cantor set has non-Hausdorff topology. We develop a new criterion, which serves as an obstruction for the \'etale topology on the groupoid to be non-Hausdorff. We use this and other criteria to study the topology of germinal groupoids for a few classes of actions. In particular, we give examples of families of contracting and non-contracting self-similar groups, which are amenable and whose actions have associated germinal groupoids with non-Hausdorff topology.</description>

      <title>A Large deviations principle at zero temperature for stationary Markov equilibrium states on countable Markov shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a topologically transitive unilateral countable Markov shift $\Sigma$, a locally constant potential $\phi : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying suitable conditions, and assume that $\mu_t$ is the unique stationary Markov equilibrium state associated to the potential $t\phi$ for each $t \geq 1$. In this paper we prove a first level large deviations principle at zero temperature for the family of equilibrium states $(\mu_t)_{t \geq 1}$ and we extend the result to the setting of bilateral countable Markov shifts.</description>

Abstract: To any $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb Q^n$ one can naturally associate a point in the Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}_{n,k}(\mathbb R)$ and two shapes of lattices of rank $k$ and $n-k$ respectively. These lattices originate by intersecting the $k$-dimensional subspace with the lattice $\mathbb Z^n$. Using unipotent dynamics we prove simultaneous equidistribution of all of these objects under a congruence conditions when $(k,n) \neq (2,4)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we present a stochastic dynamic model which can explain economic cycles. We show that the macroscopic description yields a complex dynamical landscape consisting of multiple stable fixed points, each corresponding to a split of the population into a large low and a small high income group. The stochastic fluctuations induce switching between the resulting metastable states, and excitation oscillations just below a deterministic bifurcation. The shocks are caused by the decisions of a few agents who have a disproportionate influence over the macroscopic state of the economy due to the unequal distribution of wealth among the population. The fluctuations have a long-term effect on the growth of economic output and lead to business cycle oscillations exhibiting coherence resonance, where the correlation time is controlled by the population size which is inversely proportional to the noise intensity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building mathematical models of brains is difficult because of the sheer complexity of the problem. One potential starting point is through basal cognition, which give abstract representation of a range of organisms without central nervous systems, including fungi, slime moulds and bacteria. We propose one such model, demonstrating how a combination of oscillatory and current-based reinforcement processes can be used to couple resources in an efficient manner, mimicking the way these organisms function. A key ingredient in our model, not found in previous basal cognition models, is that we explicitly model oscillations in the number of particles (i.e. the nutrients, chemical signals or similar, which make up the biological system) and the flow of these particles within the modelled organisms. Using this approach, we find that our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We further demonstrate that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. In the context of these findings, we discuss connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, how oscillations might contribute to self-organised problem-solving by these organisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we address the challenges of image super-resolution and noise reduction, which are crucial for enhancing the quality of images derived from low-resolution or noisy data. We compared and assessed several approaches for upgrading low-resolution images to higher resolutions and for eliminating unwanted noise, all while maintaining the essential characteristics of the original images and recovering images from poor quality or damaged data using deep learning models. Our analysis and the experimental outcomes on image quality metrics indicate that the EDCNN neural network model, enhanced with pretrained weights, significantly outperforms other methods with a Train PSNR of 31.215, a Valid PSNR of 29.493, and a Test PSNR of 31.6632.</description>
