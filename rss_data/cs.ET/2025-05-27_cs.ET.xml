      <title>Smart Waste Management System for Makkah City using Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waste management is a critical global issue with significant environmental and public health implications. It has become more destructive during large-scale events such as the annual pilgrimage to Makkah, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest religious gatherings. This event's popularity has attracted millions worldwide, leading to significant and un-predictable accumulation of waste. Such a tremendous number of visitors leads to in-creased waste management issues at the Grand Mosque and other holy sites, highlighting the need for an effective solution other than traditional methods based on rigid collection schedules.
  To address this challenge, this research proposed an innovative solution that is context-specific and tailored to the unique requirements of pilgrimage season: a Smart Waste Management System, called TUHR, that utilizes the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This system encompasses ultrasonic sensors that monitor waste levels in each container at the performance sites. Once the container reaches full capacity, the sensor communicates with the microcontroller, which alerts the relevant authorities. Moreover, our system can detect harmful substances such as gas from the gas detector sensor. Such a proactive and dynamic approach promises to mitigate the environmental and health risks associated with waste accumulation and enhance the cleanliness of these sites. It also delivers economic benefits by reducing unnecessary gasoline consumption and optimizing waste management resources. Importantly, this research aligns with the principles of smart cities and exemplifies the innovative, sustainable, and health-conscious approach that Saudi Arabia is implementing as part of its Vision 2030 initiative.</description>

      <title>NextG-GPT: Leveraging GenAI for Advancing Wireless Networks and Communication Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless networking advancements have created new opportunities to enhance network efficiency and performance. In this paper, we introduce Next-Generation GPT (NextG-GPT), an innovative framework that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) within the wireless systems' domain. By leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs alongside a domain-specific knowledge base, NextG-GPT provides context-aware real-time support for researchers, optimizing wireless network operations. Through a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs, including Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, LLaMa3.1-8B, and LLaMa3.1-70B, we demonstrate significant improvements in answer relevance, contextual accuracy, and overall correctness. In particular, LLaMa3.1-70B achieves a correctness score of 86.2% and an answer relevancy rating of 90.6%. By incorporating diverse datasets such as ORAN-13K-Bench, TeleQnA, TSpec-LLM, and Spec5G, we improve NextG-GPT's knowledge base, generating precise and contextually aligned responses. This work establishes a new benchmark in AI-driven support for next-generation wireless network research, paving the way for future innovations in intelligent communication systems.</description>

      <title>Systems of Twinned Systems: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern systems exhibit unprecedented complexity due to their increased scale, interconnectedness, and the heterogeneity of their digital and physical components. In response to scaling challenges, the system-of-systems (SoS) paradigm proposes flexible aggregations of subsystems into a larger whole, while maintaining the independence of subsystems to various degrees. In response to the cyber-physical convergence, the digital twin (DT) paradigm proposes a tight coupling between digital and physical components through computational reflection and precise control. As these two paradigms address distinct parts of the overall challenge, combining the two promises more comprehensive methods to engineer what we call systems of twinned systems (SoTS). The noticeably growing body of knowledge on SoTS calls for a review of the state of the art. In this work, we report on our systematic literature survey of SoTS. We screened over 2500 potential studies, of which we included 80 and investigated them in detail. To converge SoS and DT, we derive a classification framework for SoTS that is backward compatible with the currently accepted theories of SoS and DT.</description>

Abstract: This dissertation proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracking device that diagnoses cardiopulmonary problems using the Internet of Things (IoT) desired results. The initiative is built on the internet observing an electrocardiogram with the AD8232 heart rhythm sensor and the ESP32 expansion kit, using an on-premise connected device platform to transform sensing input into meaningful data. That subsequently supervises an ECG signal and delivers it to an intelligent phone via Wi-Fi for data analysis. That is the pace of the circulating. Assessing body temperature, pulse rate, and coronary arteries are vital measures to defend your health. The heartbeat rate may be measured in two ways: there are by palpating the pulse at the wrist or neck directly or other alternative by utilizing a cardiac sensor. Monitoring alcohol levels in cardiac patients is critical for measuring the influence of liquor on their health and the efficacy of therapy. It assists in recognizing the association between alcohol consumption and cardiac issues, rather than rhythm recorded in beats per minute (bpm). An IR transmitter/receiver pair (OLED) needs to stay compatible up near the sensor's knuckle current or voltage pulse. The detector's electrical output is evaluated by suitable electronic circuits to produce a visual clue (digital display). We must design a cost-effective, user-friendly, and efficient ECG monitoring system with contemporary technology for both persons imprisoned by disease or aging, as well as healthcare professionals. Microcontroller combined with software. A smartphone application is created to monitor the cardiovascular health of distant patients in real-time</description>

      <title>An Outlook on the Opportunities and Challenges of Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent AI systems (MAS) offer a promising framework for distributed intelligence, enabling collaborative reasoning, planning, and decision-making across autonomous agents. This paper provides a systematic outlook on the current opportunities and challenges of MAS, drawing insights from recent advances in large language models (LLMs), federated optimization, and human-AI interaction. We formalize key concepts including agent topology, coordination protocols, and shared objectives, and identify major risks such as dependency, misalignment, and vulnerabilities arising from training data overlap. Through a biologically inspired simulation and comprehensive theoretical framing, we highlight critical pathways for developing robust, scalable, and secure MAS in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Performance report of heuristic algorithm that cracked the largest Gset Ising problems (G81 cut=14060)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the past 25 years, the Gset benchmark problems have challenged all manner of Ising and Max-Cut solvers. The largest of these problems have remained unsolved by any heuristic algorithm. In this report we provide data showing dramatically better speed and accuracy on these large sparse problems. Our newly discovered heuristic algorithm called Cosm reaches high (99.9% of best) solution quality orders of magnitude faster than the previous best heuristic solver results. Additionally, when afforded enough steps Cosm attains higher cuts than ever previously reported, specifically on instances G72 (cut=7008), G77 (cut=9940), and the 20,000-variable G81 (cut=14060). This report includes solution bitstrings so that the cuts can be independently validated. Remarkably, the new best solutions appear to be optimal. We believe the results are an early hint of disruptive opportunities for unconventional, hardware-centric approaches to algorithm discovery.</description>

      <title>A Smart Healthcare System for Monkeypox Skin Lesion Detection and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monkeypox is a viral disease characterized by distinctive skin lesions and has been reported in many countries. The recent global outbreak has emphasized the urgent need for scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic solutions to support public health responses.
  In this study, we developed ITMAINN, an intelligent, AI-driven healthcare system specifically designed to detect Monkeypox from skin lesion images using advanced deep learning techniques. Our system consists of three main components. First, we trained and evaluated several pretrained models using transfer learning on publicly available skin lesion datasets to identify the most effective models. For binary classification (Monkeypox vs. non-Monkeypox), the Vision Transformer, MobileViT, Transformer-in-Transformer, and VGG16 achieved the highest performance, each with an accuracy and F1-score of 97.8%. For multiclass classification, which contains images of patients with Monkeypox and five other classes (chickenpox, measles, hand-foot-mouth disease, cowpox, and healthy), ResNetViT and ViT Hybrid models achieved 92% accuracy, with F1 scores of 92.24% and 92.19%, respectively. The best-performing and most lightweight model, MobileViT, was deployed within the mobile application. The second component is a cross-platform smartphone application that enables users to detect Monkeypox through image analysis, track symptoms, and receive recommendations for nearby healthcare centers based on their location. The third component is a real-time monitoring dashboard designed for health authorities to support them in tracking cases, analyzing symptom trends, guiding public health interventions, and taking proactive measures.
  This system is fundamental in developing responsive healthcare infrastructure within smart cities. Our solution, ITMAINN, is part of revolutionizing public health management.</description>

      <title>An Initial Exploration of Fine-tuning Small Language Models for Smart Contract Reentrancy Vulnerability Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being used more and more for various coding tasks, including to help coders identify bugs and are a promising avenue to support coders in various tasks including vulnerability detection -- particularly given the flexibility of such generative AI models and tools. Yet for many tasks it may not be suitable to use LLMs, for which it may be more suitable to use smaller language models that can fit and easily execute and train on a developer's computer. In this paper we explore and evaluate whether smaller language models can be fine-tuned to achieve reasonable results for a niche area: vulnerability detection -- specifically focusing on detecting the reentrancy bug in Solidity smart contracts.</description>

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems are the most powerful tools that we currently have to solve complex scientific simulations. Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to enhance HPC systems by accelerating the execution of specific kernels that can be offloaded to a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), granting them new capabilities, improving the speed of computation, or reducing energy consumption. In this paper, we present QMIO: a state-of-the-art hybrid HPCQC system, which tightly integrates HPC and QC. We describe its hardware and software components, the integration middleware, and the lessons learned during the design, implementation, and operation of the system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Test Efficiency through Automated ATPG-Aware Lightweight Scan Instrumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scan-based Design-for-Testability (DFT) measures are prevalent in modern digital integrated circuits to achieve high test quality at low hardware cost. With the advent of 3D heterogeneous integration and chiplet-based systems, the role of scan is becoming ever more important due to its ability to make internal design nodes controllable and observable in a systematic and scalable manner. However, the effectiveness of scan-based DFT suffers from poor testability of internal nodes for complex circuits at deep logic levels. Existing solutions to address this problem primarily rely on Test Point Insertion (TPI) in the nodes with poor controllability or observability. However, TPI-based solutions, while an integral part of commercial practice, come at a high design and hardware cost. To address this issue, in this paper, we present LITE, a novel ATPG-aware lightweight scan instrumentation approach that utilizes the functional flip-flops in a scan chain to make multiple internal nodes observable and controllable in a low-cost, scalable manner. We provide both circuit-level design as well as an algorithmic approach for automating the insertion of LITE for design modifications. We show that LITE significantly improves the testability in terms of the number of patterns and test coverage for ATPG and random pattern testability, respectively, while incurring considerably lower overhead than TPI-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization Accelerator Framework for Multistate Ising Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising Machines are a prominent class of hardware architectures that aim to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. These machines consist of a network of interacting binary spins/neurons that evolve to represent the optimum ground state energy solution. Generally, combinatorial problems are transformed into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form to harness the computational efficiency of these Ising machines. However, this transformation, especially for multi-state problems, often leads to a more complex exploration landscape than the original problem, thus severely impacting the solution quality. To address this challenge, we model the spin interactions as a generalized boolean logic function to significantly reduce the exploration space. We benchmark the graph coloring problem from the class of multi-state NP-hard optimization using probabilistic Ising solvers to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The proposed methodology achieves similar accuracy compared to state-of-the-art heuristics and machine learning algorithms, and demonstrates significant improvement over the existing Ising methods. Additionally, we demonstrate that combining parallel tempering with our existing framework further reduces the coloring error by up to 50% compared to the conventionally used Gibbs sampling algorithm. We also design a 1024-neuron all-to-all connected probabilistic Ising accelerator that shows up to 10000x performance acceleration compared to heuristics while reducing the number of required physical neurons by 1.5-4x compared to conventional Ising machines. Indeed, this accelerator solution demonstrates improvement across all metrics over the current methods, i.e., energy, performance, area, and solution quality. Thus, this work expands the potential of existing Ising hardware to solve a broad class of these multistate optimization problems.</description>

      <title>V-RoAst: Visual Road Assessment. Can VLM be a Road Safety Assessor Using the iRAP Standard?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road traffic crashes result in millions of deaths annually and significant economic burdens, particularly on Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Road safety assessments traditionally rely on human-labelled data, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced automated road safety assessments, they typically demand large labelled datasets and often require fine-tuning for each new geographic context. This study explores whether Vision Language Models (VLMs) with zero-shot capability can overcome these limitations to serve as effective road safety assessors using the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) standard. Our approach, V-RoAst (Visual question answering for Road Assessment), leverages advanced VLMs, such as Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-4o-mini, to analyse road safety attributes without requiring any labelled training data. By optimising prompt engineering and utilising crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, V-RoAst provides a scalable, cost-effective, and automated solution for global road safety assessments. Preliminary results show that while VLMs achieve lower performance than CNN-based models, they are capable of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and show potential in predicting star ratings from crowdsourced imagery. However, their performance is poor when key visual features are absent in the imagery, emphasising the need for human labelling to address these gaps. Advancements in VLMs, alongside in-context learning such as chain-of-thought and few-shot learning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, present opportunities for improvement, making VLMs promising tools for road assessment tasks. Designed for resource-constrained stakeholders, this framework holds the potential to save lives and reduce economic burdens worldwide. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/PongNJ/V-RoAst.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</title>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Cross-Chain Options: A Bridgeless, Universal, and Efficient Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15724</link>

Abstract: Options are fundamental to blockchain-based financial services, offering essential tools for risk management and price speculation, which enhance liquidity, flexibility, and market efficiency in decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite the growing interest in options for blockchain-resident assets, such as cryptocurrencies, current option mechanisms face significant challenges, including a high reliance on trusted third parties, limited asset support, high trading delays, and the requirement for option holders to provide upfront collateral.
  In this paper, we present a protocol that addresses the aforementioned issues. Our protocol is the first to eliminate the need for holders to post collateral when establishing options in trustless service environments (i.e. without a cross-chain bridge), which is achieved by introducing a guarantee from the option writer. Its universality allows for cross-chain options involving nearly \textit{any} assets on \textit{any} two different blockchains, provided the chains' programming languages can enforce and execute the necessary contract logic. Another key innovation is reducing option position transfer latency, which uses Double-Authentication-Preventing Signatures (DAPS). Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed scheme reduces option transfer latency to less than half of that in existing methods. Rigorous security analysis proves that our protocol achieves secure option trading, even when facing adversarial behaviors.</description>

      <title>Interacting Large Language Model Agents. Interpretable Models and Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the theory and algorithms for interacting large language model agents (LLMAs) using methods from statistical signal processing and microeconomics. While both fields are mature, their application to decision-making involving interacting LLMAs remains unexplored. Motivated by Bayesian sentiment analysis on online platforms, we construct interpretable models and algorithms that enable LLMAs to interact and perform Bayesian inference. Because interacting LLMAs learn from both prior decisions and external inputs, they can exhibit bias and herding behavior. Thus, developing interpretable models and stochastic control algorithms is essential to understand and mitigate these behaviors. This paper has three main results. First, we show using Bayesian revealed preferences from microeconomics that an individual LLMA satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive (bounded rationality) Bayesian utility maximization and, given an observation, the LLMA chooses an action that maximizes a regularized utility. Second, we utilize Bayesian social learning to construct interpretable models for LLMAs that interact sequentially with each other and the environment while performing Bayesian inference. Our proposed models capture the herding behavior exhibited by interacting LLMAs. Third, we propose a stochastic control framework to delay herding and improve state estimation accuracy under 2 settings: (a) centrally controlled LLMAs (b) autonomous LLMAs with incentives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real datasets for hate speech classification and product quality assessment, using open-source models like LLaMA and closed-source models like ChatGPT. The main takeaway of this paper, based on empirical analysis and mathematical formalism, is that LLMAs act as rationally bounded Bayesian agents that exhibit social learning when interacting.</description>

      <title>Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</description>
