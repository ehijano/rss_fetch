      <title>A comprehensive semi-automated fabrication system for quartz tuning fork AFM probe with real-time resonance frequency monitoring and Q-factor control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quartz tuning fork-based atomic force microscopy (QTF-AFM) has become a powerful tool for high-resolution imaging of both conductive and insulating samples, including semiconductor structures and metal-coated surfaces as well as soft matter under ambient conditions, while also enabling measurements in more demanding environments including ultrahigh vacuum and cryogenic conditions where conventional cantilever-based AFM often encounters limitations. However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests. This integrated approach provides a reproducible framework to QTF-based probe fabrication, lowering the technical barrier to QTF-AFM implementation and broadening its applicability across diverse sample types and operating environments.</description>

      <title>Synergy of fivefold boost SOT efficiency and field-free magnetization switching with broken inversion symmetry: Toward neuromorphic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-volatile Neuromorphic Computing (NC) elements utilizing Spin Orbit Torque (SOT) provide a viable solution to alleviate the memory wall bottleneck in contemporary computing systems. However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. This systematic study paves the way to energy-efficient, field-free SOT synapses for practical NC applications.</description>

      <title>Multistability of graphene nanobubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the example of Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms, it is shown that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one "ground"\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers.</description>

      <title>A modified Lindblad equation for a Rabi driven electron-spin qubit with tunneling to a Markovian lead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16306v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a modified Lindblad equation for the state of quantum dot tunnel coupled to a Markovian lead when the spin state of the dot is driven by an oscillating magnetic field. We show that the equation is a completely positive, trace-preserving map and find the jump operators. This is a driven-dissipative regime in which coherent driving is relevant to the tunneling and cannot be treated as simply a rotation modifying the system with a bath derived under a static magnetic field. This work was motivated by an experimental desire to determine the Zeeman splitting of an electron spin on a quantum dot (a spin qubit), and in a related work we show that this splitting energy can be found by measuring the charge occupancy of the dot while sweeping the frequency of the driving field \ arXiv:2503.17481. Here we cover the full derivation of the equation and give the jump operators. These jump operators are potentially useful for describing the stochastic behavior of more complex systems with coherent driving of a spin capable of tunneling on or off of a device, such as in electron spin resonance scanning tunneling microscopy. The jump operators have the interesting feature of combining jumps of electrons onto and off of the device.</description>

      <title>Optical probing of Wigner crystallization in monolayer WSe$_2$ via diffraction of longitudinal excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are characterized by relatively large carrier effective masses and suppressed screening of the Coulomb interaction, which substantially enhances the correlation effects in these structures. The direct band gap allows to effectively optically probe these correlations. Here, we present an experimental observation of Wigner crystallization in monolayer $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ probed by the measurement of the exciton diffraction on the Wigner crystal (WC) periodic potential. We observe the formation of the WC phase in the absence of external magnetic fields at temperature range $T&lt;26~\mathrm{K}$ and carrier concentrations $n$ $&lt;2\times10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The direct observation of the exciton diffraction is enabled by the strong exciton longitudinal-transverse splitting induced by the long-range intervalley exchange interaction, leading to the large detuning between main exciton peak and first diffraction peak. Our findings highlight that the valley degree of freedom of charge carriers in TMDs facilitates optical probing of correlated electron phases in these structures.</description>

      <title>Diffusive and hydrodynamic magnetotransport around a density perturbation in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study current flow around a circular density depletion in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The depletion is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $\beta &gt; 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the depletion region. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\pi (1 - 1 / \beta)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Hot-Electron and Optomechanical Pathways at Metal-Molecule Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy and charge transfer between molecules and metal surfaces underpin heterogeneous catalysis, surface-enhanced spectroscopies and plasmon-driven chemistry, yet the microscopic origins of vibrational excitation at metal interfaces remain unresolved. Here we use temperature-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to directly distinguish plasmon-vibration optomechanical coupling from hot-electron-driven excitation.By probing thionine adsorbed on gold nanostructures at 295 K and 3.5 K, we show that pronounced anti-Stokes scattering at cryogenic temperature arises from optical pumping of vibrational populations, whereas room-temperature spectra are governed by thermal population. Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces.</description>

      <title>A low-tech solution to process entire metal/molecule heterostructure stacks into vertical nanopillar electronic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies aim to assemble devices whose operation is controlled by the quantum state of individual atoms. Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices. We discuss the advantages and pitfalls of the various iterations of this process that were implemented. We also discuss outlooks for this unique technology.</description>

      <title>The 2026 Skyrmionics Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and related topological spin textures have emerged as a central topic in condensed-matter physics, combining fundamental significance with potential for transformative applications in spintronics, magnonics, and beyond. Over the past decade, advances in material platforms, imaging techniques, theoretical modeling, and device concepts have established skyrmionics as a rapidly expanding field. At the same time, challenges remain in stabilizing, controlling, and integrating such textures into functional architectures, while novel phenomena such as antiskyrmions, higher-order skyrmions, hopfions, and antiferromagnetic textures arise. The 2026 Skyrmionics Roadmap represents a collective effort of many authors, providing a comprehensive perspective on the current state-of-the-art and the outlook for the coming years. In 33 focused sections, each co-authored by two researchers, we chart progress in theory and modeling, material systems, skyrmion dynamics, and skyrmion technologies. By offering a consolidated vision, this Roadmap aims to guide both fundamental research and application-driven efforts, accelerating the transition of skyrmionics from conceptual breakthroughs toward practical technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Photoresponse via Acoustic Plasmon Cavity Resonances in Scalable Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control and nanoscale confinement of terahertz (THz) fields are essential requirements for emerging applications in photonics, quantum technologies, wireless communications, and sensing. Here, we demonstrate a polaritonic cavity enhanced THz photoresponse in an antenna coupled device based on chemical vapor deposited (CVD) monolayer graphene. The dipole antenna lobes simultaneously serve as two gate electrodes, concentrate the impinging THz field, and efficiently launch acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs), which drive a strong photo-thermoelectric (PTE) signal. Between 6 and 90 K, the photovoltage exhibits pronounced peaks, modulating the PTE response by up to 40\%, that we attribute to AGPs forming a Fabry P\'erot THz cavity in the full or half graphene channel. Combined full wave and transport thermal simulations accurately reproduce the gate controlled plasmon wavelength, spatial absorption profile, and the resulting nonuniform electron heating responsible for the PTE response. The lateral and vertical maximum confinement factors of the AGP wavelength relative to the incident wavelength are 165 and 4000, respectively, for frequencies from 1.83 to 2.52 THz. These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction.</description>

      <title>Current-induced magnetization control in dipolar-coupled nanomagnet pairs and artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) to manipulate the magnetic state of dipolar-coupled nanomagnet systems with in-plane magnetic anisotropy, such as artificial spin ices, provides a route to local, electrically-programmable control of the magnetization, with relevance for applications including neuromorphic computing. Here, we demonstrate how the orientation of a nanomagnet relative to the direction of an applied electrical current impacts the threshold current density needed for all-electrical magnetization switching, and how dipolar coupling between the nanomagnets influences the switching of interacting pairs and ensembles of nanomagnets. Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems. These results establish SOT switching as a practical method for programmable manipulation of dipolar nanomagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of an isolated flat band in the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersionless electronic bands lead to an extremely high density of states and suppressed kinetic energy, thereby increasing electronic correlations and instabilities that can shape emergent ordered states, such as excitonic, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases. A flat band that extends over the entire momentum space and is well isolated from other dispersive bands is, therefore, particularly interesting. Here, the band structure of the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$ is revealed by utilizing photoelectron momentum microscopy. We directly map out an electronic band that is flat throughout the entire Brillouin zone and features a width of only $\sim$100 meV. This band is well isolated from both the conduction and remote valence bands. Moreover, the quasiparticle band gap shows a high tunability upon the deposition of caesium atoms on the surface. By combining the single-particle band structure with the optical transmission spectrum, the optical gap is identified. The fully isolated flat band in a van der Waals crystal provides a qualitatively new testbed for exploring flat-band physics.</description>

By employing density functional theory (DFT) with an optimized local basis set, we simulate tBLG, obtaining fully relaxed commensurate structures for twist angles down to 0.987{\deg}. For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset. Additionally, we provide details of the low-energy wavefunction character, band inversion and symmetries. Our results provide an ab initio reference point for the microscopic structure and electronic properties of tBLG which will serve as the foundation for future studies incorporating many-body effects.</description>

Abstract: Magnetotactic bacteria synthesize linear chains of magnetite nanoparticles within their bodies, which allow the bacteria to navigate the Earth's magnetic field in search of the best habitat. Biogenic magnetite particles, called magnetosomes, are very promising for use in biomedicine. Magnetosome chains have also been found in ancient fossils and sediments. The study of magnetofossils provides valuable information about the Earth's biological past. The presence of biogenic magnetite in ancient rock samples can be detected by measuring ferromagnetic resonance spectra, first-order magnetization reversal curves, or quasi-static hysteresis loops. Theoretical analyses of these experiments generally assume that magnetosomes are spherical nanoparticles, although the shape of some types of magnetosomes is close to spheroidal one. In this work, simple formulas for describing the magneto-dipole interaction of oriented spheroids are obtained and quasi-static hysteresis loops of randomly oriented magnetosome chain assembly consisting of elongated spheroids are calculated.</description>

      <title>Interaction Induced Magnetotransport in a 2D Dirac-Heavy Hole Hybrid Band System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While electron-electron (e-e) interactions are known to influence resistivity in non-Galilean invariant two-dimensional (2D) systems, their effect on magnetotransport is not fully understood. Conventional models for simple bands often predict a vanishing magnetoresistivity from e-e interactions alone. In this work, we investigate magnetotransport in a gapless 6.3 nm HgTe quantum well, a hybrid 2D band system that hosts coexisting holes with both linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic energy bands. Focusing on the high temperature regime where particle-particle collisions dominate scattering, we observe significant corrections to both the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect. The high temperature transport coefficients are in good agreement with the theoretical model describing transport in massive-massless fermion mixtures governed by a frictional mechanism and intervalley scattering. Our findings provide strong experimental validation for this theoretical framework, demonstrating that collisions between particles with different dispersions are a key mechanism governing magnetotransport in hybrid band semimetals.</description>

      <title>Observation of polaritonic flat-band bound states in the continuum in a 2D magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band bound states in the continuum (BICs) are topological states with suppressed group velocity and robustness against radiation loss, offering a powerful platform for the exploration of non-Hermitian, nonlinear, topological phenomena and device applications. Van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising candidates for sustaining BICs and hybridizing with material transitions. However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band. Our findings underscore CrSBr as an exceptional platform for exploring flat-band photonics and polaritonics, paving the new avenue for advances in next-generation optical and quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states host fractionally charged anyons with exotic exchange statistics. Of particular interest are FQH phases supporting non-Abelian anyons, which can encode topologically protected quantum information. In this work, we construct quasihole bases for a broad family of non-Abelian FQH states using parton wave functions, which reproduces the fusion-space dimensionality expected from their underlying conformal field theory, consistent with level-rank duality across the parton family. As an application, we numerically compute braiding matrices for representative parton states for large systems, providing a general framework for diagnosing non-Abelian characteristics in candidate FQH states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the coupling between lattice vibrations and magnetic order is crucial for controlling properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we investigate the vibrational properties of bulk and thick-flake CrCl$_\textrm{3}$ using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, complemented by photoluminescence, photoluminescence excitation, and optical absorption measurements. Symmetry analysis, supported by first-principles phonon calculations, enables the unambiguous assignment of all eight Raman-active modes, four $\textrm{A}_\textrm{g}$ and four $\textrm{E}_\textrm{g}$, previously predicted only theoretically. Excitation-energy-dependent measurements reveal that the strong enhancement of selected phonon modes originates primarily from interference effects rather than resonant Raman scattering. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further reveals pronounced signatures of spin-phonon coupling across the transition from a fully antiferromagnetic phase, through an intermediate regime with local, domain-like ferromagnetic order, to the paramagnetic phase, accompanied by a clear rhombohedral-to-monoclinic structural transition. Together, these results demonstrate how lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom collectively govern the Raman response of CrCl$_\textrm{3}$.</description>

      <title>Tunable Edelstein effect in intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Edelstein effect, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and is therefore highly promising for future spintronic devices, can be realized and non-volatilely manipulated in ferroelectric materials owing to their broken inversion symmetry and switchable polarization states. To date, most ferroelectric systems reported to exhibit the Edelstein effect are semiconductors, requiring extrinsic doping for functionality. In contrast, the Edelstein effect has rarely been reported in metallic ferroelectric systems, where doping is unnecessary. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a pronounced Edelstein effect can be realized in the recently proposed intrinsic two-dimensional ferroelectric metal PtBi$_{2}$ monolayer, where the sign of the Edelstein coefficient is coupled to the direction of ferroelectric polarization through the polarization-switching-induced reversal of spin textures, thereby enabling non-volatile control of charge-spin conversion. The Edelstein effect reaches a magnitude of $10^{11}~\hbar/(\textup{A} \cdot \textup{cm})$, which is sizable compared to previously reported ferroelectric systems. Microscopically, the Edelstein effect in a PtBi$_2$ monolayer originates from competing contributions of inner Rashba-like electron pockets and outer hole pockets with opposite signs; an upward shift of the Fermi level alters their balance and can reverse the sign of the Edelstein effect. Upon applying biaxial strain, the Fermi-surface electronic structure is strongly modified, resulting in a pronounced change of the Edelstein effect: a 2 \% compressive strain suppresses the Edelstein effect by about 50 \%. Our results not only identify a promising material platform for tunable charge-spin conversion but also provide new insights into the functional potential of metallic ferroelectric systems.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83 mV of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the nonreciprocity of hydrodynamic electron transport in noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is significantly enhanced compared to the disorder-dominated regime. This enhancement is caused by the linear dependence of the viscosity of the electron liquid on the flow velocity, which is allowed in the absence of TRS and Galilean invariance. The resulting nonlinear flows break dynamical similarity and must be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds number and the emergent nonreciprocity number. The latter is linear in velocity but independent of system size. We determine the nonlinear conductance of a Hall bar and show that the nonreciprocal correction to the current can be of comparable magnitude to its reciprocal counterpart.</description>

Abstract: Silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising candidates for practical quantum computers because of their scalability and compatibility with the well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, the coherence time is limited in industry-standard natural silicon because of the $^{29}$Si isotopes, which have non-zero nuclear spin. Here, we protect an isotopically natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot spin qubit from environmental noise via electron spin resonance with a phase-modulated microwave (MW) drive. This concatenated continuous drive (CCD) method extends the decay time of Rabi oscillations from 1.2 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ to over 200 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. Furthermore, we define a protected qubit basis and propose robust gate operations. We find the coherence time measured by Ramsey sequence is improved from 143 ns to 40.7 $\mu$s compared to that of the bare spin qubit. The single qubit gate fidelity measured with randomized benchmarking is improved from 95% to 99%, underscoring the effectiveness of the CCD method. The method shows promise for improving control fidelity of noisy qubits, overcoming the qubit variability for global control, and maintaining qubit coherence while idling.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental demonstration of the quantum coherent phase slip and current quantization in the superconductors, the fundamental phenomena dual to the coherent Cooper pair tunnelling and voltage quantization (Shapiro steps), enables the development of a new quantum device, the Bloch transistor (BT). BT has a unique functionality: it can deliver quantized non-dissipative current to the quantum circuit. BT consists of two coupled Josephson Junctions (JJ) in the regime of coherent quantum phase slip. At the heart of the BT operation is a new mechanism for phase-locking the Bloch oscillations in JJs to microwaves via induced charge. The charge phase locking allows not only quantization of current but also gate voltage control of this quantisation through the Aharonov-Casher effect. We study the operation of the BT and analyse its parameters. BT technology is scalable and compatible with other superconducting quantum devices, making it part of an emerging cryogenic quantum technology platform</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and tunable Griffiths phase in superconducting twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT, where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states. Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Valley-dependent topological interface states in biased armchair nanoribbons of gapless single-layer graphene for transport applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valley-dependent topological physics offers a promising avenue for designing nanoscale devices based on gapless single-layer graphene. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate an electrical bias-controlled topological discontinuity in valley polarization within a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless single-layer graphene. This discontinuity is created at the interface by applying opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. An efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation is developed to calculate electron states in the structure. In a reference configuration, we obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions that feature interface-confined electron eigenstates induced by the topological discontinuity. Moreover, to elucidate the implications of interface confinement for electron transport, a modified configuration is introduced to transform the eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. We show that such states result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of these quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is examined with respect to fluctuations. Finally, a proof-of-concept band-stop electron energy filter is presented, highlighting the potential of this confinement mechanism and, more broadly, valley-dependent topological physics in designing nanoscale devices in gapless single-layer graphene.</description>

Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy-induced luminescence (STML) provides access to optical properties of individual molecules through a cascade of relaxation processes between many-body states. Insufficient charge attachment energies quench the relaxation cascade via optically excited states, causing even intrinsically bright molecules to remain dark in STML. Here, we leverage substrate work function control and tip-induced gating of the double barrier tunnel junction to induce an energy shift of the ionic transition state of a single free-base tetrabenzoporphyrin (H2TBP) to control access to optically excited states and bright exciton emission. The experimental observations are validated by a rate equation and polaron model considering the relaxation energy of the NaCl decoupling layer upon charging of the molecule.</description>

The underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations is presented. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, characterized by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. The emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Furthermore, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, such as fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunnelling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Concrete experimental pathways for realizing these effects in semiconductor heterostructures are proposed, and the framework is extended to multi-qubit entanglement generation with a quantitative analysis of its inherent resilience to decoherence. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials as a versatile and scalable platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Hysteretic Excitation in Non-collinear Antiferromagnetic Spin-Torque Oscillators: A Terminal Velocity Motion Perspective</title>

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin torque oscillators (NC-AFM STO) by unifying spin dynamics under the Poisson Bracket formalism. Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA).</description>

      <title>Hybrid III-V/Silicon Quantum Photonic Device Generating Broadband Entangled Photon Pairs</title>

Abstract: The demand for integrated photonic chips combining the generation and manipulation of quantum states of light is steadily increasing, driven by the need for compact and scalable platforms for quantum information technologies. While photonic circuits with diverse functionalities are being developed in different single material platforms, it has become crucial to realize hybrid photonic circuits that harness the advantages of multiple materials while mitigating their respective weaknesses, resulting in enhanced capabilities. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid III-V/Silicon quantum photonic device combining the strong second-order nonlinearity and direct bandgap of the III-V semiconductor platform with the high maturity and CMOS compatibility of the silicon photonic platform. Our device embeds the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) of photon pairs into an AlGaAs source and their vertical routing to an adhesively-bonded silicon-on-insulator circuitry, within an evanescent coupling scheme managing both polarization states. This enables the on-chip generation of broadband (&gt; 40 nm) telecom photons by type 0 and type 2 SPDC from the hybrid device, at room temperature and with internal pair generation rates exceeding $10^5$ $s^{-1}$ for both types, while the pump beam is strongly rejected. Two-photon interference with 92% visibility (and up to 99% upon 5 nm spectral filtering) proves the high energy-time entanglement quality of the produced quantum state, thereby enabling a wide range of quantum information applications on-chip, within an hybrid architecture compliant with electrical pumping and merging the assets of two mature and highly complementary platforms in view of out-of-the-lab deployment of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact Duality at Low Energy in a Josephson Tunnel Junction Coupled to a Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the low-energy behavior of a Josephson tunnel junction coupled to a finite-length, charge-biased transmission line and compare it to its flux-biased counterpart. For transmission lines of increasing length, we show that the low-energy charge-dependent energy bands of the charge-biased configuration can be exactly mapped onto those of the flux-biased system via a well-defined duality transformation of circuit parameters. In the limit of an infinitely long transmission line, the influence of boundary conditions vanishes, and both circuits reduce to a resistively shunted Josephson junction. This convergence reveals the system's intrinsic self-duality and critical behavior. Our exact formulation of charge-flux duality provides a foundation for generalizations to more complex superconductor-insulator phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave, high-resolution, ultra-broadband mid-infrared nonlinear spectroscopy with tunable plasmonic nanocavities</title>

Abstract: Vibrational sum- and difference-frequency generation (SFG and DFG) spectroscopy probes the nonlinear response of interfaces at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths while detecting upconverted signals in the visible. Recent work has moved from large-area films and colloids to nanoscale structures using dual-resonant plasmonic nanocavities that co-confine light and matter in deep-subwavelength volumes. Here we implement high-resolution ($&lt;1$~cm$^{-1}$), continuous-wave ultrabroadband vSFG, vDFG, and four-wave mixing (FWM) coherent spectroscopy from 860 to 1670~cm$^{-1}$ on dual-resonant antennas under ambient conditions. Using a commercial, broadly tunable quantum-cascade laser and eliminating geometric phase matching simplify acquisition and expand spectral reach. The resulting spectra exhibit coherent interference between resonant (vibrational) and nonresonant (electronic) contributions to the effective $\chi^{(2)}$, previously accessible only under fs/ps excitation. Simultaneous measurement of SFG and DFG enables a {ratiometric} analysis that suppresses common-mode drifts and helps reveal vibrational resonances. We demonstrate versatility and reproducibility across several analytes that span distinct relative strengths of vibrational vs. electronic nonlinearities. Together, these capabilities position our approach as a scalable route to multiplexed, high-resolution MIR sensing and a practical basis for chip-level, label-free coherent spectroscopy. It opens a feasible path toward single- and few-molecule optomechanical studies using nanoscale trapping strategies.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moir\'e physics with twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than with van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic-level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In interfaces between 2D materials and oxide membranes the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. When imaging stacked membranes in projection, we find conventional through-focal imaging to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography detects structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasize the need for reliable characterization methods, both in cross-section and projection.</description>
