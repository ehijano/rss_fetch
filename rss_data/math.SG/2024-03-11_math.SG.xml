      <title>Magnetic billiards and the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of disk tangent bundles of lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hofer-Zehnder capacity of disk tangent bundles of certain lens spaces with respect to the round metric. Interestingly we find that the Hofer-Zehnder capacity does not see the covering, i.e. the capacity of the disk tangent bundle of the lens space coincides with the capacity of the disk tangent bundle of the 3-sphere covering it. In particular, this gives a first example, where Gromov width and Hofer-Zehnder capacity of a disk tangent bundle disagree. Techniques we use include for the lower bound magnetic billiards and for the upper bound Gromov-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Moduli space theory for complete, constant Q-curvature metrics on finitely punctured spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study constant Q-curvature metrics conformal to the round metric on the sphere with finitely many point singularities. We show that the moduli space of solutions with finitely many punctures in fixed positions, equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff topology, has the local structure of a real analytic variety with formal dimension equal to the number of the punctures. If a nondegeneracy hypothesis holds, we show that a neighborhood in the moduli space is actually a real-analytic manifold of the expected dimension. We also construct a geometrically natural set of parameters, construct a symplectic structure on this parameter space and show that in the smooth case a small neighborhood of the moduli space embeds as a Lagrangian submanifold in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Strong closing property of contact forms and action selecting functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.09216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of strong closing property of contact forms, inspired by the $C^\infty$ closing lemma for Reeb flows in dimension three. We then prove a sufficient criterion for strong closing property, which is formulated by considering a monoidal functor from a category of manifolds with contact forms to a category of filtered vector spaces. As a potential application of this criterion, we propose a conjecture which says that a standard contact form on the boundary of any symplectic ellipsoid satisfies strong closing property.</description>

      <title>Quantum Steenrod operations of symplectic resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mod $p$ equivariant quantum cohomology of conical symplectic resolutions. Using symplectic genus zero enumerative geometry, Fukaya and Wilkins defined operations on mod $p$ quantum cohomology deforming the classical Steenrod operations on mod $p$ cohomology. We conjecture that these quantum Steenrod operations on divisor classes agree with the $p$-curvature of the mod $p$ equivariant quantum connection, and verify this in the case of the Springer resolution. The key ingredient is a new compatibility relation between the quantum Steenrod operations and the shift operators.</description>

      <title>Explicit formula of deformation quantization with separation of variables for complex two-dimensional locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complex two-dimensional noncommutative locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifold via a deformation quantization with separation of variables. We present an explicit formula of its star product by solving the system of recurrence relations given by Hara-Sako. In the two-dimensional case, this system of recurrence relations gives two types of equations corresponding to the two coordinates. From the two types of recurrence relations, symmetrized and antisymmetrized recurrence relations are obtained. The symmetrized one gives the solution of the recurrence relation. From the antisymmetrized one, the identities satisfied by the solution are obtained. The star products for $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ are constructed by the method obtained in this study, and we verify that these star products satisfy the identities.</description>

      <title>Null Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory: Soft symmetries and memory as superselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft symmetries for Yang-Mills theory are shown to correspond to the residual Hamiltonian action of the gauge group on the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space, which is the result of a partial symplectic reduction. The associated momentum map is the electromagnetic memory in the abelian theory, or a nonlinear, gauge-equivariant, generalization thereof in the nonabelian case.
  This result follows from an application of Hamiltonian reduction by stages, enabled by the existence of a natural normal subgroup of the gauge group on a null codimension-1 submanifold with boundaries. The first stage is coisotropic reduction of the Gauss constraint, and it yields a symplectic extension of the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space (up to a covering). Hamiltonian reduction of the residual gauge action leads to the fully-reduced phase space of the theory. This is a Poisson manifold, whose symplectic leaves, called superselection sectors, are labelled by the (gauge classes of the generalized) electric flux across the boundary.
  In this framework, the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space arises as an intermediate reduction stage that enforces the superselection of the electric flux at only one of the two boundary components. These results provide a natural, purely Hamiltonian, explanation of the existence of soft symmetries as a byproduct of partial symplectic reduction, as well as a motivation for the expected decomposition of the quantum Hilbert space of states into irreducible representations labelled by the Casimirs of the Poisson structure on the reduced phase space.</description>

      <title>The universal structure of moment maps in complex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric approach to the construction of moment maps in finite and infinite-dimensional complex geometry. We apply this to two settings: K\"ahler manifolds and holomorphic vector bundles. Our new approach exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant differential forms.
  For K\"ahler manifolds we give a new, geometric proof of Donaldson-Fujiki's moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature. Associated to arbitrary products of Chern classes of the manifold - namely to a central charge - we further introduce a geometric PDE determining a $Z$-critical K\"ahler metric, and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map properties. For holomorphic vector bundles, using a similar strategy we give a geometric proof of Atiyah-Bott's moment map interpretation of the Hermitian Yang-Mills condition. We then go on to give a new, geometric proof that the PDE determining a $Z$-critical connection - again associated to a choice of central charge - can be viewed as a moment map; deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections are a special case, in which our work gives a geometric proof of a result of Collins-Yau.
  Our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps in complex geometry - associated to any geometric problem along with a choice of stability condition - and hence that this accomplishes one of the main steps towards producing PDE counterparts to stability conditions in large generality.</description>
