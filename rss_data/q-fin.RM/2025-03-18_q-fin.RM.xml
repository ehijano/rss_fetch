      <title>Vote Delegation in DeFi Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the drivers of vote delegation in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), using the Uniswap governance DAO as a laboratory. We show that parties with fewer self-owned votes and those affiliated with the controlling venture capital firm, Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), receive more vote delegations. These patterns suggest that while the Uniswap ecosystem values decentralization, a16z may engage in window-dressing around it. Moreover, we find that an active and successful track record in submitting improvement proposals, especially in the final stage, leads to more vote delegations, indicating that delegation in DAOs is at least partly reputation- or merit-based. Combined, our findings provide new insights into how governance and decentralization operate in DeFi.</description>

      <title>Deep Hedging of Green PPAs in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In power markets, Green Power Purchase Agreements have become an important contractual tool of the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources such as wind or solar radiation. Trading Green PPAs exposes agents to price risks and weather risks. Also, developed electricity markets feature the so-called cannibalisation effect : large infeeds induce low prices and vice versa. As weather is a non-tradable entity the question arises how to hedge and risk-manage in this highly incom-plete setting. We propose a ''deep hedging'' framework utilising machine learning methods to construct hedging strategies. The resulting strategies outperform static and dynamic benchmark strategies with respect to different risk measures.</description>

      <title>Model-free Analysis of Dynamic Trading Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model-free approach for analyzing the risk and return for a broad class of dynamic trading strategies, including pairs trading, mean-reversion trading and other statistical arbitrage strategies, in terms of excursions of a trading signal away from a reference level. Our results are derived in a pathwise setting, without any probabilistic assumptions.
  We introduce the notion of {\delta}-excursion, defined as a path which deviates by {\delta} from a reference level before returning to this level. We show that every continuous path has a unique decomposition into {\delta}-excursions. This decomposition is useful for the scenario analysis of dynamic trading strategies, leading to simple expressions for the number of trades, realized profit, maximum loss, and drawdown. We show that the high-frequency limit of mean-reversion strategies may be described in terms of the (p-th order) local time of the signal. In particular, our results yield a financial interpretation of the local time of an irregular path. Finally, we describe a non-parametric scenario simulation method for generating paths whose excursion properties match those observed in empirical data.</description>
