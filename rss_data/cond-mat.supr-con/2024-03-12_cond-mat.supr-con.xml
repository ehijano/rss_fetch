      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an s-wave superconductor coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems, e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed device.</description>

      <title>Pressure effects on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates RNiO$_2$ (R= rare-earth), and the subsequent enhancement of their T$_c$ with pressure, we investigate the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this family of materials via first-principles calculations employing hydrostatic and chemical pressure as tuning knobs. Overall, our analysis shows that pressure tends to increase the R-$5d$ self-doping effect, as well as the Ni-$d _{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bandwidth, the $e_g$ energy splitting, the charge transfer energy, and the superexchange ($J$). Using the energy scale of $J$ as a predictor of superconducting tendencies, we anticipate that pressure can indeed be a feasible means to further increase the T$_c$ in this family of materials.</description>

      <title>Modelling response time contrasts in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detector (SNSPD) emerges as a potential candidate in the multiple fields requiring sensitive and fast photodetection. While nanowires of low temperature superconducting detectors are mature with commercial solutions, other material options with higher transition temperature and faster responses are currently being explored. Towards this goal, we develop a generalized numerical model that incorporates the thermodynamic properties of the superconducting material and identifies the minimum resolvable photon count for a given bias and device parameters. A phase diagram of detection and latching phases with the minimum number of photons as a function of biasing current and biasing temperature for each material system is presented. We show using the developed model that while low temperature superconducting (LTS) nanowires are more sensitive to the incident photon at different wavelengths, the ultimate limit of a single photon can be achieved using high temperature superconducting (HTS) material such as YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta}, albeit at stringent biasing conditions. On the contrary, ultrafast response time with three orders of magnitude smaller response times can be achieved in select HTS materials making it an appealing for several practical applications.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Superconducting Infinite-Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the momentum-resolved electronic structure of infinite-layer nickelates is essential for understanding this new class of unconventional superconductors, but has been hindered by the formidable challenges in improving the sample quality. In this work, we report for the first time the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of superconducting La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_{2}$ films prepared by molecular beam epitaxy and ${\mathrm{\textit{in situ}}}$ atomic-hydrogen reduction. The measured Fermi topology closely matches theoretical calculations, showing a large Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived Fermi sheet that evolves from hole-like to electron-like along $k_{z}$, and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket centered at Brillouin zone corner. The Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived bands show a mass enhancement ($m^*/m_{\rm{DFT}}$) of 2-3,while the 3D electron band shows negligible band renormalization. Moreover, the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ derived states also display a band dispersion anomaly at higher binding energy, reminiscent of the waterfall feature and kinks observed in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Superconducting switching jump induced missing first Shapiro step in Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of odd-order Shapiro steps is one of the predicted signatures for topological superconductors. Experimentally, the missing first-order Shapiro step has been reported in several superconducting systems presumably to be topologically non-trivial, as well as in the topologically trivial regime of superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. In this work, we revisit the missing first Shapiro step signature in the topologically trivial regime of Al-InSb nanosheet Josephson junctions under microwave irradiation. The missing first Shapiro step is found to be accompanied by a sharp voltage jump during the superconducting switching and reappears when the jump is softened by increasing temperature or magnetic field. The missing first Shapiro step also reappears with an increased microwave frequency. The sharp switching jump, existing without microwave irradiation, deviates from the relation given by the standard resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. Missing Shapiro step signatures are qualitatively captured by introducing the sharp voltage jump into the RSJ model. This work reveals a common, yet overlooked, phenomenon that leads to the missing first Shapiro step, providing a new perspective on fractional Josephson experiments.</description>

      <title>Cuprate-like Electronic Structures in Infinite-Layer Nickelates with 3D dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in the infinite-layer (IL) nickelates provides a new platform and angle of view to study the long-standing problem of high temperature superconductivity . Many models were proposed to understand its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here, we fill this gap by preparing IL LaNiO$_2$ and La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ thin films with superior surface quality and measuring their electronic structure by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).The Fermi surface consists of a large three-dimensional hole pocket primarily contributed by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and a small electron pocket at the Brillouin zone (BZ) corner. The hole pocket exhibits a two-dimensional character over approximately 80% of the Brillouin zone, and its Fermi surface topology and band dispersion closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates, suggesting their superconducting mechanisms may be alike. Yet this hole pocket shows strong three-dimensional character near $k_z=\pi$, which deviates from previous calculations and adds new facets to the superconductivity in IL nickelates. The experimental electronic structure represents a pivotal step toward a microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional phase diagram of the charge density wave in doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb and Cs) have attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders. Among them, the charge density wave (CDW) order has been shown to host various unconventional behaviors. Here, we investigate the CDW order by a combination of both bulk and surface doping methods. While element substitutions in bulk doping change both carriers and the crystal lattice, the surface doping primarily tunes the carrier concentration. As such, our results reveal a two-dimensional phase diagram of the CDW in doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. In the lightly bulk doped regime, the existence of CDW order is reversible by tuning the carrier concentration. But excessive bulk doping permanently destroys the CDW, regardless of the carrier doping level. These results provide insights to the origin of the CDW from both electronic and structural degrees of freedom. They also open an avenue for manipulating the exotic CDW order in Kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Universal Chemical Formula Dependence of $Ab$ $Initio$ Low-Energy Effective Hamiltonian in Single-Layer Carrier Doped Cuprate Superconductors -- Study by Hierarchical Dependence Extraction Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to control the superconducting (SC) transition temperature at optimal hole doping $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ in cuprates by tuning the chemical formula (CF). $T_{c}^{\rm opt}$ can be theoretically predicted from the parameters of the \textit{ab initio} low-energy effective Hamiltonian (LEH) with one antibonding (AB) Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$/O$2p_{\sigma}$ orbital per Cu atom in the CuO$_2$ plane, notably the nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $|t_1|$ and the ratio $u=U/|t_1|$, where $U$ is the onsite effective Coulomb repulsion. However, the CF dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ is a highly nontrivial question. In this paper, we propose the universal dependence of $|t_1|$ and $u$ on the CF and structural features in hole doped cuprates with a single CuO$_2$ layer sandwiched between block layers. To do so, we perform extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations of $|t_1|$ and $u$ and analyze the results by employing a machine learning method called Hierarchical Dependence Extraction (HDE). The main results are the following: (a) $|t_1|$ has a main-order dependence on the radii $R_{\rm X}$ and $R_{\rm A}$ of the apical anion X and cation A in the block layer. ($|t_1|$ increases when $R_{\rm X}$ or $R_{\rm A}$ decreases.) (b) $u$ has a main-order dependence on the negative ionic charge $Z_{\rm X}$ of X and the hole doping $\delta$ of the AB orbital. ($u$ decreases when $|Z_{\rm X}|$ increases or $\delta$ increases.) We elucidate and discuss the microscopic mechanism of (a,b). We demonstrate the predictive power of the HDE by showing the consistency between (a,b) and results from previous works. The present results provide a basis for optimizing SC properties in cuprates and possibly akin materials. Also, the HDE method offers a general platform to identify dependencies between physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Molecularity: a fast and efficient criterion for probing superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient criterion for probing the critical temperature of hydrogen based superconductors. We start by expanding the applicability of 3D descriptors of electron localization to superconducting states within the framework of superconducting DFT. We first apply this descriptor to a model system, the hydrogen chain, which allows to prove two main concepts: i) that the electron localization changes very little when the transition from the normal to the superconducting state takes place, i.e. that it can be described at the DFT level from the normal state; and ii) that the formation of molecules can be characterized within this theoretical framework, enabling to filter out systems with marked molecular character and hence with low potential to be good superconductors. These two ideas, are then exploited in real binary and ternary systems, showing i) that the bonding type can be characterized automatically; and ii) that this provides a new index which enables to feed machine learning algorithms for a better prediction of critical temperatures. Overall, this sets a grounded theoretical scenario for an automatic and efficient high-throughput of potential hydrogen based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Holistic numerical simulation of a quenching process on a real-size multifilamentary superconducting coil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors play a crucial role in the advancement of high-field electromagnets. Unfortunately, their performance can be compromised by thermomagnetic instabilities, wherein the interplay of rapid magnetic and slow heat diffusion can result in catastrophic flux jumps eventually leading to irreversible damage. This issue has long plagued high-$J_c$ Nb$_3$Sn wires at the core of high-field magnets. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking large-scale GPU-optimized algorithm aimed at tackling the complex intertwined effects of electromagnetism, heating, and strain acting concomitantly during the quenching process of superconducting coils. We validate our model by conducting comparisons with magnetization measurements obtained from short multifilamentary Nb$_3$Sn wires and further experimental tests conducted on solenoid coils while subject to ramping transport currents. Furthermore, leveraging our developed numerical algorithm, we unveil the dynamic propagation mechanisms underlying thermomagnetic instabilities (including flux jumps and quenches) within the coils. Remarkably, our findings reveal that the velocity field of flux jumps and quenches within the coil is correlated with the amount of Joule heating experienced by each wire over a specific time interval, rather than solely being dependent on instantaneous Joule heating or maximum temperature. These insights have the potential to pave the way for optimizing the design of next-generation superconducting magnets, thereby directly influencing a wide array of technologically relevant and multidisciplinary applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetic flux via junction twist-angle in a triplet-superconducting transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits with strong anharmonicity and insensitivity to offset charge are highly desirable for low-error implementation. In this work we propose a c-axis junction, comprising triplet superconductors, and set at a relative twist angle. Invoking spin-orbit coupling and spin polarization, which are known to occur in the material platform of choice, we examine the resulting transmon Hamiltonian. This junction allows for direct control of the single and double Cooper pair tunneling strength, and most remarkably, an anomalous magnetic flux -- i.e. a phase offset equivalent to magnetic flux, yet in zero magnetic field. Having control over these three parameters -- single and double pair tunneling and anomalous flux -- allows for optimal design of the transmon qubit. Interestingly, in this architecture, the anomalous flux is determined by the twist angle of the junction, thereby offering a novel zero-field functionality. Our key results rely on symmetry arguments, for concreteness we demonstrate the implementation of our concept using a model of moir\'e graphene-based c-axis junctions.</description>

      <title>A compact approach to higher-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering detection using photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of inelastically scattered soft X-rays with high energy resolution usually requires large grating spectrometers. Recently, photoelectron spectrometry for analysis of X-rays (PAX) has been rediscovered for modern spectroscopy experiments at synchrotron light sources. By converting scattered photons to electrons and using an electron energy analyser, the energy resolution for resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) becomes decoupled from the X-ray spot size and instrument length. In this work, we develop PAX towards high energy resolution using a modern photoemission spectroscopy setup studying Ba2Cu3O4Cl2 at the Cu L3-edge. We measure a momentum transfer range of 24% of the first Brillouin zone simultaneously. Our results hint at the observation of a magnon excitation below 100 meV energy transfer and show intensity variations related to the dispersion of dd-excitations. With dedicated setups, PAX can become an alternative to the best and largest RIXS instruments, while at the same time opening new opportunities to acquire RIXS at a range of momentum transfers simultaneously and combine it with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a single instrument.</description>

      <title>Electronic and dynamical properties of cobalt monogermanide CoGe phases under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the pressure dependence of the electronic and dynamical properties of six different CoGe phases: orthorhombic Cmmm, hexagonal P6/mmm and P$\bar{6}$2m, monoclinic C2/m, cubic P2$_{1}$3, and orthorhombic Pnma. Using first-principles DFT calculations and the direct force-constants method, we study the dynamical stability of individual phases under external pressure. We show that the orthorombic Cmmm and hexagonal P6/mmm structures are unstable over a broad pressure range and most pronounced imaginary phonon soft mode in both cases leads to a stable hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m structure of the lowest ground-state energy of all studied phases at ambient and low (below $\sim 3$ GPa) external pressure. Under these conditions, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase has the highest energy, however, together with monoclinic C2/m and orthorombic Pnma it is dynamically stable and all these three structures can potentially coexist as meta-stable phases. Above $\sim 3$ GPa, the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase becomes the most energetically favorable. Fitting the Birch--Murnaghan equation of state we derive bulk modulus for all mentioned phases, which indicate relatively high resistance of CoGe to compression. Such conclusions are confirmed by band structure calculations. Additionally, we show that electronic bands of the hexagonal P$\bar{6}$2m phase reveal characteristic features of the kagome-like structure, while in the cubic P2$_{1}$3 phase spectrum, one can locate spin-1 and double Weyl fermions. In both cases, the external pressure induces the Lifshitz transition, related to the modification of the Fermi surface topology.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced Ferromagnetic and Superconducting Orders in Multi-orbital Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for hidden orders in photoexcited lattice systems is an active research field driven by experimental reports of light-induced or light-stabilized phases. In this study, we investigate hidden electronic orders in strongly correlated two-orbital Hubbard models with orbital-dependent bandwidths. In equilibrium, the half-filled systems are antiferromagnetically ordered. Using non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory we demonstrate the appearance of nonthermal ferromagnetic order in the photo-doped state, if the two bandwidths are sufficiently different, and its coexistence with spin-singlet $\eta$-superconductivity in the high photo-doping region. Spin-triplet $\eta$-superconducting order appears instead if the two bandwidths are comparable. The rich nonequilibrium phasediagram uncovered in this work shows that Mott insulating multi-orbital systems provide an interesting platform for the realization of nonthermal electronic orders.</description>

      <title>Gapless neutron superfluidity can explain the late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current interpretation of the observed late time cooling of transiently accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries during quiescence requires the suppression of neutron superfluidity in their crust at variance with recent ab initio many-body calculations of dense matter. Focusing on the two emblematic sources KS~1731$-$260 and MXB~1659$-$29, we show that their thermal evolution can be naturally explained by considering the existence of a neutron superflow driven by the pinning of quantized vortices. Under such circumstances, we find that the neutron superfluid can be in a gapless state in which the specific heat is dramatically increased compared to that in the classical BCS state assumed so far, thus delaying the thermal relaxation of the crust. We have performed neutron-star cooling simulations taking into account gapless superfluidity and we have obtained excellent fits to the data thus reconciling astrophysical observations with microscopic theories. The imprint of gapless superfluidity on other observable phenomena is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Tomasch Oscillations as Above-Gap Signature of Topological Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of topological superconductors usually involves searching for in-gap modes that are protected by topology. However, in the current experimental settings, the smoking-gun evidence of these in-gap modes is still lacking. In this work, we propose to distinguish between two-dimensional conventional s-wave and topological p-wave superconductors by above-gap transport signatures. Our method utilizes the emergence of Tomasch oscillations of quasiparticles in a junction consisting of a superconductor sandwiched between two metallic leads. We demonstrate that the behavior of the oscillations in conductance as a function of the interface barriers provides a distinctive signature for s-wave and p-wave superconductors. Specifically, the oscillations become weaker as the barrier strength increases in s-wave superconductors, while they become more pronounced in p-wave superconductors, which we prove to be a direct manifestation of the pairing symmetries. Our method opens a new route for identifying topological superconductors through above-gap transport.</description>

Abstract: We show the appearance of an unconventional Majorana zero mode whose wave function splits into multiple parts located at different ends of different topological superconductors, hereinafter referred to as a multi-locational Majorana zero mode. Specifically, we discuss the multi-locational Majorana zero modes in a three-terminal Josephson junction consisting of topological superconductors, which forms an elemental qubit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computers. We also demonstrate anomalously long-ranged nonlocal resonant transport phenomena caused by the multi-locational Majorana zero mode.</description>

      <title>Non-local transport measurements in hybrid quantum Hall - superconducting devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in hybrid quantum Hall (QH) superconductor devices, driven by the prospect to realize exotic ground states and excitations with non-abelian exchange statistics. While the existing experiments clearly demonstrate Andreev coupling between the edge states and the superconductors, the question remains whether the quantum coherence could propagate between several superconducting contacts via chiral channels. To answer this question, we have first extended the Landauer-B\"uttiker (LB) formalism to samples with one superconducting contact and found a remarkable agreement within a series of measurements related to each other via LB-type formulae. We have then switched to the case of multiple superconducting contacts, and found that we can describe the measurements self-consistently if we neglect the superconducting phase coherence between multiple contacts. We interpret this result as a negative answer to the question posed above: the phase correlations between multiple superconducting contacts are not established via micron-long quantum Hall edge states. Looking forward, our approach may find applications in the broader field of topological superconductivity and proximal structures. Possible violations of the self-consistency tests presented here may be used as an indication that superconducting phase coherence is induced in the quantum Hall edges.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nickelate superconductors have attracted a great deal of attention over the past few decades due to their similar crystal and electronic structures with high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we report the superconductivity in a pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper phase single crystal, La4Ni3O10 (n = 3), and its interplay with the density wave order in the phase diagram. With increasing pressure, the density wave order as indicated by the anomaly in the resistivity is progressively suppressed, followed by the emergence of the superconductivity around 25 K. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that the electronic structure of La4Ni3O10 is very similar to that of La3Ni2O7, suggesting unified electronic properties of nickelates in Ruddlesden-Popper phases. Moreover, theoretical analysis unveils that antiferromagnetic (AFM) super-exchange interactions can serve as the effective pairing interaction for the emergence of superconductivity (SC) in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Our research provides a new platform for the investigation of the unconventional superconductivity mechanism in Ruddlesden-Popper trilayer perovskite nickelates.</description>

      <title>Integrable-to-Thermalizing Crossover in Non-Equilibrium Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the experiment by M. Budden {\em et al.} [Nature Physics {\bf 17}, 611 (2021)], who observed signatures of long-lived photo-induced superconductivity, we develop an accurate analytical/computational approach to non-equilibrium superconductivity following a quench. We consider the BCS-Holstein model, which includes both integrable local electron-electron interactions and integrability-breaking electron-phonon coupling. We develop Keldysh-Eliashberg theory on the Kadanoff-Baym contour, which enables us to describe non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconductor. We consider a quench in interactions, which results in a dynamic transition from the initial superconducting state to a normal thermal state in the end of the evolution. It is shown that the dynamics contain two stages: The early-time integrable behavior, involving coherent oscillations of the superconducting order parameter, crosses over to the late-time ergodic dynamics exhibiting a thermal decay into an equilibrium state. In the former regime, our computational approach both reproduces exact analytical results on the integrable dynamics of the order parameter and generalizes those to the case of an initial thermal state. The method also succeeds for the first time in describing both integrable-to-thermalizing crossover and the late-time thermal decay, which is shown to be consistent with the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory (with the exponential decay time dependent on the density of quasiparticle excitations). We observe the electron distribution function approaching the Fermi-Dirac thermal distribution at final stages. The details of two-time non-equilibrium dynamics depend on the density of quasiparticles in the initial state and the integrability-breaking parameters, which under certain conditions may result in a long-lived transient superconductivity consistent with experiment.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type superconducting state in a voltage-driven superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a voltage-biased normal metal-superconductor-normal metal (N-S-N) junction. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function technique, we derive a quantum kinetic equation, to determine the superconducting order parameter self-consistently. The derived equation is an integral-differential equation with memory effects. We solve this equation by converting it into a system of ordinary differential equations with the use of a pole expansion of the Fermi-Dirac function. When the applied voltage exceeds the critical value, the superconductor switches to the normal state. We find that when the voltage is decreased from the normal phase, the system relaxes to a Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)-type inhomogeneous superconducting state, even in the absence of a magnetic Zeeman field. We point out that the emergence of the LO-type state can be attributed to the nonequilibrium energy distribution of electrons due to the bias voltage. We also point out that the system exhibits bistability, which leads to hysteresis in the voltage-current characteristic of the N-S-N junction.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the Fibonacci Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity was recently reported in several quasicrystalline systems. These are materials which are structurally ordered, but since they are not translationally invariant, the usual BCS theory does not apply. At the present time, the underlying mechanism and the properties of the superconducting phase are insufficiently understood. To gain a better understanding of quasiperiodic superconductors, we consider the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci chain, and examine its low-temperature superconducting phase in detail using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We obtain superconducting solutions as a function of the parameters controlling the physical properties of the system: the strength of the Hubbard attraction $U$, the chemical potential $\mu$, and the strength of the modulation of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, $w$. We find that there is a bulk transition at a critical temperature that obeys a power law in $U$. The local superconducting order parameter is self-similar both in real and perpendicular space. The local densities of states vary from site to site, however, the width of the superconducting gap is the same on all sites. The interplay between the Hubbard attraction and the intrinsic gaps of the Fibonacci chain results in a complex zero-temperature $\mu$-$U$ phase diagram with insulating domes surrounded by superconducting regions. Finally, we show that tuning $w$ from weak to strong quasicrystalline modulation gives rise to qualitatively different thermodynamic behaviors as could be observed by measuring the specific heat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a powerful technique for measuring the full elastic tensor of a given material in a single experiment. Previously, this technique was limited to regularly-shaped samples such as rectangular parallelepipeds, spheres, and cylinders. We demonstrate a new method for determining the elastic moduli of irregularly-shaped samples, extending the applicability of RUS to a much larger set of materials. We apply this new approach to the recently-discovered unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$ and provide its elastic tensor at both 300 and 4 kelvin.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity by Engineering Noncollinear Magnetism in Magnet/ Superconductor Heterostructures: A Realistic Prescription for 2D Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a realistic and rather general scheme where noncollinear magnetic textures proximitized with the most common $s$-wave superconductor can appear as the alternative to $p$-wave superconductor{--}the prime proposal to realize two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev model for topological superconductors (TSCs) hosting Majorana flat edge mode (MFEM). A general minimal Hamiltonian suitable for magnet/superconductor heterostructures reveals robust MFEM within the gap of Shiba bands due to the emergence of an effective ``$p_x+p_y$"-type $p$-wave pairing, spatially localized at the edges of a 2D magnetic domain of spin-spiral. We finally verify this concept by considering Mn (Cr) monolayer grown on a $s$-wave superconducting substrate, Nb(110) under strain (Nb(001)). In both 2D cases, the antiferromagnetic spin-spiral solutions exhibit robust MFEM at certain domain edges that is beyond the scope of the trivial extension of 1D spin-chain model in 2D. This approach, particularly when the MFEM appears in the TSC phase for such heterostructure materials, offers a perspective to extend the realm of the TSC in 2D.</description>

      <title>Superconducting triangular islands as a platform for manipulating Majorana zero modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current proposals for topological quantum computation (TQC) based on Majorana zero modes (MZM) have mostly been focused on coupled-wire architecture which can be challenging to implement experimentally. To explore alternative building blocks of TQC, in this work we study the possibility of obtaining robust MZM at the corners of triangular superconducting islands, which often appear spontaneously in epitaxial growth. We first show that a minimal three-site triangle model of spinless $p$-wave superconductor allows MZM to appear at different pairs of vertices controlled by a staggered vector potential, which may be realized using coupled quantum dots and can already demonstrate braiding. For systems with less fine-tuned parameters, we suggest an alternative structure of a "hollow" triangle subject to uniform supercurrents or vector potentials, in which MZM generally appear when two of the edges are in a different topological phase from the third. We also discuss the feasibility of constructing the triangles using existing candidate MZM systems and of braiding more MZM in networks of such triangles.</description>
