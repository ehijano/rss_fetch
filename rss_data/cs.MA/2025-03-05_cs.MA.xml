      <title>MultiAgentBench: Evaluating the Collaboration and Competition of LLM agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities as autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks either focus on single-agent tasks or are confined to narrow domains, failing to capture the dynamics of multi-agent coordination and competition. In this paper, we introduce MultiAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across diverse, interactive scenarios. Our framework measures not only task completion but also the quality of collaboration and competition using novel, milestone-based key performance indicators. Moreover, we evaluate various coordination protocols (including star, chain, tree, and graph topologies) and innovative strategies such as group discussion and cognitive planning. Notably, gpt-4o-mini reaches the average highest task score, graph structure performs the best among coordination protocols in the research scenario, and cognitive planning improves milestone achievement rates by 3%. Code and datasets are public available at https://github.com/MultiagentBench/MARBLE.</description>

      <title>Interactive Debugging and Steering of Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully autonomous teams of LLM-powered AI agents are emerging that collaborate to perform complex tasks for users. What challenges do developers face when trying to build and debug these AI agent teams? In formative interviews with five AI agent developers, we identify core challenges: difficulty reviewing long agent conversations to localize errors, lack of support in current tools for interactive debugging, and the need for tool support to iterate on agent configuration. Based on these needs, we developed an interactive multi-agent debugging tool, AGDebugger, with a UI for browsing and sending messages, the ability to edit and reset prior agent messages, and an overview visualization for navigating complex message histories. In a two-part user study with 14 participants, we identify common user strategies for steering agents and highlight the importance of interactive message resets for debugging. Our studies deepen understanding of interfaces for debugging increasingly important agentic workflows.</description>

      <title>$\text{M}^3\text{HF}$: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality ($\text{M}^3\text{HF}$), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weight by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Traffic Signal Control based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Case Study on a simulated real-world corridor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very few studies that have attempted to formulate multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for adaptive traffic signal control have mainly used value-based RL methods although recent literature has shown that policy-based methods may perform better in partially observable environments. Additionally, because of the simplifying assumptions on signal timing made almost universally across previous studies, RL methods remain largely untested for real-world signal timing plans. This study formulates a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MA-PPO) algorithm to implement adaptive and coordinated traffic control along an arterial corridor. The formulated MA-PPO has centralized critic architecture under the centralized training and decentralized execution framework. All agents are formulated to allow selection and implementation of up to eight signal phases as commonly implemented in the field controllers. The formulated algorithm is tested on a simulated real-world corridor with seven intersections, actual/complete traffic movements and signal phases, traffic volumes, and network geometry including intersection spacings. The performance of the formulated MA-PPO adaptive control algorithm is compared with the field implemented coordinated and actuated signal control (ASC) plans modeled using Vissim-MaxTime software in the loop simulation (SILs). The speed of convergence for each agent largely depended on the size of the action space which in turn depended on the number and sequence of signal phases. Compared with the currently implemented ASC signal timings, MA-PPO showed a travel time reduction of about 14% and 29%, respectively for the two through movements across the entire test corridor. Through volume sensitivity experiments, the formulated MA-PPO showed good stability, robustness and adaptability to changes in traffic demand.</description>

      <title>ReSo: A Reward-driven Self-organizing LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models in complex problem-solving. However, current MAS frameworks are limited by poor flexibility and scalability, with underdeveloped optimization strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ReSo, which integrates task graph generation with a reward-driven two-stage agent selection process. The core of ReSo is the proposed Collaborative Reward Model, which can provide fine-grained reward signals for MAS cooperation for optimization. We also introduce an automated data synthesis framework for generating MAS benchmarks, without human annotations. Experimentally, ReSo matches or outperforms existing methods. ReSo achieves \textbf{33.7\%} and \textbf{32.3\%} accuracy on Math-MAS and SciBench-MAS SciBench, while other methods completely fail.

Abstract: This paper presents our ongoing work toward developing an enterprise-ready Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA) system. Our research highlights the evolutionary nature of building agentic systems suitable for enterprise environments. By integrating state-of-the-art agentic AI techniques with a systematic approach to iterative evaluation, analysis, and refinement, we have achieved rapid and cost-effective performance gains, notably reaching a new state-of-the-art performance on the WebArena benchmark. We detail our development roadmap, the methodology and tools that facilitated rapid learning from failures and continuous system refinement, and discuss key lessons learned and future challenges for enterprise adoption.</description>

      <title>Online Fair Division: Towards Ex-Post Constant MMS Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of fairly allocating $m$ indivisible items among $n$ sequentially arriving agents with additive valuations, under the sought-after fairness notion of maximin share (MMS). We first observe a strong impossibility: without appropriate knowledge about the valuation functions of the incoming agents, no online algorithm can ensure any non-trivial MMS approximation, even when there are only two agents. Motivated by this impossibility, we introduce OnlineKTypeFD (online $k$-type fair division), a model that balances theoretical tractability with real-world applicability. In this model, each arriving agent belongs to one of $k$ types, with all agents of a given type sharing the same known valuation function. We do not constrain $k$ to be a constant. Upon arrival, an agent reveals her type, receives an irrevocable allocation, and departs. We study the ex-post MMS guarantees of online algorithms under two arrival models:
  1- Adversarial arrivals: In this model, an adversary determines the type of each arriving agent. We design a $\frac{1}{k}$-MMS competitive algorithm and complement it with a lower bound, ruling out any $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$-MMS-competitive algorithm, even for binary valuations.
  2- Stochastic arrivals: In this model, the type of each arriving agent is independently drawn from an underlying, possibly unknown distribution. Unlike the adversarial setting where the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable, we surprisingly show that in the stochastic setting, an asymptotic, arbitrarily close-to-$\frac{1}{2}$-MMS competitive guarantee is achievable under mild distributional assumptions.
  Our results extend naturally to a learning-augmented framework; when given access to predictions about valuation functions, we show that the competitive ratios of our algorithms degrade gracefully with multiplicative prediction errors.</description>

      <title>Improved MMS Approximations for Few Agent Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fair division of indivisible goods under the maximin share (MMS) fairness criterion in settings where agents are grouped into a small number of types, with agents within each type having identical valuations. For the special case of a single type, an exact MMS allocation is always guaranteed to exist. However, for two or more distinct agent types, exact MMS allocations do not always exist, shifting the focus to establishing the existence of approximate-MMS allocations. A series of works over the last decade has resulted in the best-known approximation guarantee of $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{3836}$.
  In this paper, we improve the approximation guarantees for settings where agents are grouped into two or three types, a scenario that arises in many practical settings. Specifically, we present novel algorithms that guarantee a $\frac{4}{5}$-MMS allocation for two agent types and a $\frac{16}{21}$-MMS allocation for three agent types. Our approach leverages the MMS partition of the majority type and adapts it to provide improved fairness guarantees for all types.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Fact Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the problem of fake news detection using distributed fact-checkers (agents) with unknown reliability. The stream of news/statements is modeled as an independent and identically distributed binary source (to represent true and false statements). Upon observing a news, agent $i$ labels the news as true or false which reflects the true validity of the statement with some probability $1-\pi_i$. In other words, agent $i$ misclassified each statement with error probability $\pi_i\in (0,1)$, where the parameter $\pi_i$ models the (un)trustworthiness of agent $i$. We present an algorithm to learn the unreliability parameters, resulting in a distributed fact-checking algorithm. Furthermore, we extensively analyze the discrete-time limit of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Inversion Paradox and Ranking Methods in Tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with ranking methods. We study the situation where a tournament between $n$ players $P_1$, $P_2$, \ldots $P_n$ gives the ranking $P_1 \succ P_2 \succ \cdots \succ P_n$, but, if the results of $P_n$ are no longer taken into account (for example $P_n$ is suspended for doping), then the ranking becomes $P_{n-1} \succ P_{n-2} \succ \cdots \succ P_2 \succ P_1$. If such a situation arises, we call it an inversion paradox. In this article, we give a sufficient condition for the inversion paradox to occur. More precisely, we give an impossibility theorem. We prove that if a ranking method satisfies three reasonable properties (the ranking must be natural, reducible by Condorcet tournaments and satisfies the long tournament property) then we cannot avoid the inversion paradox, i.e., there are tournaments where the inversion paradox occurs. We then show that this paradox can occur when we use classical methods, e.g., Borda, Massey, Colley and Markov methods.</description>

      <title>BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</description>

      <title>LTL Verification of Memoryful Neural Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for verifying Memoryful Neural Multi-Agent Systems (MN-MAS) against full Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specifications. In MN-MAS, agents interact with a non-deterministic, partially observable environment. Examples of MN-MAS include multi-agent systems based on feed-forward and recurrent neural networks or state-space models. Different from previous approaches, we support the verification of both bounded and unbounded LTL specifications. We leverage well-established bounded model checking techniques, including lasso search and invariant synthesis, to reduce the verification problem to that of constraint solving. To solve these constraints, we develop efficient methods based on bound propagation, mixed-integer linear programming, and adaptive splitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms in single and multi-agent environments from the Gymnasium and PettingZoo libraries, verifying unbounded specifications for the first time and improving the verification time for bounded specifications by an order of magnitude compared to the SoA.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Resilience Modeling for Autonomous Cyber Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber resilience is the ability of a system to recover from an attack with minimal impact on system operations. However, characterizing a network's resilience under a cyber attack is challenging, as there are no formal definitions of resilience applicable to diverse network topologies and attack patterns. In this work, we propose a quantifiable formulation of resilience that considers multiple defender operational goals, the criticality of various network resources for daily operations, and provides interpretability to security operators about their system's resilience under attack. We evaluate our approach within the CybORG environment, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous cyber defense, analyzing trade-offs between resilience, costs, and prioritization of operational goals. Furthermore, we introduce methods to aggregate resilience metrics across time-variable attack patterns and multiple network topologies, comprehensively characterizing system resilience. Using insights gained from our resilience metrics, we design RL autonomous defensive agents and compare them against several heuristic baselines, showing that proactive network hardening techniques and prompt recovery of compromised machines are critical for effective cyber defenses.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Residential Load Scheduling under Data Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a data-driven approach, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made remarkable advances in solving cooperative residential load scheduling problems. However, centralized training, the most common paradigm for MARL, limits large-scale deployment in communication-constrained cloud-edge environments. As a remedy, distributed training shows unparalleled advantages in real-world applications but still faces challenge with system scalability, e.g., the high cost of communication overhead during coordinating individual agents, and needs to comply with data governance in terms of privacy. In this work, we propose a novel MARL solution to address these two practical issues. Our proposed approach is based on actor-critic methods, where the global critic is a learned function of individual critics computed solely based on local observations of households. This scheme preserves household privacy completely and significantly reduces communication cost. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art actor-critic framework without data governance and communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Converging to Stability in Two-Sided Bandits: The Case of Unknown Preferences on Both Sides of a Matching Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of repeated two-sided matching with uncertain preferences (two-sided bandits), and no explicit communication between agents. Recent work has developed algorithms that converge to stable matchings when one side (the proposers or agents) must learn their preferences, but the preferences of the other side (the proposees or arms) are common knowledge, and the matching mechanism uses simultaneous proposals at each round. We develop new algorithms that provably converge to stable matchings for two more challenging settings: one where the arm preferences are no longer common knowledge, and a second, more general one where the arms are also uncertain about their preferences. In our algorithms, agents start with optimistic beliefs about arms' preferences and update these preferences over time. The key insight is in how to combine these beliefs about arm preferences with beliefs about the value of matching with an arm conditional on one's proposal being accepted when choosing whom to propose to.</description>

      <title>From homeostasis to resource sharing: Biologically and economically aligned multi-objective multi-agent AI safety benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing safe, aligned agentic AI systems requires comprehensive empirical testing, yet many existing benchmarks neglect crucial themes aligned with biology and economics, both time-tested fundamental sciences describing our needs and preferences. To address this gap, the present work focuses on introducing biologically and economically motivated themes that have been neglected in current mainstream discussions on AI safety - namely a set of multi-objective, multi-agent alignment benchmarks that emphasize homeostasis for bounded and biological objectives, diminishing returns for unbounded, instrumental, and business objectives, sustainability principle, and resource sharing. We implemented eight main benchmark environments on the above themes, to illustrate key pitfalls and challenges in agentic AI-s, such as unboundedly maximizing a homeostatic objective, over-optimizing one objective at the expense of others, neglecting safety constraints, or depleting shared resources.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamic Diffusion Process of LLM-based Agents under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models have been used to simulate human society using multi-agent systems. Most current social simulation research emphasizes interactive behaviors in fixed environments, ignoring information opacity, relationship variability and diffusion diversity. In this paper, we study the dynamics of information diffusion in 12 asymmetric open environments defined by information content and distribution mechanisms. We first present a general framework to capture the features of information diffusion. Then, we designed a dynamic attention mechanism to help agents allocate attention to different information, addressing the limitations of LLM-based attention. Agents start by responding to external information stimuli within a five-agent group, increasing group size and forming information circles while developing relationships and sharing information. Additionally, we observe the emergence of information cocoons, the evolution of information gaps, and the accumulation of social capital, which are closely linked to psychological, sociological, and communication theories.</description>

      <title>MIXRTs: Toward Interpretable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Mixing Recurrent Soft Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While achieving tremendous success in various fields, existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a black-box neural network makes decisions in an opaque manner that hinders humans from understanding the learned knowledge and how input observations influence decisions. In contrast, existing interpretable approaches usually suffer from weak expressivity and low performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIXing Recurrent soft decision Trees (MIXRTs), a novel interpretable architecture that can represent explicit decision processes via the root-to-leaf path and reflect each agent's contribution to the team. Specifically, we construct a novel soft decision tree using a recurrent structure and demonstrate which features influence the decision-making process. Then, based on the value decomposition framework, we linearly assign credit to each agent by explicitly mixing individual action values to estimate the joint action value using only local observations, providing new insights into interpreting the cooperation mechanism. Theoretical analysis confirms that MIXRTs guarantee additivity and monotonicity in the factorization of joint action values. Evaluations on complex tasks like Spread and StarCraft II demonstrate that MIXRTs compete with existing methods while providing clear explanations, paving the way for interpretable and high-performing MARL systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete GCBF Proximal Policy Optimization for Multi-agent Safe Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety constraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.</description>

      <title>Discovering Antagonists in Networks of Systems: Robot Deployment</title>

Abstract: A contextual anomaly detection method is proposed and applied to the physical motions of a robot swarm executing a coverage task. Using simulations of a swarm's normal behavior, a normalizing flow is trained to predict the likelihood of a robot motion within the current context of its environment. During application, the predicted likelihood of the observed motions is used by a detection criterion that categorizes a robot agent as normal or antagonistic. The proposed method is evaluated on five different strategies of antagonistic behavior. Importantly, only readily available simulated data of normal robot behavior is used for training such that the nature of the anomalies need not be known beforehand. The best detection criterion correctly categorizes at least 80% of each antagonistic type while maintaining a false positive rate of less than 5% for normal robot agents. Additionally, the method is validated in hardware experiments, yielding results similar to the simulated scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art approach, both the predictive performance of the normalizing flow and the robustness of the detection criterion are increased.</description>

      <title>Shifting Power: Leveraging LLMs to Simulate Human Aversion in ABMs of Bilateral Financial Exchanges, A bond market study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilateral markets, such as those for government bonds, involve decentralized and opaque transactions between market makers (MMs) and clients, posing significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. To address these complexities, we introduce TRIBE an agent-based model augmented with a large language model (LLM) to simulate human-like decision-making in trading environments. TRIBE leverages publicly available data and stylized facts to capture realistic trading dynamics, integrating human biases like risk aversion and ambiguity sensitivity into the decision-making processes of agents. Our research yields three key contributions: first, we demonstrate that integrating LLMs into agent-based models to enhance client agency is feasible and enriches the simulation of agent behaviors in complex markets; second, we find that even slight trade aversion encoded within the LLM leads to a complete cessation of trading activity, highlighting the sensitivity of market dynamics to agents' risk profiles; third, we show that incorporating human-like variability shifts power dynamics towards clients and can disproportionately affect the entire system, often resulting in systemic agent collapse across simulations. These findings underscore the emergent properties that arise when introducing stochastic, human-like decision processes, revealing new system behaviors that enhance the realism and complexity of artificial societies.</description>
