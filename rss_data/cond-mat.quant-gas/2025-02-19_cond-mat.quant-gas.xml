      <title>Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12392v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.</description>

      <title>Canted magnetism and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization in metallic states of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model near quarter filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment has examined ultracold, fermionic, spin-1/2 $^6$Li atoms in the Lieb lattice at different Hubbard repulsion $U$ and filling fractions $\nu$ (Lebrat et al. arXiv:2404.17555). At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of polaritons at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.</description>

      <title>Probing dielectric breakdown in Mott insulators through current oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric breakdown of mesoscopic Mott insulators, a phenomenon where a strong electric field destabilizes the insulating state, resulting in a transition to a metallic phase. Using the Landau-Zener formalism, which models the excitation of a two-level system, we derive a theoretical expression for the threshold value of the field. To validate our predictions, we present an efficient protocol for estimating the charge gap and threshold field via non-equilibrium current oscillations, overcoming the computational limitations of exact diagonalization. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical formula for systems with small gaps. Moreover, our findings are directly testable in ultracold atomic experiments with ring geometries and artificial gauge fields, as our method uses measurable quantities and relies on already available technologies. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimentally realizable protocols, providing tools to explore non-equilibrium mesoscopic phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent localization of spin-orbit and Rabi-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the spin-orbit (SO) and Rabi couplings on the localization of the spin-1/2 condensate trapped in a one-dimensional random potential. Our studies reveal that the spin-dependent couplings create distinct localization regimes, resulting in various relations between localization and spin-related properties. First, we examine the localization in the linear condensate and find that the SO coupling can lead to a transition of the localized state from the "basin-like" to the "void" region of the potential. For a weak random potential upon an increase in the SO coupling, we find a re-entrant transition from a broad to narrow localized state and back at a higher SO coupling. Further, we analyze the competing role of inter-species and intra-species interactions on the localization of the condensate. We find the appearance of spin-dependent localization as the interactions increase beyond threshold values for a sufficiently strong disorder. Our findings on controlling spin-dependent localization may be useful for future ultracold atomic experiments and corresponding spin-related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical probing of high-order spin coherence in one-dimensional mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional SU(2) ultracold fermions near the Tonks-Girardeau limit, confined in a box potential. The system is driven out of equilibrium by initially preparing the two spin components in a fully separated configuration, and its evolution is described by the Hamiltonian in the presence of strong repulsive interactions. Building on the results in [arXiv:2302.02828, Phys$.$Rev. A, 107, L061301 (2023)], we extend the analysis to out-of-equilibrium dynamics, uncovering the emergence of time-dependent oscillating high-momentum tails in the momentum distribution. These oscillations, due to the finite size of the system, are governed by a nonlocal, high-order spin coherence term, whose amplitude and phase evolve over time. We show that this term initially grows as time to the power N/2 and subsequently follows the spin-mixing dynamics of the system. Notably, when the spin components are fully mixed, the amplitude of this border-to-border spin coherence reaches its maximum value.</description>

      <title>Universal Turbulent States of Miscible Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate turbulence in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a box potential using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Turbulence is driven by an oscillating force, causing the components to oscillate either in-phase (co-oscillating) or out-of-phase (counter-oscillating). A parameter measuring component separation (0 for overlap, 1 for full separation) reveals two turbulent states: coupled (the parameter $\sim0$) and decoupled (the parameter $\sim0.5$). Co-oscillating flows transition between these states at a critical interaction strength, while counter-oscillating flows consistently show the decoupled state. A probabilistic model predicts the decoupled state's parameter as $\sqrt{4/\pi - 1} = 0.523$, consistent with simulations.</description>

      <title>Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13519v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable scattering resonances are crucial for controlling atomic and molecular systems. However, their use has so far been limited to ultracold temperatures. These conditions remain hard to achieve for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems -- a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we measure inelastic collision probabilities for ${\text{Sr}^++\text{Rb}}$ and use them to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower ($f=1$) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in ${\text{Sr}^+}+{\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.</description>
